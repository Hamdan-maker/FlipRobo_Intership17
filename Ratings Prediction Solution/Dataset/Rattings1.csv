Rattings,Review
3,"PROS1. Its touch screen2. it doesn't have any fans, so doesn't make a sound.3. model is very stylish4. best for studentsCONS1. it's not 360 convertible2. it doesn't have a screensaver option3. it has a storage space of 49 gb instead of 64 gb, but works fine.4. connectivity to bluetooth is slow5. camera quality is really bad6. doesn't support all android apps7. keys are dysfunctional but you can work around it."
3,"Pros1. Boots within 5 seconds (I bet u might have never seen anything like this before)2. ‚ÄúOk Google‚Äù assistant like Siri3. Easy access like an android mobile phone4. Don‚Äôt be fooled this is not a tab, can access all android apps. Some inbuilt paid apps available for free.5. Gives Macbook like feel, fast charging and superb battery.6. Best for business travelers, presentation speakers, online teaching, learning, browsing.Cons1. Less storage capacity (usable is around 45GB only) but online cloud storage is available2. Meant only for document typing and browsing purpose, nothing much you can expect other watching movies.3. Its all Google and Google only.4. Beginners will find it a bit difficult to use this. Needs a bit of practice.5. No LAN port available. Only wifi."
1,"Screen is not upto the mark at this price point! Bad viewing angles, can see only yellowish tinge from any other angle other than the front!"
4,"The device is great when it comes to built quality, performance, trackpad, etc. I specially love speakers and mainly the keyboard which has good travel and it's just a joy to type on. I also like the Chrome OS which is better than Windows when you are going for budget laptops as they work faster.But the real problem is the display, it's 720p which is good for the price, but it has colour shifting problem like an TN display. The white balance is out of this world and there is no option to change it on the chromebook. So you need to live with it. There are even times I need to bend and watch as I can't even see anything while siting in the normal position. This isn't just my device fault, this model's display is designed like that. So I am really really warning you to check the reviews on the web before buying, mainly about the display."
4,The laptop arrived in a good condition and it was packed well. But it didn't have any receipt or warranty card inside even though a one year warranty is mentioned on Amazon. Please get back to me.
1,Device is good looking and decent.The keyboard is plastic and flimsy and letters are not visible.Screen flickering on video calls or youtube and distortedNot all android apps are supported which is supported in android phone.Screen has vertical line issues
1,"Do not fall into the trap of buying this product, this is HP‚Äôs conspiracy to dump an inferior product in the name of a chromebook. Ideally windows laptop are supposed to be expensive because of the payout for the OS & hence Chromebooks are supposed to be cheaper. In spite of this arrangement this laptop feels cheaper than a 25k windows laptop with probably a bigger screen. My mistake of trusting a brand like HP blindfoldedly. Not to mention the pain of dealing with a defective product on top of it."
1,The product is of very cheap quality and it does not support the commonly used Zoom app which is very much required in today‚Äôs Pandey situation.Poor
5,"My first Chromebook purchase. I wasn't sure how the shift from windows is going to be. But Chrome OS is great - quick, smooth, safe and very light on processor and battery.So the HP Chromebook 14a looks very premium in the silver color and its extremely light to carry around. The battery lasts for around 12 hours which seems unbelievable but it's true.I have used it for the office work with Google docs and the video conference calls and also for streaming movies. Does everything quite easily.It's been more than 2 months of using this and I can easily recommend HP CHROMEBOOK 14A for anyone looking to buy a laptop in the 25-30k price bracket. I got it under 25k during a deal and I feel it's absolutely BANG FOR THE BUCK!!"
1,Display is not working during whatsapp video call.Display is blur and fedded during video calling.
1,"Chromebook is not a matured product yet. Many apps which work on Android devices don't get installed on Chromebook or don't work similar to Android devices. This gap should be fixed by Google Play Store otherwise it's waste of investment on Chromebook ideology. Also keyboard missing delete button. I'm now using it for few months and there are already lot of bugs in Chrome OS like it keeps auto right clicking all the time rendering the laptop unuseful, rebooting multiple times helps pause this issue for some time. Product seems not properly tested before releasing."
1,Laptop is good with touch screen. But it is chrome os and can't install windows os so I wasted money buying this. They are not taking returning this product also üòîüòî
5,"This chromebook is awesome.Pros: 1. It is lightweight and super fast (boots up and shuts down within 5 seconds)2. Battery lasts for 12- 15 hours for continuous tasks, it takes about 2 hours to charge fully.3. Screen sensitivity is up to mark.(Touchscreen sensitivity)4.Does all the basic job . I would recommend this to those buyers who want a laptop for daily light to medium based work like streaming, browsing, online classes ,watching movies ,listening to music,  a little editing and programming. At this price range you will not get such laptop with such a high quality.5. No lag at all. For buyers this is based on chrome os and not windows, so first time chrome os users may find it a bit difficult to use.6. Better than any windows operated laptop (within 30-35k)Cons: 1. The webcam quality is not so good but does the job.2. It is strictly not for gaming purpose or heavy editing or programming like java or C++.3. It does not run all the applications available on playstore.4. Storage capacity is low (49 gb only) , so I would suggest you to buy an external micro sd card for increasing storage capacity. So , this chromebook is basically made for students. Students can definitely but it without any hesitation(better than any other laptop within 30-35k). But for gamers and heavy editors , I would suggest you not to buy it. Thank you."
2,"Pros-1.Fast and light2.Touchscreen is good3.Battery lasts long(10+ hours)and charging from 0 to 100 takes only a hour and few mins.4.Sound quality is good. Cons-1. Less storage2. Camera quality is extremely bad.3. Not all apps from play store is supported.4. Texts and display quality is poor and it's glitch a bit except from chrome browser. (Not suitable for reading :( )5. No backlit keyboard6. Chrome browser runs automatically when start.6. Screen brightness is always default (need to change it lower everytime when start) üò¨üò™7. Chrome browser setting like (on start up, continue where you left off)is not available. Need to minimize chrome browser again and again. :(8. Display turn off automatically after 15 mins and it can't be changed.:("
5,"Do NOT get fooled by the negative reviews, it‚Äôs a great laptop!Most of the negative reviews here (or on Flipkart) are because people are buying this Chromebook (or the 14a-na0003tu, which is the same device in SIlver instead of White) expecting it to be a full-fledged powerful laptop which it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs like buying a bicycle expecting it to be a motorbike and then whining because the bicycle is not acting like a motorbike.The screen is fairly bright for indoor usage and decent viewing angles. It is a touch-sensitive screen as well, in case you‚Äôre into that kind of stuff. However, the screen is glossy instead of matte so you can see a lot of reflections unless kept at specific angles. It's also 'sticky', so you'll get a lot of dust even if you don't touch the screen, and a lot of fingerprints if you do. I'd suggest buying a set of microfiber cloth alongside it.The speakers aren‚Äôt very clear or loud, but they are front-firing (instead of some laptops where it‚Äôs at the bottom ‚Äî why?) they sound fine.I was expecting the performance to be mediocre while buying since it has just an Intel Celeron processor with 4GB of RAM, but ChromeOS is surprisingly light and my usage has been smooth so far. The laptop boots up (and shuts down) in seconds and you can also link it with your Android phone and do Internet sharing and notification syncing. It does not lag and works just fine even with a lot of apps open at the same time. There is only 64GB of inbuilt storage, out of which only around 45 GB is available, and you can expand via a microSD card if you need, but you probably won‚Äôt need to since most apps are Web-based.Regarding the availability of apps, it‚Äôs mostly Web apps that can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store and have almost the entire functionality when compared to their Windows or macOS versions. Progressive Web Apps (the little Install icon on the right of the address bar when you open sites like YouTube or Spotify) can also be installed and they work the same way. You can also install any website as an app even if it‚Äôs not a PWA. You can also download Android apps from the Google Play Store but the experience is a mixed bag. A lot of the apps are optimised for Android phones with comparatively smaller screens and have weird scaling issues when opened in full screen. But a lot of them run fine without any issues, just like they would do on your Android phone. And yes, you can use MS Office on this laptop by either the Web-based version or the Android app, both of which have enough features to not make you miss the Windows or macOS versions.There‚Äôs Linux support as well, which is still in Beta, but the feature works fine for a general use case. And it keeps getting better with every ChromeOS update. You can use the terminal to install Linux based apps and most of them work without any major issues.And there‚Äôs the Google Assistant (with ‚ÄúOk Google‚Äù), which if you already use, I don‚Äôt need to explain the greatness, and if you don‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt explain the greatness ‚Äî you have to use it to experience it.The keyboard is nice to type on. The keys are big and have good travel and there‚Äôs no wobble in them. The keys on this particular model are white with black text and have a little grainy finish on them which look and feels very nice (I can‚Äôt say the same for the Silver version). The plastic touchpad is big and accurate and I did not find any issues with it. The camera will not blow anyone‚Äôs mind but is good with decent colours and a wide-angle.The battery life is amazing! It lasts around 8 hours easily with moderate use like web development and some music playing in the background. If you‚Äôre just watching movies or using Google Docs or Word, it should last even longer.One thing to note is that the laptop expiration date is June 2026, which means it will still work just fine, but will not receive any new ChromeOS updates after that. This does not depend on when you‚Äôre buying the laptop, so don‚Äôt expect it to last long if you‚Äôre getting it later in its lifetime.The only two cons I can find here are the lack of a backlit keyboard and a 720p display instead of a 1080p display. But I can‚Äôt complain about it at this price.Overall, it‚Äôs a good laptop for general home usages like watching movies, playing some light games and document processing. You can also do some light programming on this because of the Linux support. If that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôre looking for, I would recommend this over any Windows laptop at this price.Do NOT get fooled by the negative reviews, it‚Äôs a great laptop!Most of the negative reviews here (or on Flipkart) are because people are buying this Chromebook (or the 14a-na0003tu, which is the same device in SIlver instead of White) expecting it to be a full-fledged powerful laptop which it‚Äôs not.

3,"Firstly Product description is misleading . It only has an eMMC  but title says SSDDevice is light weight & fine for light productivity use , school work etc . But struggles with heavy mid- heavy workloads . CPU is the limiting factor understandably .OS  is snappy & frequently updated üëçüèº. Screen is average ,not that good  for movies & photo viewing  . Lacks contrast & colour depth .  Wifi stability could be better .Make sure you check the warranty details for computer purchases .I got a device with warranty start date 10 days before purchase . Both Amazon customer care & HP were hesitant to change it to actual delivered date . EXPECTED AMAZON CC TO PITCH IN PROACTIVELY,  INSTEAD OF AN ""IT CAN'T BE DONE"" KIND OF RESPONSE ."
3,"The Legendary chrome book,  that performs like a 2gb ram, (it's 4gb ram model ), I had to return the first one and since there's no option for refund,  had it replaced by another one,  thanks anyways,  second one same model is working fine but not the 4gb models performance,  updated it to latest version of chrome,  using it as daily driver,  since it's upgrade of my 2gb Acer chrome book which is still doing good,  this one's not up to the mark,  sorry Hp, I wasted 25k on this honestly,  buyers looking for Hp chrome book, Avoid all together!!"
5,I am writing this review after using 1week.Nice product my daughter loved it and very easy to use for kidsAdvantages1 slim and thin2 less wait and easy to carry3 os is fast4 download all android apps which supports to chrome os5 Battery backup superDisadvantagesLess storageCannot add widgetsLess usb ports
4,"overall the product is good ..thickness is very good......light weight ...and touch screen good....pubg gaming and cod gaming is not that good unless u add some graphic card or etc......the only problem is the display , but for this price range it is the best laptop for a collage students .........basic gaming is very good no lags ....and another problem is miscroft apps are paid apps , u need to buy them to use them......portable laptop......"
5,"I have been using it for 4 months, its my secondary device.pros:1.Good battery life2.Touch is good, better not to use because it is not convertible3.Good keyboard4.HD+ good screen5.simple OS6.Boots in 5 seconds7.Good speakers8.Charges in 1 hour9.Brightness is good10.Updates are frequent.Cons:1.White balance of screen is different in different angles2.No backlit keyboard3.Camera is average4.the processor can handle simple games(like alto's odyssey) from playstore or simultaneously run 6 apps or 25 tabs in chrome over that you will face lag5.laptop is bit heavier."
5,"Okay, as a tech enthusiast, I've been looking for a Chromebook for a while and after doing some research, I narrowed down to this.Firstly, the delivery was the same day, which I didn't want to believe to be fair, but it happenedA few things to keep in mind before you buy a Chromebook in general, is that they are not your windows or Mac devices. Although the functionality of the devices will be limited, these are still quite capable devices.Coming to this particular device, What I love about this:The keyboard is surprisingly better than i was expecting at this price pointIt is a touch screen which I might not use, but will come in handy for most peoplethe trackpad is decentbattery life is greatThere is a bit of a learning curve but you will enjoy the deviceConsThe screen isn't full HDBuild quality is plastic, good plastic, but plastic nonethelessOverall, this Chromebook can be a daily use laptop for many people who are looking for Web Browsing, WFH and Basic task.Please don't expect this Chromebook to run premiere pro or photoshop. And please don't look at things it can't do look at things that it can."
5,"Its a mind blowing purchase , At the very little cost you are getting a great quality product performance is mind blowing looks are mind blowing and if we compare it with the MacBook air it is giving a tough competition to it and chrome OS is mind blowing no lags know and complexity it is very easy to use and you have to think beyond Windows because windows constantly having problem like viruses lags crashing and all less battery back up but it has a battery backup of 12 hours, Believe in my words you would never regret if you have basic expectation With a mobile phone or laptop this is a wonderful device I recommend all an Amazon is wonderful and very helpful"
5,Best laptop under this price range .
4,"These are my first impressions about the productThe Pros is it is lightweight, has a nice touchscreen and a keyboard, so it serves as a laptop and also like a tab, which is very convenient. I found most of the features are helpful and the time it takes to start is very less, compared to the MS os. Charging is good and stays on for much of the time.Con is about the keyboard key placement, no End key or Del key which is very critical for working on Docs and Excel files. for every delete operation, we got to go to the end and press backspace ,which is irritating, also the power key is above the backspace key, and accidentally one can press the power key, which will turn off the laptop.overall it is a decent product for the price range it offers."
5,"Overall good product to buy at this price range. Very much happy and easy to carry. It is good those who looking for normal usage of browsing, YouTube videos, small games with battery üîã backup of more than 12 hours if it is charged full battery.Pros:1. Good design and light weight. Easy to carry.2. Booting Speed less than 5 seconds.3. YouTube ads are default blocked by chrome OS and more convenient to watch YouTube videos like Premium without any charges per month.4. Very Good Battery üîã backup more than 12 hours.5. Browsing and touch screen is nice.6. Fast charging support.7. Price is less 25k budget Chromebook Laptop.Cons:1. Finding difficulty to type and save word document (Ex.,) Resume typing, etc., able to do only using online Google Docs and finds difficulty in Text alignment and copy to local harddrive, but feels not much convenient like Windows OS.2. If I connect my Samsung Galaxy A70 with Type C port, files are showing very slow, and not able to copy to harddrive. Instead of copy via Type C cable, I have copied via ""InShare Android App -> Web Sharing when connected to same WiFi"".3. Bluetooth Connection is failed frequently when we disconnected, we may needs to Reboot Chromebook again for restore connection, feeling very bad for this issue. Since, I am always use Bluetooth Speaker üîä for audio / playback.4. Not all Android apps are supported like mobile phones.5. Only low memory games supported otherwise, you will endup with Screen hanged up while loading the game."
4,"After reading all the reviews, thought of giving it a try and I had mixed feelings. Here are my observations.1. Super Fast. Apps get installed at a sheer pace. Uninstalling hardly takes 2 seconds.2. Touch Screen is very good and responsive.3. HD Ready Screen, not so good. However, at this price, you can't get better. Not sure of ASUS counterpart though.4. Audio Output is average from both earphones and the speakers. Could have been a lot better. At max volume, it's very bad. Gives a rattling type output.5. Camera is just fine. Does the job for normal video calls on Skype & Zoom.6. Microsoft Excel/ Word/ PPT need 365 subscription. However you can edit or work on the above using Google Sheets/Docs/Slides.7. You can set wallpaper on homescreen (From any source, Your files too) as well as Lockscreen (Only from Google Photos)Overall, ""Can Try"" device for this price point."
1,"Bought this in March 2021. Stopped working in a few days.Engineer came and fixed, suggesting issue with battery.In mid July laptop stopped working again. Engineer visited and replaced the motherboard.Then asked to call HP for installing operating system! HP call center after hours of wasting my time asked me to visit service center.Nobody picks calls at the service center. Mumbai has only one, that too at Sakinaka.Service center guy says you need to bring a 32 GB bootable hardisk with software preloaded from HP website."
4,"Chromebook does not allow you to sideload apps from storage.Apps can be installed from official app store only. (workarounds ie development mode is painful)So if you are considering it for use with Byju's app or similar, Pl don't.MS office doesn't work either, so you need to use WPS office or similar.However, that said, as long as you are okay with aforementioned restrictions, this is a wonderful notebook with great battery backup."
5,"Good for students and employees who need laptop for office use like excel, ppt, etc. Not at all recommend for one  who are expertise especially in graphic design, animation, high end games etcc.ProExcellent touchscreenLight weightAttractiveFast100 gb Google cloud for 1 year.Mobile Google to laptop Google synchronisationDis advEMC hardisk that only 64 gbNot for high end users,.Not all android app are working in laptop"
5,This laptop is a perfect chromebook.1. Its battery life is amazing2. Cheap affordable touch screen laptop3. Can easily replace your windows laptop4. Runs almost same like your android phone5. More user-friendly than a windows laptop
1,"No. Don't waste money by taking this labtop, unless it will allow Windows operating system to install. It's just large version of mobile with bigger screen. There is no difference between this labtop & mobile. Unfortunately, I have wasted money by taking this labtop. Even company not provide microsoft office for free."
5,"The product is excellent for office use. 7 hours battery life with light music in the background while working on docs. The battery life is a huge win.Keyboard is excellent! I do a lot of drafting and found the keyboard accurate and comfortable. The touchscreen is a huge plus, I've stopped carrying/using a mouse with me.You can install linux based apps on the chromebook as well. Thereby, the overall value for money is just top notch."
5,Chromebook is better than windows my children loved it but they should give laptop bag also overall very nice
3,"Only for browsing and watching movies, best for student online classes, not at all used for office work. Just like a android tab with keyboard. Windows OS users please make sure to double check before buying there is no return policy, I bought it for office use and now using for kids online classes üòî"
1,Laptop getting hang very much and very much slow start.This is happening within 2 days of purchase

5,"Was worried about speed issues that many had complained in the reviews. But still went ahead with the purchase. After powering on there is quite a few updates that will happen. At that time i found it to be slow(background downloads and installations will happen) Go to updates and ensure that there are no pending updates. Once all the updates are applied, the laptop is perfectly fine. My kid is using for schools and other assignment. If you are using a browser + MS office applications +zoom(or other vide chat apps), there is absolutely no problem with this laptop. it is absolutely fine. Not sure about gaming though"
2,"Lookwise & bodywise ok. But it is too slow and hangs a lot, dont buy it..."
1,"I had purchased this laptop, and got it with faulty one, immediately replaced it and got one more with display faulty. Put my laptop into refund, and these amazon people made me run behind them so much and nearly 2 weeks after they took laptop from me, and they still didnt initiate the refund.worst experience for the first time with amazon.Please dont buy htis and waste ur time as well as ur money.Amazon has falled down for me now."
1,"The product was defective and it took a couple of months to just initiate a return . Calling the customer support for help took a while . The technicians didn‚Äôt turn up at all. The person who came to take the return item didn‚Äôt have patience to turn on the laptop and check the serial number and did not pick up the item . The second time after initiating the return I just received a message that said couldn‚Äôt pick up the item from customer . I‚Äôm always home , no calls from Amazon but just received a message that the item could not be picked up . I had a lesson that valuable items should not be ordered online ."
3,Suggesting to go for SSD instead of hdr as it tooks a solid 40 seconds for booting which is very annoying.
4,Value for money laptop from an branded manufacturer.
5,"Good laptop under budget with all specifiction required.Little slow while starting, rest behaving good while working.Plastic quality of laptop disappointed this could be better."
1,"The product is worst. It is a 11th gen i3 processor, but the performance is dead slow. The display is faulty. Lot of white spots on the display when the screen is black. Poor customer service from Amazon. Still waiting for service arranged by Amazon. They sell faulty electronic items and do not allow refund to return. Who need a replacement faulty device? Bad experience"
4,Good product .Have decent speed for daily use .The keypad buttons are big enough and feels good .The storage space is more than sufficient .The genuine windows 10 and ms office package come with it .It's light weight and easy to carry.However on flop side the key board is made of plastic whivh could have been better.do not come with licensed anti virus device.The ram speed could have been better and the I3 processor could have been upgraded. Over all it'd decent product for its purchase cost.
2,"I just got this yesterday and it took close to 4 hours to get it setup. Even after spending that much time, here are some issues still bothering me.1. No proper instructions or warranty information present.2. MS Office was not present. Had to contact HP support to install it..but it still doesnt work. It asks for activation key.3. Microphone quality is very poor. The person on the other side cannot hear me properly.4. When i connect the headphones, they are not detected.5. System is very very slow (probably because of all the software getting updated). But even after 12 hours it is slow so can't exactly blame software update.6. The plastic and overall quality looks cheap.7. No number lock indicator.8. Fan is too noisy and CPU/Memory/Disk one of it is always close to 100%.So i am thinking of returning this if the issues are not resolved in a day or two."
5,"Although it is too early to provide a feedback with only two days of use however I am providing this feedback because the experience is too good till now. Few additional features can add more user friendly experience like it doesn't contains keyboard background light. Also, the first time when you open the laptop, it started taking update from Microsoft. So connect with a good LAN or Wi-Fi and be patient to install the update."
1,"I ordered it during sale at 41K . Unfortunately could not returned it during return window.Its not at all worth the price. It's terribly slow. Don't go by the configuration.I am a Dell and Apple fan, bought HP first time. My 7 year old Dell laptop has much more faster performance and good built. It was bought at same range 40KOnly good things about this one are loud & clear sound quality and its light weight.All other things bad.Would not recommend it."
2,"Don't waste your hard earned money in this waste product. Not worth buying. For the first time i am writing review. Takes too long to start, has a plastic body which makes it look so cheap."
1,Very worst and poor performance and taking the much time to open the applications and folders as well. It‚Äôs did not meet the expectations as per the item description. And Amazon is misleading the public with fake information and without quality check of products they are selling and making the customers fools. I sincerely request to all don‚Äôt encourage this product and as well as Amazon as well. This is not 1st time it was happened earlier and I had a bad experience with the same HP product. Finally the same issue has happened. I really fed up with Amazon customer service and products. Don‚Äôt believe Amazon especially with electronic gadgets.
4,"Product is good . But the processor use little bit lagging. When I power on, after that it will take a time to open a app.Also I don't like the cover skin.*Products is light weighted* display is awesome cool.*Charging time is less*Sound quality is good"
1,Vary vary poor quality....plz gyus don't buy this laptop üôÑüôÑ
3,"Packing worst, everything is opened not sealed used or notLittle bit price highBody is cheap qualityWorking wise goodBooting btine little lag maybe not 15.6 inc"
1,"It is system with 8GB, but working like 2GB system. Frequently hanging, any operation there is lag. mouse pointer also struck always. it always asks for restart the laptop. Rs.41000/- is waste for this machine."
4,"Reading good comments here, bought this. Been using this since 3 days, and I see slowness, installed only chrome. Chrome doesnt open fast, had to do some diagnostics to improve performance (marginal). I have now scheduled a technician visit, if that doesnt solve, I'm returning.After writing this review, I see good performance :) not sure what changed. I believe, the OS was downloading stuff and optimising. Have been using this since a week now and no complaints"
5,"I am using since 2 months,  its very eay to use, easy to install all applications. I booked installation service which helped me divide the hard disk into 3 allocations. Windows and Microsoft Office are lifetime valid. I also use for multiple software applications, rarely lags."
2,After two month of use I am writing this review.please dont Buy is laptop as it is very very slow. It takes too much time to start also. As I am not using any antivirus software than also speed is very poor.
3,"Construction quality is not good... Intial start take linger after that ok. Hinges are not smooth and rigid, battery life is not impressive. For students ok.. Or first laptop users not find differences."
4,I likeProcessor speed display all connectivity fast charging battery backup upto 5 hours lightweight slim design overall good packageDislikePlastic type body design matte finish colour feel like low quality material and last the power button not feeling so good

1,Please don't west your money3months I'm buying the productEvery 5days I'm going to hp service centerHe's clean the ram and hard diskRunning performance very very very slowly
2,"I bought this Laptop considering HP name. However,  this Laptop is disappointing. Using for 3 months now. first,  it is extremely slow. takes lot of time to startup. Second, it gives problem in running exam software which usually runs on other Laptops. When i click on hardware diagnostic,  it goes into restart mode and doesn't come up. i had to shut down restart atleast 10 times and then it came up. Better to get laptop from US, Singapore if you know someone for good quality."
4,Go for it when you are looking for a HP laptop having reasonable configuration.
5,Always before HP always keep its standard.Its very nice to use and light weight.HD screen is too good and sound clarity also very nice.Delivery from Amazon prime also very speed.I got the product on the 3rd day from I ordered.Thanks for Amazon and HP
1,"Bought this laptop for online classes for my daughter‚Äôs online classes. Unfortunately the laptop is too slow to do anything, even Google meet is very slow. I know this is a budget laptop but nothing except for very casual browsing is possible with this. Screen and camera are also very very outdated. I would advise anyone looking at this laptop to add some extra money and get something i3 plus at least. Buy something future proof, this laptop feels like something from 20 years back."
5,Super quality loved it
4,Good product good speed i bought at 25600
5,"If you want Laptop only to do work faster this is best for You,if you want to enjoy movies it's for youIf you play low resolution games it's for youIf you think of playing high end games definitely not for you"
5,I gifted it to my small son for online lectures and it's work well without any lack... Battery is also superb. Only processor should  be improved..
2,It has been 1 month and the laptop started hanging. I know the system will be slow because of the configuration. But this is too slow.
1,"Waste of Money..... This Laptop is way too slow. It has been only 20 days since I brought this and it's very slow. It hangs, sometimes the screen blurs and I have to restart it to resolve the blur issue.DON'T BUY THIS!! EVEN FOR ONLINE CLASSES."
5,"This is good laptop for the cost, light weight and handles well. It's slower than i3 processors but that's expected."
5,"I don't know about gaming, for photo shop nice no additional ram, overall nice, battery backup nice"
5,Excellent performance for usual office works.. multi-tasking and light weight and durable.
5,"1.Light weight, handy.2. Fast / good for basic multitasking3. Easy to use4. Suitable for travel and office/ student use5. Valu for money6. Battery backup.... decent**Overall ratings (4 to 4.5/5)**"
5,It's worth the price. The screen is not as big as it looks in the review pictures. It's compact. The keyboard is not cluttered and the OS is fast. Worth the cost especially if its your first laptop purchase.

5,"I am using this laptop for a week and feeling so much thankful to my choice of purchase as it is working accordingly my expectations .This laptop was manufactured in Apr 21 and have great features like fingerprints 256GB ssd which gives flawless speed and having fast charging capacity although it is not full HD but still not much difference in picture quality comparatively.The most favored thing in this laptop is that is of only 21350 INR by HDFC credit EMI transaction .As I bought it for study purpose, it is one of the best laptop in this price range."
5,"This is such a premium looking laptop at this price point. Extremely light weight, classy looking body and keyboard, ssd boot, pre-installed windows 10, fingerprint recognition along with new features from the updated os. Everything is beautiful in both form and function. I am very satisfied with it, the packaging and even the small and compact power cable. Can't believe something so good can be available at this price point. The boot time is significantly fast than other laptops, comparable with macbook. I am techy and very nitpicky about gadget features and specifications at a given price. So this laptop is awesome in every sense!I just received it today. Will update this post if i see in any issues in the coming months."
4,"Thin and light but delicate too. Bought it for 23K, so bit pricy. As Win10 has Windows Defender, no need for redundant Antivirus program. So uninstalled McAFee as it slows down entry level systems. Uninstalled Microsoft Office 365 trial copy and installed MS Office 2010. The system is working fine and smooth for daily works like Web browsing, MS Office etc.P.S  It seems this model with Celeron 4020 is putup for sale since May '21, and hence old reviews here are for earlier model GQ329 with Celeron 3350 processor.  The discontinued model was sold at around ‚Çπ 18 to 20K it seems."
1,"The MRP shown was around Rs. 45,000/-, as per Prime day offer the price will be around Rs. 34000/-. To avail this offer, I took the prime membership Rs. 129/-. After exchange, the price was Rs. Rs. 24,990/-. All seemed well till now. After receiving the laptop the price on the packet was Rs. 30,000/-So the whole Prime day sale, Prime Membership was all a big BS. The exchange is yet to take place.The product is good, but the Prime day sale, big discounts etc was making fool of the customers, nothing more."
1,"Dear Sir,Recently i had buyed Asus Vivobook and week after delivery i'm facing so many problems and i had complained on 6/8/21 but your service engineer's did'nt arrived yett so tell me what can i do should i throw the product in dustbin and now i don't want any service from you and as well as amazon your service and amazon service is WORST WORST WROST and and now onwords i recommend to othewr people that don't buy any product from Amazon i want replacement or give my money back"
5,"Nice laptop. Writing this review after 1 week full usage.Pros:SSD laptop, so high speed performance.Booting time less than 15 seconds.Anti glare screen. So no eye strain after long online classes, particularly good for kids.Multi tasking working fine.No lagging found while surfing, attending online classes, working with acrobat, word, excel, powerpoint...Battery backup excellent, almost 6 hours nonstop usage....Cons:Camera quality average, but ok for online classes and meeting.Have to buy external hdd, since it has only 195 gb available space...Due to processor, high end gaming not possible.Verdict.Bought at 21k. If your budget around 20 to 25k and looking for online classes or for normal office works or office works, then definitely go for it.."
4,I Got this laptop in 23k and others are get this in 18 or 20k laptop this is not fare üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò£üò£üò£but laptop is Good
5,"It is a perfect value for money Laptop from ASUS. it is just for daily users not for gamer or edition person. I have purchased this for office work and my daughter online classes.It is really working fine. Batter life around 4-5 hrs off moderate use. Sound is good. Weight is balanced. It comes with Finger print sensor, which is fats and accurate.Don't worry about basic processor Like Intel celeron. SSD did all. Fast and smooth. U can shutdown and ON your laptop within 10 second. Restart time arround 7 second.Go for it to work moderate on daily basis.ASUS made it possible with the attractive purchase range."
5,"Best configuration at this Price ‚Çπ23k.Does the job, and does it well. Bought it for my daughter's online schooling. No issues so far.Superfast booting and shut down speed. Extra wide screen, well placed key board, biggest mousepad, separate number pad on right side, fingerprint sensor.  What more you want! Integrated Graphics card is giving desired output with speed. All branded components, with no frills.Speakers are giving crystal clear sounds.Looks are good but Silver colour finish is little bit on whiter side. Looks like plastic. Very thin, and I think 'handle with card product.Overall happy with the buy."
1,"Please dont buy.I have used for 1 month.Laptop hangs many times,Now  not starting even though charging is full.Company cheating with customers..."
5,I was in doubt that is it will be support Tally & Busy Accounting Softwares.But after buy it all things are going good.Both Softwares are working without any issues.Nice Product üëçüëç
5,"I was looking for a laptop that wasn't too expensive but had enough power to get office work, web browsing etc done. I feel glad I came accross the vivobook. It's quite good for what I had to pay in return and I would suggest anyone wanting to buy this to go for it."
5,"I'm using this laptop since 4 months. My experience with it has been very satisfying. First of all, would like to say thanks to Amazon for fast delivery and good packaging. Coming to the laptop, it is a good laptop.The screen is good, clarity is nice despite HD only resolution. The speakers sound loud and with audio enhancement inbuilt, the sound is crisp. Ideal for watching movies. It is running Celeron processor which is meant for basic tasks but surprisingly coupled with 256GB SSD, normal tasks such as browsing, reading, document editing with Office feels smooth. But remember it isn't for gaming or heavy tasks. Battery life been great due to power efficient Celeron processor. Earlier I used Core i5 10th gen, although it was powerful but battery life wasn't that great. My usage is light with some browsing, content consumption and editing documents which this laptop serves without breaking a sweat. The fingerprint scanner is nice addition which I find very useful. No need to input pin everytime to unlock. Scanner response is pretty good. Front camera is okay if there's sufficient light in the room as you'd find in this budget. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase."
5,"My kids Nursery classes started online this academic year and I though to purchase a basic laptop for him, and this one suitably serves the purpose for him. Please note incase applicable; The WebEx virtual background feature will not work on anything below the I3 range of processors, therefore it won't work on this one."
1,After opening the laptop and setting id‚Äôs and all and then restarting it OS crashed and I have to return the laptop.Nothing went well for me so I have to return this laptop
4,"I had an urgent requirement for a regular use laptop for my sister and searched amazon to find this one.Really very good deal under 23k since you are getting 256ssd for this price along with upgradable memory which originally is 4gb out of the box.Overall quality is good with quality speakers and good enough screen even though it is not full HD. But overall specs are also par for the course considering the price and brand of ASUS.But dont expect gaming in this laptop since after all it a celeron processor.I was pleasantly surprised to see a fingerprint sensor which in today's world, laptops costing 3 times more than this dont even provide. So kudos to ASUS for that."
1,Don't buy this product...  I am using this laptop in one day is very poor poor condition Asus  laptop please don't.. and Amazon giving me a damaging product and is giving very very very damaging product so I returned it this product... please don't buy
5,"This product is very outstanding if you're looking for a pc for either home,school or college use. Even though product comes with intel celeron processor, it does the job with the help of ssd. Boot up time, battery, picture, fingerprint and sound quality are very good. Awesome design as well. You cannot do gaming. Expanding the ram and ssd would fasten the system. It is light weight and useful for general browsing, home and office works, watching movies etc."
5,"It got the Great looks for sure!!Feels light & easy to carryBattery charges quicklySSD is really fast here!!Display is just okCamera is averageGaming, can run wellVery Decent laptopFor basic operationsto students & teachersBuy it only if you get itfor a good good dealIn any trusted website."
1,"This laptop sucks. No doubt what did I expect after purchasing a ASUS. The laptop does remarkable job to representing the company name, quality and service.  My laptop sporadically stops working for no good reason not even after a month I bought it. Not recommended if you want mental peace. Very dissappointed"
5,Nice laptop higher res compared to others in this price range which is nice. Very quick laptop loads up in a snap and the finger print reader actually works well.Very nice machine for the price - I am a happy customer :)
3,"Returned back and return processed First time had a problem with start as even after pressing power button it was not getting on immediately after 2 days of operation,Second time it happened after a week, It was subsequently corrected by the service engineer. After two days again it got stuck, none of the key was functioning thats why I decided to return since it is hardly 20 days from the purchase and there is some problem or the other frequently"
4,Good performance so far. Happy with the purchase. Well suited for online classes and light domestic use. Experienced a slight malfunctioning of fingerprint scanner once. Was a minor software glitch which was easily fixed after 10 min online research.
1,Everything is fine till now in laptop except one thing that I got new laptop with many scratch marks on top which will give the feeling that we are using second hand laptop instead of new.I don't think so we can expect this type of service from such a big company like Amazon.
5,"This product is excellent for daily use. Tasks associated with MS office, reading PDFs and online classes are very well managed by this system. The SSD gives a better edge to the performance. There is a dual storage facility available. Overall the laptop is a winner in terms of performance ( only if one does not play games in it). Light weight and battery backup is a plus point along with the portability and silver colour looks awesome.A must go for academicians and professionals."
5,Good product for online calss purpose. SSD is very useful. Fast. Coming with Windows 10 OS. Camera is good. Keypads are projected from the base. Easy for kids to operate. Battery back up is perfect. Screen size is bit small. But ok at this cost. Need to install MS Office on our own cost.
5,It's one those for online classes I have checked everything available online. At the end you can only choose this laptop for this budget. Before lockdown it looks like it was much cheaper few bought at 19k I bought this at 22k with offer.
1,The laptop is not worth. It is very slow in starting. You can't even complete the settings because it keeps on hanging. It starts making weird sounds anytime.
4,"You get what you pay for, I bought it for kids online classes and till now it is working very well for thatDon't expect it to support high end apps"
5,"Very good looking, fast to boot and niceWindows 10 with SSD is a value which nothing in this budget offers.Got for 23k"
1,"Screen is not smart, btw it's good for now"
3,The laptop was good but the storage is low as mentioned in Amazon there is 256 SSD but in actual there is only 237 SSD and for use only199 SSD storage so it's very bad thing I realized
4,"writing after 15dyas of using. I got it for 23000 and at this price, it's really a good deal, go for it if u need a laptop for basic work.good battery life, but the webcam has little poor quality and since it has ssd it has good speed finally the good thing is it has an anti-glare screen."
1,Not bad
4,"Very great choice but not for gaming or don‚Äôt expect high performance from this laptop, sometimes it lags a little bit, overall it‚Äôs a good package for normal use or for students and also for business work, again I would say that it kills in looks, also speakers and display are of descent and average quality. Also the camera quality is below average, according to the budget laptop it is a great one.üëçüèªüëèüèªThe speakers are placed below the laptop so the sound is also not that great.üëãüèª"
5,Video Player is loading.
4,"Laptop is best for  browsing, school office work. No good for gaming , video editing which are CPU intensive task.One can upgrade ram if lot of multitasking slows down laptop.Keyboard quality is  not that good compared to lenovo and Dell.Overall 3/5 for build quality.Overall performance 4/5 , as good as i3 ,i5 for day today tasks."
1,"There is an issue with the left speaker, it has a crackling sound and not able to hear anything clearly. Had to disable the left speaker from stereo settings.Screen quality is also not upto mark.Amazon is not ready to replace to return even one day after the return window."
5,"Best Value for money, all thanks to the nvme ssd. This laptop is more than enough for any school student and office use.Moreover you have option to upgrade the ram to 8gb."
5,"Perfect laptop for my wife, with good quality fhd screen and processor"
4,Battery capacity is a bit low but satisfactory battery life
2,"As per specification of this product  i.e keyboard back light , finger print sensor and number keypad not working in this product."
4,"i dont like much this charger, this charger is not like laptop charger"
5,I am very happy
2,Very much laggy heating issues as well as sound is also very less no able to hear esle it is not recommend
4,"Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).Clarifications/issue points:1. It‚Äôs a plastic body and not aluminium.2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.4. There‚Äôs no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it‚Äôs body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.Pros:1. Configuration is best at this price level.2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.4. It‚Äôs light weight as it‚Äôs a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.6. Display is average and gets the job done.7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it‚Äôs expandable upto 1 TB.9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it‚Äôs a really well thought product by HP.I‚Äôll update this review after one month of usage."
1,"Different charger was sent in the box by Amazon and they were not ready to provide a replacement as I had open the laptop box.Later after several calls and struggle I was able to get the replacement and now, camera is not working for the laptop.Laptop's over-all performance is nice. Buy it from a HP showroom directly instead buying it from Amazon."
5,"Amazing laptop.. I ordered this laptop on its released date i.e. 24th feb seeing it's wonderful configuration.. I must say the decision was right..Thank u HP for this superfast laptop. And after so much of research, I think in HP this is the only laptop with high configuration (11th gen, 16gb ram, 512 SSD, 14 inch screen, light weight, finger sensor & Alexa inbuilt) under this budget."
4,"As soon as I found 11gen Gen i5 at ~62K I got stuck at it & after reading some initial reviews placed an order. Got it at promised time. Here's my review after 3 days.Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance. 1.4 Kg is not too light & noticeable. People complaining about placement of Power Key button beside delete button but believe me it'll hardly ever come your way. The plastic feels like metal. The screen doesn't lift keyboard. Typing is a pleasure.Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Finger print unlock is superfast. Apps opens in no time. Gestures works perfectly. All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram & 512 NvMe SSD.Features: Comes with ""Office Home & Student 2019"" (didn't checked is it lifelong). Dropbox 25GB for 1 year also available. Comes with some HP apps & Express VPN as well. HP quick drop helps you transfer files from your phone easily. It has Type C charging point but not sure if it is delivery charging or receiving charging point. Keyboard is backlit with two setting (full & med bright).Display: Didn't checked in daylight but at home it is very bright. Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure.Camera is 720p Camera is OK. Pictures & Videos are grainy. I won't be using it much so I'm fine with that.Speakers is unbelievably very loud & clear. At 67 its was reaching all across my apartment. Speakers are on the two sides below keyboard.Only drawback I noticed was charging pin is too tight to push & pull out.I will be posting more updates on performance, battery etc & also my overall experience as I keep using more & more.Update after 2 weeks:After lot of research & by doing practical I found that this Laptop can be charged by a Type-C charger. Believe me this is an exclusive piece of information, not many people knows this. HP call center didn't knew this, HP Showroom people don't know this, even when I asked question here someone provided wrong answer. This is an important information they should have mentioned in product detail that this Laptop supports Type C charging. I'm using HP original 65 W Type C power adapter to charge it. Attaching a photo. I did some research myself & found its USB Type C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. After reading this I ordered the Type C power adapter & it worked."
2,"If you are a College student or a professional who depends heavily on laptop for pretty much everyday then  this laptop is not for you. It hangs more often than it runs. Cannot install essential computer science software such as Eclipse or android studio because then this laptop just dies.I took this laptop thinking that it will have good performance based on its configuration.But if you are someone who wants to attend online classes or just browse, then you may go for this laptop."
5,"Very Thin, light weight, fast boot, fast shut down. Longer battery life. You will love watching full HD or 4K videos on this display.As I used for 2 days, so yet to validate battery strength on regular basis. I will share battery review after 1 week.16GB Ram, L3 8MB, 6 core Ryzen 5, NVME, good finger print lock.Delivered next day by Amazon.Keyboard gives initial impact that keys letters/numbers could be bolder. But with continued use you may find it comfortable. I think silver background and light black text may gives illusion of thin text on keys. It might be due to my use of complete black body laptop with white text keys earlier. But not big deal.Software is Win Home provided. Anti virus provided is McAfee which is one month free version. It could have been 1 year. Dropbox 12 month provided free, it could have been 1 month instead of McAfee. MS Office provided is desktop version. Office 365 is not included.I will recommend better you order laptop cushion cover and keyboard cover with this. This generation laptops are very delicate not sterdy as like before"
1,"The battery is gone in a month's time it was delivered on 5-Apr-201, hardware diagnosis says battery needs to be replaced. Have already faced issues where the keys just froze and had to contact support team."
5,11 Gen Laptop with 16GB RAM is a dream combination as of now. Good deal
4,HP Pavilion laptop is slim & look premium. It's design as similar to Apple Macbook Air. I had a another HP Pavilion laptop but it had a complaint that if you open the lap the keyboard cover will slightly bend. This HP Pavilion laptop solve it's problem.Advantage1. Light Weight2. Slim Body3. Great Display & Camera4. Enriched Bang & Olufsen sound5. Output heat is place between screenDisadvantage1. To make laptop slim they had to remove Lan/Ethernet2. The Key are white. Some time we have to turn off to see the letter of the key3. Need to buy Adapter for Lan/Ethernet supply4. There are 2 USB  & One Type C USB. If u need to connect more device buy a5. Some time it is hard to physical connect to USB AConclusion: Since it has some drawback. I did buy the product for it's price & it's Brand Also. I loved it
4,"I just see one month trial version of microsoft 365, it doesn't show me option to setup ms office. can some one help me on this?"
5,"Awesome features in this laptopScreen is delight, back lit keyboard is awesome, finger print recognition is really good. I cannot imagine I could get all these features at this price. Super fast drive, free office what else you need.... 16 gb ramBeen using this for more than 2 weeks.. I am really really happy. On top of it awesome customer care service on what's app"
5,"Did a lot of research and landed on this laptop. I am not a gamer and didn't want a gaming laptop or a laptop with a dedicated graphics card. If that's your thing, then probably look elsewhere. Was not able to find this configuration anywhere for this price - 512gb SSD, 16gb RAM with i5 processor. It's an absolute beast. Everything flies and windows is looking so much better now (I was coming from a macbook pro). I was taken a back at how good this thing is. Does all the daily tasks without a sweat. The audio output is also decent (not great). Has a USB C port which can be used for charging (haven't tried this, but someone else had put a detailed review with this feature - check it out).One con: If you close the lid and connect it to an external monitor, the wifi speed drops, if you're a bit far from your router. Let me explain: my office room is a bit far away from the router (don't ask me why I set it up like this). I took the laptop there and connected it to my monitor and closed the lid and kept it on a stand. The wifi became very slow. I disconnected the monitor and opened the lid and checked to see that the wifi speed was triple now. Googled and saw that the wifi antennas are below the trackpad - so someone suggested to keep the trackpad part of the laptop on top while placing it on the stand. This helped a bit; in the end, I kept the lid a wee bit open on the stand, and this solved the issue."

5,"This is an excellent product. Appearance looks great. Start and shutdown in a blink due to NVMe SSD. All the configurations including RAM, processor, ports are well tested and optimized. Very light waight and portable for frequent travellers."
1,"Good laptop with a decent hardware spec, was able try out some heavy graphics games and sever configuration. The disappointment was the promised MS word processing software with life long validity. Where the seller did not share the product key. This is a common scenario as many other buyers are also complaining. License software subscription is around INR 1200 per year, so please factor in that also in ur owner ship cost.Again this kind of behaviour from one of the reputed sellers on the platform is disappointing."
4,"Bought this laptop DV0543TU during GreatIndianSale-2021 at 54k(including bank offers). Apart from bank offer, I also got free PRIME membership for 1 yr and Audible membership for 6 months bundled with this laptopü§©. Used this laptop for 1 week and below is detailed review üë®‚ÄçüíªPROS üëç- Expandable option available for SSD and RAM. 476 GB of available SSD memory.- Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance- Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Applications starts/loads fast- Applications like Python, PyCharm,Photoshop etc loads quickly and runs efficiently without any hiccups- Speakers are also loud, although bottom firing- Microsoft integration is seamless, hence setup is quick.- USB Type-C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. You can also charge from Type-C port.- Battery last average around 5-6 hours (however depends upon usage patterns)CONS üëé- Charging pin, USB slots is too tight to push & pull out- Does not have SD card slot or fingerprint reader, images shown in AMAZON doesn't have correct images.- No camera shutter/privacy button- If HP doesn't bundle bag, they should atleast provide a carry case or sleeveüö© Keeping aside the cons, the HP Pavilion DV0543TU with (8GB/512GB/i5-11) can be ideal machine for buyers looking for a portable yet powerful machine without a hefty price. It's like using a trimmed down version of HP ENVY premium laptop without compromising on processing power üíª !!!"
2,"Update after one month usage - MS Office 2019 preinstalled edition became unlicensed version within 30 days and refused to activate. HP support shared their product sheet that stated that this laptop came only with a trial version of MS Office 2019. Now I am chasing seller Appario Retail to honour the commitment.Bad experience after paying high price (around ‚Çπ67,000) for preinstalled genuine software.Other wise product has sleek looks, superfast fingerprint scanner, very good display, very responsive touchpad, decent (but tinny) speakers, USB C and barrel plug charging options and under 10 second boot up (SSD drive). Preloaded with Win10 Home and MS Office (not sure whether trial or full version). Drawbacks - weighs 1.42 kg, base gets warm rather quickly and so does the power adapter. Decent for a college student."
1,"Worst Amazon experience ever. This laptop arrived with a defective battery and even after 3 hours of charging, the battery level remained at 65% when the power cord was removed from supply. Immediately on removing the power cord the laptop shuts down. There is no matter any charge left on the laptop battery which seems to be defective. Never expected such a faulty product from HP. Very pathetic and really disappointed. Could not return it or replace it without booking an inspection appointment. Waiting for them to arrive and inspect it. Never buy HP products as they dont appear to be QC ed properly. Could not give a negative rating so selecting 1 star.Edited - The inspection happened 2 days after requesting for replacement. The replacement laptop was approved and ordered. It took another 2 days for Amazon to ship and deliver. However, the delivery person refused to hand over the replacement and accept the defective laptop as he could not power it on!!The actual defect was the battery and there was no way he could start it or power on without using the external power cord.The delivery person left without accepting the inspected and marked defective laptop. I‚Äôm still waiting for confirmation that the laptop will be replaced. Pathetic experience from both Amazon and HP. Would have given negative 10 stars for Earth‚Äôs customer centric company if possible."
4,"Cons:This laptop has rectangular display and if you were using MacBook 13, you might get surprised to see this screen feels smaller than that. So I suggest checking this out in physical store before buying.I did not like the mouse trackpad as it‚Äôs not very responsive and sometimes gives wrong feedback.Battery is decent, If not the best.Pros:Thin, sleek, lightweight and handy.Windows package is good with free office.Laptop in general is quite fast"
5,"Writing this review after 15 days of usage. The box contains the laptop and the charging cable. The laptop weighs  exactly 1.4 KG, and it's quite nice. It has all the specifications as advertised, i.e. 16 GB ram, and 500 GB NVME SSD. It does not have IR camera so no face unlocking will support. The finger print sensor is fast. Office 2019 is pre-installed and needs only to be activated, so while booting up for the first time it's best to have a mail id ready. the USB type C port is good and I have tested with data transfer only, not display and power output, although according to blogs and forums it will support both. Battery life is not completely tested but it's fairly ok, as of now I have got backup worth of definitely 6 hrs."
1,"HP would not consider dead pixel in warranty as they need 2 dead pixels. Above that if in case there is a dead pixel, then they will try their best to put up many reasons to not entertain it in warranty, calling it customer induced damage.. LOL..Buy this at your own risk from Amazon. Who knows what i faced was because of Amazon induced damage during delivery...Someone tell HP that most common reason for a dead pixel is a MANUFACTURING DEFECT.."
1,"A bad choice purchase from amazon. After a week of use, the laptop screen display goes off every 5 to 10 minutes. When it goes off, I need to switch the laptop on, the display comes back and after 5 minutes again goes off, again switch it on.  Tired of it. Frustrated. Don't buy electronics from Amazon."
2,It‚Äôs look like renewed laptop because laptop charging jack is loose and left side speaker sounds like it‚Äôs tear. Bad sound quality  and finger sensor quality look like 2011 touch phone of wing and any Chinese phone touch. Waste of money and one more thing day by day Amazon product quality getting poor
4,"Product design looks good, good display, tacky keyboard and good battery.The price could have been better.And missing on finger scanner!! This was missing information from the Q&AAlso office 2019 is just installed, but not activated. Microsoft account is required to activate. And If you are using a license elsewhere against the Microsoft account, then you will have trouble activating.. Factor this please"
5,"Like:Booting time is very less.Light weightSuper fastFinger touch unlock is super fastDislike:180 hinges are missingOpening lid is not designed properly, bit difficult to open the lid"
1,THE PROCESSOR MENTIONED ON WEBSITE IS OF 4.2GHZ BUT WHAT I RECIEVED IS OF 2.4GHZ
1,Had an issue with the product and the HP service support is horrible.I have called their support number about 10 times and written multiple emails. It‚Äôs been more than 10 days and nothing much has happened.Now the laptop is jst a piece of waste affecting my kids online school.
5,"This is a clean and elegant device. The keyboard strokes are so smooth and makes you to type more. Weighing at 1.75KG it handles with ease. The FHD display with thin bezels gives you an immersive viewing experience. 16GB of RAM, SSD and Ryzen 5 gives you instant responses. It also upgraded itself to Windows 11. One issue was with '@' and '#' as they couldn't be typed. HP Support asked to uninstall and reinstall keyboard driver to solve the issue. However the laptop seems to work fine now even without doing it. Fingerprint reader is fast. The aesthetics is great minus the stickers. Overall a worthy purchase. If you are eligible for exchange please use that option and use credit card for getting a better deal."
3,"PROS1. Its touch screen2. it doesn't have any fans, so doesn't make a sound.3. model is very stylish4. best for studentsCONS1. it's not 360 convertible2. it doesn't have a screensaver option3. it has a storage space of 49 gb instead of 64 gb, but works fine.4. connectivity to bluetooth is slow5. camera quality is really bad6. doesn't support all android apps7. keys are dysfunctional but you can work around it."
3,"Pros1. Boots within 5 seconds (I bet u might have never seen anything like this before)2. ‚ÄúOk Google‚Äù assistant like Siri3. Easy access like an android mobile phone4. Don‚Äôt be fooled this is not a tab, can access all android apps. Some inbuilt paid apps available for free.5. Gives Macbook like feel, fast charging and superb battery.6. Best for business travelers, presentation speakers, online teaching, learning, browsing.Cons1. Less storage capacity (usable is around 45GB only) but online cloud storage is available2. Meant only for document typing and browsing purpose, nothing much you can expect other watching movies.3. Its all Google and Google only.4. Beginners will find it a bit difficult to use this. Needs a bit of practice.5. No LAN port available. Only wifi."
1,"Screen is not upto the mark at this price point! Bad viewing angles, can see only yellowish tinge from any other angle other than the front!"
4,"The device is great when it comes to built quality, performance, trackpad, etc. I specially love speakers and mainly the keyboard which has good travel and it's just a joy to type on. I also like the Chrome OS which is better than Windows when you are going for budget laptops as they work faster.But the real problem is the display, it's 720p which is good for the price, but it has colour shifting problem like an TN display. The white balance is out of this world and there is no option to change it on the chromebook. So you need to live with it. There are even times I need to bend and watch as I can't even see anything while siting in the normal position. This isn't just my device fault, this model's display is designed like that. So I am really really warning you to check the reviews on the web before buying, mainly about the display."
4,The laptop arrived in a good condition and it was packed well. But it didn't have any receipt or warranty card inside even though a one year warranty is mentioned on Amazon. Please get back to me.
1,Device is good looking and decent.The keyboard is plastic and flimsy and letters are not visible.Screen flickering on video calls or youtube and distortedNot all android apps are supported which is supported in android phone.Screen has vertical line issues
1,"Do not fall into the trap of buying this product, this is HP‚Äôs conspiracy to dump an inferior product in the name of a chromebook. Ideally windows laptop are supposed to be expensive because of the payout for the OS & hence Chromebooks are supposed to be cheaper. In spite of this arrangement this laptop feels cheaper than a 25k windows laptop with probably a bigger screen. My mistake of trusting a brand like HP blindfoldedly. Not to mention the pain of dealing with a defective product on top of it."
1,The product is of very cheap quality and it does not support the commonly used Zoom app which is very much required in today‚Äôs Pandey situation.Poor
5,"My first Chromebook purchase. I wasn't sure how the shift from windows is going to be. But Chrome OS is great - quick, smooth, safe and very light on processor and battery.So the HP Chromebook 14a looks very premium in the silver color and its extremely light to carry around. The battery lasts for around 12 hours which seems unbelievable but it's true.I have used it for the office work with Google docs and the video conference calls and also for streaming movies. Does everything quite easily.It's been more than 2 months of using this and I can easily recommend HP CHROMEBOOK 14A for anyone looking to buy a laptop in the 25-30k price bracket. I got it under 25k during a deal and I feel it's absolutely BANG FOR THE BUCK!!"
1,Display is not working during whatsapp video call.Display is blur and fedded during video calling.
1,"Chromebook is not a matured product yet. Many apps which work on Android devices don't get installed on Chromebook or don't work similar to Android devices. This gap should be fixed by Google Play Store otherwise it's waste of investment on Chromebook ideology. Also keyboard missing delete button. I'm now using it for few months and there are already lot of bugs in Chrome OS like it keeps auto right clicking all the time rendering the laptop unuseful, rebooting multiple times helps pause this issue for some time. Product seems not properly tested before releasing."
1,Laptop is good with touch screen. But it is chrome os and can't install windows os so I wasted money buying this. They are not taking returning this product also üòîüòî
5,"This chromebook is awesome.Pros: 1. It is lightweight and super fast (boots up and shuts down within 5 seconds)2. Battery lasts for 12- 15 hours for continuous tasks, it takes about 2 hours to charge fully.3. Screen sensitivity is up to mark.(Touchscreen sensitivity)4.Does all the basic job . I would recommend this to those buyers who want a laptop for daily light to medium based work like streaming, browsing, online classes ,watching movies ,listening to music,  a little editing and programming. At this price range you will not get such laptop with such a high quality.5. No lag at all. For buyers this is based on chrome os and not windows, so first time chrome os users may find it a bit difficult to use.6. Better than any windows operated laptop (within 30-35k)Cons: 1. The webcam quality is not so good but does the job.2. It is strictly not for gaming purpose or heavy editing or programming like java or C++.3. It does not run all the applications available on playstore.4. Storage capacity is low (49 gb only) , so I would suggest you to buy an external micro sd card for increasing storage capacity. So , this chromebook is basically made for students. Students can definitely but it without any hesitation(better than any other laptop within 30-35k). But for gamers and heavy editors , I would suggest you not to buy it. Thank you."
2,"Pros-1.Fast and light2.Touchscreen is good3.Battery lasts long(10+ hours)and charging from 0 to 100 takes only a hour and few mins.4.Sound quality is good. Cons-1. Less storage2. Camera quality is extremely bad.3. Not all apps from play store is supported.4. Texts and display quality is poor and it's glitch a bit except from chrome browser. (Not suitable for reading :( )5. No backlit keyboard6. Chrome browser runs automatically when start.6. Screen brightness is always default (need to change it lower everytime when start) üò¨üò™7. Chrome browser setting like (on start up, continue where you left off)is not available. Need to minimize chrome browser again and again. :(8. Display turn off automatically after 15 mins and it can't be changed.:("
5,"Do NOT get fooled by the negative reviews, it‚Äôs a great laptop!Most of the negative reviews here (or on Flipkart) are because people are buying this Chromebook (or the 14a-na0003tu, which is the same device in SIlver instead of White) expecting it to be a full-fledged powerful laptop which it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs like buying a bicycle expecting it to be a motorbike and then whining because the bicycle is not acting like a motorbike.The screen is fairly bright for indoor usage and decent viewing angles. It is a touch-sensitive screen as well, in case you‚Äôre into that kind of stuff. However, the screen is glossy instead of matte so you can see a lot of reflections unless kept at specific angles. It's also 'sticky', so you'll get a lot of dust even if you don't touch the screen, and a lot of fingerprints if you do. I'd suggest buying a set of microfiber cloth alongside it.The speakers aren‚Äôt very clear or loud, but they are front-firing (instead of some laptops where it‚Äôs at the bottom ‚Äî why?) they sound fine.I was expecting the performance to be mediocre while buying since it has just an Intel Celeron processor with 4GB of RAM, but ChromeOS is surprisingly light and my usage has been smooth so far. The laptop boots up (and shuts down) in seconds and you can also link it with your Android phone and do Internet sharing and notification syncing. It does not lag and works just fine even with a lot of apps open at the same time. There is only 64GB of inbuilt storage, out of which only around 45 GB is available, and you can expand via a microSD card if you need, but you probably won‚Äôt need to since most apps are Web-based.Regarding the availability of apps, it‚Äôs mostly Web apps that can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store and have almost the entire functionality when compared to their Windows or macOS versions. Progressive Web Apps (the little Install icon on the right of the address bar when you open sites like YouTube or Spotify) can also be installed and they work the same way. You can also install any website as an app even if it‚Äôs not a PWA. You can also download Android apps from the Google Play Store but the experience is a mixed bag. A lot of the apps are optimised for Android phones with comparatively smaller screens and have weird scaling issues when opened in full screen. But a lot of them run fine without any issues, just like they would do on your Android phone. And yes, you can use MS Office on this laptop by either the Web-based version or the Android app, both of which have enough features to not make you miss the Windows or macOS versions.There‚Äôs Linux support as well, which is still in Beta, but the feature works fine for a general use case. And it keeps getting better with every ChromeOS update. You can use the terminal to install Linux based apps and most of them work without any major issues.And there‚Äôs the Google Assistant (with ‚ÄúOk Google‚Äù), which if you already use, I don‚Äôt need to explain the greatness, and if you don‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt explain the greatness ‚Äî you have to use it to experience it.The keyboard is nice to type on. The keys are big and have good travel and there‚Äôs no wobble in them. The keys on this particular model are white with black text and have a little grainy finish on them which look and feels very nice (I can‚Äôt say the same for the Silver version). The plastic touchpad is big and accurate and I did not find any issues with it. The camera will not blow anyone‚Äôs mind but is good with decent colours and a wide-angle.The battery life is amazing! It lasts around 8 hours easily with moderate use like web development and some music playing in the background. If you‚Äôre just watching movies or using Google Docs or Word, it should last even longer.One thing to note is that the laptop expiration date is June 2026, which means it will still work just fine, but will not receive any new ChromeOS updates after that. This does not depend on when you‚Äôre buying the laptop, so don‚Äôt expect it to last long if you‚Äôre getting it later in its lifetime.The only two cons I can find here are the lack of a backlit keyboard and a 720p display instead of a 1080p display. But I can‚Äôt complain about it at this price.Overall, it‚Äôs a good laptop for general home usages like watching movies, playing some light games and document processing. You can also do some light programming on this because of the Linux support. If that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôre looking for, I would recommend this over any Windows laptop at this price.Do NOT get fooled by the negative reviews, it‚Äôs a great laptop!Most of the negative reviews here (or on Flipkart) are because people are buying this Chromebook (or the 14a-na0003tu, which is the same device in SIlver instead of White) expecting it to be a full-fledged powerful laptop which it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs like buying a bicycle expecting it to be a motorbike and then whining because the bicycle is not acting like a motorbike.The screen is fairly bright for indoor usage and decent viewing angles. It is a touch-sensitive screen as well, in case you‚Äôre into that kind of stuff. However, the screen is glossy instead of matte so you can see a lot of reflections unless kept at specific angles. It's also 'sticky', so you'll get a lot of dust even if you don't touch the screen, and a lot of fingerprints if you do. I'd suggest buying a set of microfiber cloth alongside it.The speakers aren‚Äôt very clear or loud, but they are front-firing (instead of some laptops where it‚Äôs at the bottom ‚Äî why?) they sound fine.I was expecting the performance to be mediocre while buying since it has just an Intel Celeron processor with 4GB of RAM, but ChromeOS is surprisingly light and my usage has been smooth so far. The laptop boots up (and shuts down) in seconds and you can also link it with your Android phone and do Internet sharing and notification syncing. It does not lag and works just fine even with a lot of apps open at the same time. There is only 64GB of inbuilt storage, out of which only around 45 GB is available, and you can expand via a microSD card if you need, but you probably won‚Äôt need to since most apps are Web-based.Regarding the availability of apps, it‚Äôs mostly Web apps that can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store and have almost the entire functionality when compared to their Windows or macOS versions. Progressive Web Apps (the little Install icon on the right of the address bar when you open sites like YouTube or Spotify) can also be installed and they work the same way. You can also install any website as an app even if it‚Äôs not a PWA. You can also download Android apps from the Google Play Store but the experience is a mixed bag. A lot of the apps are optimised for Android phones with comparatively smaller screens and have weird scaling issues when opened in full screen. But a lot of them run fine without any issues, just like they would do on your Android phone. And yes, you can use MS Office on this laptop by either the Web-based version or the Android app, both of which have enough features to not make you miss the Windows or macOS versions.There‚Äôs Linux support as well, which is still in Beta, but the feature works fine for a general use case. And it keeps getting better with every ChromeOS update. You can use the terminal to install Linux based apps and most of them work without any major issues.And there‚Äôs the Google Assistant (with ‚ÄúOk Google‚Äù), which if you already use, I don‚Äôt need to explain the greatness, and if you don‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt explain the greatness ‚Äî you have to use it to experience it.The keyboard is nice to type on. The keys are big and have good travel and there‚Äôs no wobble in them. The keys on this particular model are white with black text and have a little grainy finish on them which look and feels very nice (I can‚Äôt say the same for the Silver version). The plastic touchpad is big and accurate and I did not find any issues with it. The camera will not blow anyone‚Äôs mind but is good with decent colours and a wide-angle.The battery life is amazing! It lasts around 8 hours easily with moderate use like web development and some music playing in the background. If you‚Äôre just watching movies or using Google Docs or Word, it should last even longer.One thing to note is that the laptop expiration date is June 2026, which means it will still work just fine, but will not receive any new ChromeOS updates after that. This does not depend on when you‚Äôre buying the laptop, so don‚Äôt expect it to last long if you‚Äôre getting it later in its lifetime.The only two cons I can find here are the lack of a backlit keyboard and a 720p display instead of a 1080p display. But I can‚Äôt complain about it at this price.Overall, it‚Äôs a good laptop for general home usages like watching movies, playing some light games and document processing. You can also do some light programming on this because of the Linux support. If that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôre looking for, I would recommend this over any Windows laptop at this price."

But struggles with heavy mid- heavy workloads . CPU is the limiting factor understandably .OS  is snappy & frequently updated üëçüèº. Screen is average ,not that good  for movies & photo viewing  . Lacks contrast & colour depth .  Wifi stability could be better .Make sure you check the warranty details for computer purchases .I got a device with warranty start date 10 days before purchase .

3,"The Legendary chrome book,  that performs like a 2gb ram, (it's 4gb ram model ), I had to return the first one and since there's no option for refund,  had it replaced by another one,  thanks anyways,  second one same model is working fine but not the 4gb models performance,  updated it to latest version of chrome,  using it as daily driver,  since it's upgrade of my 2gb Acer chrome book which is still doing good,  this one's not up to the mark,  sorry Hp, I wasted 25k on this honestly,  buyers looking for Hp chrome book, Avoid all together!!"

4,"overall the product is good ..thickness is very good......light weight ...and touch screen good....pubg gaming and cod gaming is not that good unless u add some graphic card or etc......the only problem is the display , but for this price range it is the best laptop for a collage students .........basic gaming is very good no lags ....and another problem is miscroft apps are paid apps , u need to buy them to use them......portable laptop......"
5,"I have been using it for 4 months, its my secondary device.pros:1.Good battery life2.Touch is good, better not to use because it is not convertible3.Good keyboard4.HD+ good screen5.simple OS6.Boots in 5 seconds7.Good speakers8.Charges in 1 hour9.Brightness is good10.Updates are frequent.Cons:1.White balance of screen is different in different angles2.No backlit keyboard3.Camera is average4.the processor can handle simple games(like alto's odyssey) from playstore or simultaneously run 6 apps or 25 tabs in chrome over that you will face lag5.laptop is bit heavier."
5,"Okay, as a tech enthusiast, I've been looking for a Chromebook for a while and after doing some research, I narrowed down to this.Firstly, the delivery was the same day, which I didn't want to believe to be fair, but it happenedA few things to keep in mind before you buy a Chromebook in general, is that they are not your windows or Mac devices. Although the functionality of the devices will be limited, these are still quite capable devices.Coming to this particular device, What I love about this:The keyboard is surprisingly better than i was expecting at this price pointIt is a touch screen which I might not use, but will come in handy for most peoplethe trackpad is decentbattery life is greatThere is a bit of a learning curve but you will enjoy the deviceConsThe screen isn't full HDBuild quality is plastic, good plastic, but plastic nonethelessOverall, this Chromebook can be a daily use laptop for many people who are looking for Web Browsing, WFH and Basic task.Please don't expect this Chromebook to run premiere pro or photoshop. And please don't look at things it can't do look at things that it can."
5,"Its a mind blowing purchase , At the very little cost you are getting a great quality product performance is mind blowing looks are mind blowing and if we compare it with the MacBook air it is giving a tough competition to it and chrome OS is mind blowing no lags know and complexity it is very easy to use and you have to think beyond Windows because windows constantly having problem like viruses lags crashing and all less battery back up but it has a battery backup of 12 hours, Believe in my words you would never regret if you have basic expectation With a mobile phone or laptop this is a wonderful device I recommend all an Amazon is wonderful and very helpful"
5,Best laptop under this price range .
4,"These are my first impressions about the productThe Pros is it is lightweight, has a nice touchscreen and a keyboard, so it serves as a laptop and also like a tab, which is very convenient. I found most of the features are helpful and the time it takes to start is very less, compared to the MS os. Charging is good and stays on for much of the time.Con is about the keyboard key placement, no End key or Del key which is very critical for working on Docs and Excel files. for every delete operation, we got to go to the end and press backspace ,which is irritating, also the power key is above the backspace key, and accidentally one can press the power key, which will turn off the laptop.overall it is a decent product for the price range it offers."
5,"Overall good product to buy at this price range. Very much happy and easy to carry. It is good those who looking for normal usage of browsing, YouTube videos, small games with battery üîã backup of more than 12 hours if it is charged full battery.Pros:1. Good design and light weight. Easy to carry.2. Booting Speed less than 5 seconds.3. YouTube ads are default blocked by chrome OS and more convenient to watch YouTube videos like Premium without any charges per month.4. Very Good Battery üîã backup more than 12 hours.5. Browsing and touch screen is nice.6. Fast charging support.7. Price is less 25k budget Chromebook Laptop.Cons:1. Finding difficulty to type and save word document (Ex.,) Resume typing, etc., able to do only using online Google Docs and finds difficulty in Text alignment and copy to local harddrive, but feels not much convenient like Windows OS.2. If I connect my Samsung Galaxy A70 with Type C port, files are showing very slow, and not able to copy to harddrive. Instead of copy via Type C cable, I have copied via ""InShare Android App -> Web Sharing when connected to same WiFi"".3. Bluetooth Connection is failed frequently when we disconnected, we may needs to Reboot Chromebook again for restore connection, feeling very bad for this issue. Since, I am always use Bluetooth Speaker üîä for audio / playback.4. Not all Android apps are supported like mobile phones.5. Only low memory games supported otherwise, you will endup with Screen hanged up while loading the game."
4,"After reading all the reviews, thought of giving it a try and I had mixed feelings. Here are my observations.1. Super Fast. Apps get installed at a sheer pace. Uninstalling hardly takes 2 seconds.2. Touch Screen is very good and responsive.3. HD Ready Screen, not so good. However, at this price, you can't get better. Not sure of ASUS counterpart though.4. Audio Output is average from both earphones and the speakers. Could have been a lot better. At max volume, it's very bad. Gives a rattling type output.5. Camera is just fine. Does the job for normal video calls on Skype & Zoom.6. Microsoft Excel/ Word/ PPT need 365 subscription. However you can edit or work on the above using Google Sheets/Docs/Slides.7. You can set wallpaper on homescreen (From any source, Your files too) as well as Lockscreen (Only from Google Photos)Overall, ""Can Try"" device for this price point."
1,"Bought this in March 2021. Stopped working in a few days.Engineer came and fixed, suggesting issue with battery.In mid July laptop stopped working again. Engineer visited and replaced the motherboard.Then asked to call HP for installing operating system! HP call center after hours of wasting my time asked me to visit service center.Nobody picks calls at the service center. Mumbai has only one, that too at Sakinaka.Service center guy says you need to bring a 32 GB bootable hardisk with software preloaded from HP website."
4,"Chromebook does not allow you to sideload apps from storage.Apps can be installed from official app store only. (workarounds ie development mode is painful)So if you are considering it for use with Byju's app or similar, Pl don't.MS office doesn't work either, so you need to use WPS office or similar.However, that said, as long as you are okay with aforementioned restrictions, this is a wonderful notebook with great battery backup."
5,"Good for students and employees who need laptop for office use like excel, ppt, etc. Not at all recommend for one  who are expertise especially in graphic design, animation, high end games etcc.ProExcellent touchscreenLight weightAttractiveFast100 gb Google cloud for 1 year.Mobile Google to laptop Google synchronisationDis advEMC hardisk that only 64 gbNot for high end users,.Not all android app are working in laptop"
5,This laptop is a perfect chromebook.1. Its battery life is amazing2. Cheap affordable touch screen laptop3. Can easily replace your windows laptop4. Runs almost same like your android phone5. More user-friendly than a windows laptop
1,"No. Don't waste money by taking this labtop, unless it will allow Windows operating system to install. It's just large version of mobile with bigger screen. There is no difference between this labtop & mobile. Unfortunately, I have wasted money by taking this labtop. Even company not provide microsoft office for free."
5,"The product is excellent for office use. 7 hours battery life with light music in the background while working on docs. The battery life is a huge win.Keyboard is excellent! I do a lot of drafting and found the keyboard accurate and comfortable. The touchscreen is a huge plus, I've stopped carrying/using a mouse with me.You can install linux based apps on the chromebook as well. Thereby, the overall value for money is just top notch."
5,Chromebook is better than windows my children loved it but they should give laptop bag also overall very nice
3,"Only for browsing and watching movies, best for student online classes, not at all used for office work. Just like a android tab with keyboard. Windows OS users please make sure to double check before buying there is no return policy, I bought it for office use and now using for kids online classes üòî"
5,"Before you purchase this, decide whether you can make do with a chromebook else you should go for lower end laptop.Performance, Looks and Build Quality are excellent. I was pleasantly surprised with how well it performs given the internals. I'm personally biased towards AMD processors and this time as well AMD did not disappoint.Performance in the converted tablet mode is also good, albeit the 16:9 ratio on a 14 inch screen does require some getting used to. All in all, this was a good decision for my use case."
4,"Hello all, please wait a second and read this review before you make any decision.If you are thinking for a laptop and then buying this then my dear you are at wrong place.This is not a laptop this is basically a TABLET attached with a keyboard that's it."
5,"Almost all functions used in normal laptop can also be used in Chromebook. Simple & Best for home & office use. For this price, value of the product is high.Do not know about gaming capabilities yet.Pros:1) Instant Boot up.2) Instant shut down.3) Touch screen.4) Light weight (1.49 Kgs).5) MS office (For Android) from play store can be used.6) As an easy free alternative - Since Google have almost all applications, suh as Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides etc. we won't feel any limitations when compared to a normal laptop.7) Classic look.8) Have 4 layers of security.Cons:1) Disk storage 64 GB only. But cloud can be used for storage for further."
4,"Looks and feels like a nice laptop, touch works great"
1,As detailed in the specifications there no slot available on the machine for expanding the memory by 256GB.. no feedback yet ! More over they won't publish the feedback even after 3 days! May be till the free replacement period expires ..they won't respond
1,The charger for the laptop is not working and I complained to HP the customer person said he has raised my request as dead on arrival. I should have returned the whole laptop and replaced as I thought the charger is the only problem let me replace only that I got into trouble.its been a month and charger is still coming without any date. My Case ID 5072569874 incase for HP to cross verify.
2,"THERE IS NO 100GB OF FREE CLOUD STORAGE AS SHOWN IN SPECIFICATIONS . Laptop shows not eligible for the service.There is no memory card slot as shown in the specifications, HOW DO WE EXPAND THE STORAGE TO 256 GB ??THE SMART LOCK JUST DOES NOT WORK WITH THE LAPTOPTHE HP SUPPORT SERVICE IS NOT CONTACTABLE .BATTERY DOES NOT GO FOR 9 HOURS.*I WILL WANT A REFUND FOR THIS PRODUCT*"
4,"Just bought one and trying out now.  I will add more details later.  Experience is so far, so good.One important issue though.  How do I claim the free 100GB google drive storage.  I tried to claim it from the perks site through google one but there is 'error from their side.'  Please help first."
3,"Classy product, sleek design, easy to carry. Best for budget.It is not meant for creative works like graphic design, video editing or gaming. You can still do all those, but the UI is not very good. Low RAM doesn't help either. Maybe okay for beginners who are worried about expense.Best for: StudentsUseful for office works.Battery life is good so far. Heats up a little, but that's expected if your network is poor or if you run applications that require high performance. Poor camera quality. Screen quality is just okay.If you're here looking for a chromebook (that means you accept that it is limited to certain features and completely depends on network) then you can consider buying this.I would suggest buying a screen protector along with it.Edited: I suggest looking for other Chromebooks and keep this as a last resort. There are better options  for the same price."
4,"Overall i would say if your ok with an average/sub-par display then this will not disappoint you !! it's extremely portable and easy to use for students/elders - does all the usual stuff like browsing, going through apps, web calls etc. It's not for hardcore work (coding/video editing, number crunching using ms office / high end windows softwares)Pros- Compact form factor.- Decent Built Quality, it's plastic but does not feel cheap.- Awesome battery life (10-13 hrs), mostly performs better than my phone and windows laptop.- Fast Charging (45 mins, 0 to100%), 45W Charger which is USB type C, and not like the usual bulky laptop chargers.- Specs are decent enough to support the OS, Apps and all rest of the functionality, the laptop is quick to load and takes almost everything u throw at it without really stuttering.- I think it's far better than a tab with the option of working as a full laptop and convertible to a tab which can do landscape/portrait modes like a charm.- Awesome backlit keyboard, feels way better than most of the windows ones in this price, also they keyboard gets disabled when rotated so no issues on keys getting pressed while in tab mode.- Liked the color options on this - it's matt finish and looks more expensive than it's price !Cons- Was very disappointed with the display, it's below average (extremely bad viewing angles, it's not an FHD screen). I do not think the display is justified at this price range (31K). This for me was the biggest con - and  honestly i am even thinking of returning it just for this one issue, we need to keep changing the angles in sunlight while in tab mode to read a news paper/article.- May be i have not figured this one yet, but when in tab mode if it goes idle - it does not come back on unless bought into laptop mode.- Speakers are below average, they are loud - but not clear (again thy could do better at this price)"
3,Pros :1. Touch Screen2. Speakers are good3. This laptop is only useful for kids because of crome OS4. Fast Opening and closing.Cons :1. Some of the apps like Hotstar not works perfectly crashes all the time.2. Storage is very less.3. Not all apps are available for chrome OS.4. Just a Tablet with keyboard not more than of that5. It's very heavy so no use of 360¬∞ rotation.
4,Its good for students who do only classes...its just a big browser..like a big tab...but in this price its a good buy...again strictly would work excellent for students for online classes..
5,Amazing laptopBattery life once fully charged worked for the whole day.Touch is also good.Speakers are very good volume is loud and clear.Camera is ok ok.Keyboard is awesomeOver all best option in this range if you want both laptop and tablet. The flip is also good.It is a must buy.
5,"Loved the product, first time user of chrome book, must confess, looks impressive, at this price 27k) it's a steal!"
5,Without thinking go for it
3,"Good for those who wrok mostly on internet, storage is an issue, 100gb cloud storage is bluff, but great for study purpose watching movies and all( you will have to adjust your screen for best viewing angle)"
1,"No slot for micro SD , though company claim of 256 gb micro SD card expandable. So any one want for add memory ,it's not possible. Also no fingerprint reader in device."
5,Value for money  for day to day basis usage no sd card slot . Battery life is best brightNess  also light weight very comfortable usage .
1,It does not have sd  card slot and it‚Äôs battery is local and it‚Äôs does working properly hanging app doesn‚Äôt work
3,build quality is good. worst screen on laptop in history of laptop screens. battery is long lasting.
5,Thing important to know is that first understand your needs then buy this laptop. It's good and does what it says.
1,"Purchased laptop from Amazon on 3rd oct, noticed the warrant slip serial is not matching with laptop serial, complaint raised to Amazon, 15 days over even now the warrant slip serial is not changed. Now i purchased extended warranty along with this, i have booked the extended warranty based on the warrant slip serial. Now i have paid addtional 3,500 rs extra for some one laptop."
5,"Great deal at this price. Ryzen 3 processor is good enough to deal multitasking and running editing softwares. Got a free windows 11 upgrade which made it more fast and smooth. SSD makes it boot very quickly. The only drawback is RAM availability, only 6 gb is available out of 8, 2 gb is reserved for gpu."
5,"This laptop is awesome for students and teachers as it comes with subscription of MS Office. The screen and sound quality is very good. Battery backup is also great, the battery lasts for almost 5 hours. In battery settings, kept battery to its better performance, if we keep it at the best performance, battery drains out fast."
1,"The laptop received was defective. It never started without putting it into charging. everytime it started, the screen always remained black, the keyboard lit up and the fan's noise was audible too, but the display never turned on Amazon support was touchwood useless. They kept on postponing the inspection by a week and today the service got completed on its own. I am not even aware of how. Now i cannot return/replace it because a week has already passed."
5,"This is a nice laptop with sufficient processing capabilities at such a low price point.I bought this laptop for Just 27K, and things that this laptop has are mind-blowing.Office Home & student with lifetime license.Windows 10 home.Ryzen CpuVega Graphics7+ hours of battery backup.An empty slot for RAM.I'm going to upgrade the RAM to 16GB and replace the hard drive with an SSD and the system will easily become my secondary driver.The only things that I'll miss are:1) Full HD screen resolution2) 8-bit (16.7M colors) display (this one is 6 bit(252K colors) only)3) Backlit keyboard.Update:I have upgraded both RAM and Storage. Now the system is super smooth like butter on hot Chapati.I am a little upset though. Not with the laptop but with HP. They never mentioned it has an m.2 slot anywhere in the Amazon or on their website. I could have got an m.2 drive and kept the 1TB hard drive as well."
3,"while opening MS office and signing i got a message thatYou can use office until 29th May 2020. After that date, most features of office will be disabled.Now what does this mean. I was told that laptop come with MS office as part of the package.I need help from HP support services."
2,Not expecting such a low level of product form HPThere are few things which will help buyer's before they buy this laptop:1. Battery - very poor2. Keyboards - poor3. Graphics - poor4. Price - should be less than 32K5. 2 star is only because this laptop works6. Its keep updating all software till 5th day after starting.7. Hangs vey often8. Only for kids online classes.Buy this laptop only if you don't have any other options....
1,Don't you ever buy this laptop! Never!Slowest laptop ever!! It takes atleast 5min to open and then lags .. it takes forever to open browsers! .. do you still have a reason to buy this one?
5,"Bought at 26990. Price fluctuates every 3-4 days. Best processor with Win10 and MSOffice. Cheapest with this combo. The box and laptop comes with MS Office sticker which is essential to seek help for Office download, installation and activation. It doesnt come with stock MSO HS2019 and it keeps on showing MSO365. I approached HP helpdesk using whatsapp and got it done in 2hrs flat. Excellent HP support. They will guide you how to get MSO 2019HS. Its better you do it after first OS update. HP Support whats app number is on sticker. Value for Money"
1,"Please people, don't go with this product if you want the performance. This laptop is super slow, may be because of processor. If you just want to watch movies and browse internet for basic purpose you can buy. But if your expectations are high like gaming, programming or heavily browsing internet with 10 tabs open at same time. Please  don't buy this particular product.Please mind, this review is about the product, not about Amazon. Amazon delivery process and everything else was without complaint. Thanks, hope this helps a few."
4,Awesome if u want to purchase it for home and student purposes. The speed is good and colour enhance it's beauty. I recommend it for home purpose user and student user. For gaming purpose use other high tech laptops not below 35 thousand. For this rate it is best.
1,"Message is most often displayed as ""Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.We're just collecting some error info, and then you can restart"" And then Computer restarts automatically.In this regard,amazon's representative was contacted but linked with HP's virtual support by amazon's representative and further no feedback was sought from amazon's representative.As such,replacement is needed from amazon.in."
1,I expected this product to be a brand new product cause it didn't say renewed. I bought this a a gift for a friend's daughter. But due to some delete mishaps had to retrieve some of its data.  I was so ashamed to see all sorts of immoral pictures and videos in its history.  It is really a shame that I that girl had to go thru such a shameful situation. I have been shopping with Amason for so long and I was ashamed very badly
5,"The laptop is made of excellent plastic material and has a textured matte finish and is mostly non-slippery. It has a good built.Screen is typically nice and colours are reproduced well. It is not FHD which is not a bad thing at that price.Ryzen 3 (3200U) is a processor which is better than an Intel i3 8th gen processor, but not as good as the latest 10th gen. It is capable of most basic tasks like browsing, using office, doing most common school and home type works, online classes, watching movies, etc. It will struggle a bit if you try to open very large office files of 100MB or more work like image or video processing or gaming, but for most home use cases, its more than enough.It comes with a built in 4GB RAM, which should be enough for most users (but if you upgrade it to 8GB, it will be amazing). It also has a 1TB HDD which is more than enough to store all files.The mouse trackpad support multi finger gestures and smooth scrolling. It has two prominent separate hardware buttons. Keyboard is good with keys having a good play, but are not backlit.Ports: 3 USB, 1 HDMI, 1 USB-C, 1 SD card reader.This comes with preinstalled genuine Windows 10 Home as well as Microsoft Office 2019 Home&Student (Word, Ppt, Excel, OneNote only). Should be enough for most users.It has a 41Wh battery which should last 3+ hrs easily for most users.Remember that this is an entry level laptop for 29k. Its not a 40k laptop. So do not expect high performance levels. Its for basic usage.Ideal for: Young kids (no hardcore gaming), online classes, simple home usage.Not for: Gamers, Heavy office usage, Photoshop or video editing.Build quality: ExcellentTips: I bought an additional 2yr Extended warranty HP Care Pack for less than 3k. It also comes with McAfee LiveSafe 30-day free trial offer, but that is the first thing you should uninstall and let Windows Defender do its job."
5,"I got this Laptop today. I wanted a simple laptop for online claseses, MS office and browsing. I am not a tech savvy person but I could install and activated the laptop in 30 minutes and faced no problem. I has come with McAfee antivirus 1 month trial pack. I hope it will give good service. Keeping my fingers crossedAmazon delivered within 2 days and packaging was also good."
2,"It should be labelled as kids laptop. Good that I bought it for my child, where only 1 or 2 apps are required.AMD is struggling even after decades to make a CPU that can delight.With only Internet explorer (3 tabs) and Microsoft Teams (no ongoing call). CPU is touching 89% Memory 93% and Disk 97%. Yes a brand new laptop with zero data and apps added (except Teams).Please dont buy with any great expectations, but I guess ok for online schooling (keeping fingers crossed)."
1,"Even the laptop is Brand New, there is Lot of Lag .. cant even open a simple word document.. More Over you cannot Return this Order even on very next day, Returning is not possible... BEWARE !!!!! RETURN OF THE PRODUCT IS NOT POSSIBLE"
4,Product is working flawlessly after upgrading to M2 Sata3 ssd and 8GB Ram. Some game also performs well. No heating issues. Battery life average. Office Home and Student 2019 is free. It has and additional M.2 Sata3 drive which was mentioned no where and I have confirmed through Hp community website.
1,"Laptop had problems from the beginning. All browsers crash- Chrome, MS Edge, Opera, MoziIlla. Very poor product support from HP. We had atleast 6-7 interactive sessions on line. But problem remains the same. Manu soft attempts were Made through phonecall but no solution. H / W was checked and they said it's OS issue, reload. All done but till.now the problem remains. Very dissatisfied and disappointed with HP and their product support"
1,"This purchase turned out to be a nightmare. Not only did the laptop's screen turned pitch black in a week, but after a HP service, the camera stopped working. Do not buy this. Don't know if it's HP or the seller, E-Trade online... But both are at fault. The purchase wasted so much of our time and effort. Buy any other laptop and choose a different seller!"
1,"Its not at all worth it to purchase , very slow processing since i purchased this product . And  now touchpad stop working . Its complete waste of money . Please it to return procedure and now I want my money back as soon as possible else I will raise it to consumer forum."
4,"It is a basic laptop, suitable for students, home use or simple office work. Build quality is great and it seems it will last long. Display and battery backup are best in the class but keypad feels cheap. If you are looking for a performance laptop for gaming, complex graphic work etc you should look at those costing 35k and more."
4,Decent for a price. Carefull with the keys on keyboard......mine broke of and now no fixing it4gb ram is not enough so install additional 4gb or 8gb stick.  2 ram slots 1 is soldered with 4gb 2400.....crushal ram sticks of 2600 ddr4 works at 2400. I installed 4 gb one....it also includes m.2 SSD slot
3,"One of the key reasons that I brought this laptop was for Videoconferencing and online Zoom sessions. Only upon 1st usage did I realize that the quality of the Camera is 'Not' upto the mark. Highly pixelated and blurr version of yourself comes up on screen in all video calls.System performance is TOO SLOW  as well. The 4GB RAM literally takes about a minute to open each and every window - that too in a brand new laptop, imagine!!I have requested IMMEDIATE RETURN of the LAPTOP!!"
1,"Worst Laptop, just a waste of time and money. so sluggish and hp services are the worst. I can't even open  2 pages simultaneously, it's taking forever .....when I contacted hp services they are just wasting time with useless steps, please don't buy this product even some of the reviews I read before buying but for me it's not working."
5,"There are many confusing reviews from one to five stars. For an average user this is as good as any other laptop especially at this price point. No, there is no lag in booting nor does it hang. Connects to hotspot and Bluetooth easily.PS: no idea about gaming or making complicated graphics. For the rest nothing negative"
4,"It is a good laptop, but has been sabotaged due to low 4 GB Ram. Due to this it has become extremely sluggish. Not recommended in this configuration.I have added 8 GB Ram and now it is working OK.  But it further needs SSD to speed up. Luckily it has M.2 slot and I want to get 500 GB SSD.Otherwise the laptop is quite good."
4,Looks good and working fine as expected.
3,"I purchased it in May 2020 and just received it post lockdown. It took ages to turn on the system. Minimum 5mins, basically RAM could not handle Windows 10 and with a slow HDD. Teams was very unstable on it. I would says problem of teams is more to do with Microsoft not the laptop. But yes I faced too much of difficulty in using teams. Later after some research I found Ssd could help so I upgraded to KINGSTON A2000 and an additional 4gb ram stick. I did it my self. After that the systems performance increased dramatically. Boot in 15secs. But teams problem continued for months, but teams has stabilised recently. So only buy RYZEN with SSD & 8 Gb RAM. HP support is good."
1,I bought this laptop not even a month and it display is gone and not booting.Service Centre is also not attending after complaint.Never buy this product and mostly online.
3,"Bought this and the returned as did not suit the needs.. quite slow performance due to sata hdd and 4 gb RAM but biggest drawback not compatible to 5g wifi. Nowhere mentioned in the description. However at this price there is no way to get better RAM and harddisk , but expected 5g compatibility.Happy with the seller comp store who delivered, very much on time and accepted my return. Also the price quoted by the seller was cheapest among anywhere else for this laptop, bought it for 28800"
1,Not worth at all for the price.Doesnt even run chrome without lagging like Hell.Not recommended even for 1st grade student.It just doesnt work.
1,"I purchased this after going through several of the satisfactory reviews. This is a budget laptop and though the screen, battery, weight aspect is good, the processor rayzen 3 is not as good as it was vouched by many. The laptop is pathetically slow and even though it dosen't burn hole in your pocket i am disappointed with the product. Laptop buyers need to upgrade the ram to get satisfactory speed."
5,A good very product with good features . It is light in weight and easy to use. It is very ideal for normal (low to medium load) home/official work and its performance is very smooth under normal load/usage.It is certainly a value-for-money product and comes at an affordable price. All the features provided were as mentioned on amazon. It is recommended for normal home/office usage and may not be suitable for playinggames with high graphics or heavy workloads.
1,"I would highly not recommend this laptop, it worthless and waste of money. I'm regretting buying this"
1,Video Player is loading.
1,"The Speed is So Slow That you just can not work properly.its is really a wastage of money..""u will just keep on clicking but ,response of every window is extremely slow""I purchased it as a budgeted laptop, but I regret it every time I use it.""ryzen 3 is of no use""still if HP is ready to exchange the same , I am ready to pay extra bucks."
1,2nd hand Product Received.Very Cheap thing.Didn't expect such type of thing from Amazon.It was my all time favourite online shoping app For Shopping.But now they brockTheir trust nd loyalty.Now i m forcing everyone to avoid amazon shopping site.
1,Pathetic product from HP...dead slow speed..turns dead while shifting from one screen to another..hangs time n again..boot time takes min 5-7 minutes..not worth..a laptop can't be slower than this...very very disappointing experience..no one shud buy this configuration product..
4,"Day 3 use review - Absolutely value for money. Machine was slightly laggy during startup and initial setup. Did a few routine tasks, nothing heavy duty. Post all updates, the lag seems to have subsided, battery backup is good too. On the downside - the Alt key on the right doesn't seem to function. Not gonna make a big deal out of it."
1,"It is a known fact that companies are making cheap, downgraded versions of laptops for ecommerce market places.This is a classic example of one of those.Please please dont waste your time and money on this one.Invest a little more and buy a sturdier and better machine. This is a box of junk."
1,Won't prefer HP anymore. worst Customer care service. You are lucky enough if it have no complaints. Hp have pathetic customer care system.Also the price is increasing as per sellers wish.. Totally it was one of the worst purchase for me
1,"It's a worst laptop I've ever seen.I had bought this for my brother but it's totally waste of money. Laptop is very very very slow. Even I'm not able to open a browser and excel.Dear HP, Please take back your laptop and return my money because we are not using it after we bought it. There was no exchange/replacement options as well.Dear Amazon, please help us. If we would have bought from local market then we would have got a better laptop in the same price. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª"
4,"If you are looking for budget laptop doing all your personal work along with office work during this pandemic, you can go for it.cons are:screen quality is not so high.Laptop might be slow if you are working on IDE, I do understand as it has only 4 gb RAM. Maybe, upgrading ram will resolve this issue. I will update on the same."
1,"Specifications is different of the product, it mentions that storage is one terabyte,but where as its220 gb, and 4 Gb Ram it is,where it should be 8 gb,absolute waste of time and money"
4,Specifications are same as mentioned in website. You will love it's slim and compact design. Model number Vostro 3000 not 3400.Intial booting was slow after driver updation and setup now it s normal.Windows 10 & Ms-Office inbuilt.You need to uninstall additional McAfee antivirus. Many people are complaining about slow booting. McAfee is not require. Windows 10 is having by default virus protection.Let's see how will it run further. this is my first review after opening the packet.
1,"Dont Buy this product at all. Worst product.Hanging issues, heating issues from day of purchase. Cant even use a single web browser properly."
4,"Been using Vostro for a week. While there were a lot of anxiety after looking at the latest reviews, the experience has been amazing. The battery life can do better and there is overheating during gaming, but overall a wonderful experience."
4,"It is good Anti-glare laptop for online classes.Pros:1. Good configuration in this price2. Windows 10 is a plus pointCons:1. It should have SSD, as it takes longer booting time2. Unnecessary extra space below the sreen"
1,We bought this laptop considering the fact that it has i3 Processor and 8GB inbuilt RAM thus making the system faster. But in reality this is worst laptop I ever used in past 20 years. This laptop hangs randomly and takes a lot of time (some times more than 2 mins) to respond. Sometimes it does not respond and needs to be forcibly rebooted. With time its becoming worse. Do not buy this.
1,"Very worst performance eventhough the configuration is good .  Please don't buy this... Just delivered today and started using without even anyother software installed... But it takes time to open the browser and if we type 5 letters and wait, then it appears.  Very worst performance... I am returing today itself .."
5,"Before I purchase i read all reviews but I purchased same laptop.  For this budget the performance and look is good. Rs.37500 only, today its delivered. keyboard back light is not available, size little big but Weightless."
1,this is the slowest laptop i ever used. Right from the windows boot up.I cant believe i3 11 gen processor is slower than my i3 3rd gen.Even opening the browser is taking time.Have reset the windows twice and the same issue is there. Dont know what to do this useless machine.
5,"Contrary to reviews about slow startup and all, i found this laptop quick and responsive. I have an 8gb version and even without SSD it is responding well. The key is to apply available windows updates and allow McAfee version provided to speed up your machine."
1,Never buy laptops by online please üôè. Just it's been one month after i purchased this laptop.now suddenly display lost it's complete brightness without any physical damage to it. And it's difficult to find dell service center near by for claiming its warranty as it's seems to be repaired by service center for its hardware damage.
1,"It's a piece of plastic trash made by Dell. Not worth at all. Lags on booting due to HDD and insufficient RAM. This machine needs Nvme SSD + 16 GB RAM for smooth run. Built quality also not upto mark, see Dell's previous models of Latitude Series having super build quality."
1,Had to spend 6k on SSD to make it work.Lost the Office setup due to new SSD install.In Ubuntu audio drivers have issues.Cannot connect wide screen external monitor. Motherboard does not support.
1,"Dell Vostro 3401 14 inch (35.5 cm) FHD Display Laptop (11th Gen i3-1115G4 / 8GB / 1TB HDD / Inte  Windows system process is very slow ,please its change . And reply immediately to Mr Rajaram subudhi mail id:"
5,Reasonably fast and affordable. Works well for all the usual requirements. Good for programming and running mid level heavy software. Quality is top notch from Dell
1,"Touch mouse is not working, system getting restart automatically technician visit getting reschedule duplicate product...  better to buy from respective store rather Amazon..."
2,"The dell vostro I bought is very laggy,  very slow in responding, screen time to initiate is also very long , most of the time gets hanged, need to wait for long hours, worst product I bought. Loss of money ..."
1,I purchased same product but it's real spec was 4gb and 220 gb.. Worst experience
1,Very slow to boot... Occasionally having problem with audio jack for headphones.... Not feeling satisfied with the money paid
3,I got 8GB RAM & 1TB HDD machine but its very slow. Better to go SSD version.
5,Good budget laptop. Not too much slow as mention in review .it is HDD and not compare it to SSD laptop. Good processing and configuration with Dell platform.
1,Laptop is very slow. Booting up and making application starts will take more than 10 minutes.Not recommended at all.
5,Product found defective after verifying the Amazon Technical Support Team but also thankfull Amazon Technical Support Team to arrange a replacement of this product
4,Nice packaging by Amazon. product is nicely working.when I received the package and open the laptop is not working but I plugged the charger in. then laptop become switch on.
3,"Nice product (look, feel and weight) but even 8 Gb version is very slow. Also, it's a bit tedious to get office activated."
5,"Item is fine, if you are looking any compact size laptop then its a best thing for you. You may add 8gb ram which will improve experience and make it a smooth."
3,Very slow booting speed
5,Computer is good but not able to activate Office
2,Procdut is not worth don't buy any oneSpeed is slow and battery backup is not good also. It's brand only nothing. I think amezon is selling refurbished product.
5,Very good product. Compact structure.
3,Good Quality Products from Dell
3,"Laptop is bit slow considering its  configuration, it has 8 GB memory and core i3"
5,nice product
4,Laptop is so so good.Keys are fine for light userNo power LED this is bit shocking
1,Today received Vostro laptop. But same is not in working condition..some issues. Pl ask Dell team to resolve urgently
4,Nice.. üëç
2,No battery backup till 6 hour as mention in the description. Yet to know more
3,Cheap look
1,Laptop runs very slow worst product need to replace kindly suggest
1,Bad product bad service from amazon
4,"It is faster and more responsive than any other laptop I have worked on.Why 4 stars? Because when I started using it, it killed my WiFi Router every time I tried to connect to the internet. All the devices connected to that router would loose internet connection if I connected this laptop.Extensive research on the internet revealed that the Windows based pre-installed Lenovo apps like Lenovo Vantage may be responsible for the issue.I uninstalled all pre-installed Lenovo apps and the issue is now resolved. Posting this in the hope that it may help others."
5,"This is a laptop that I purchased after extensive research and hundreds of hours of watching YT reviews on the latest laptops. I wanted something that was future proof for at least the next 7 years but light on my pocket.I did not want fancy good looking thin and light laptops with fancy features like windows hello face recognition, 24-hour battery life, Thunderbolt 4. These are good features to have but I did not want them on my laptop. The main purpose of this laptop was school work, light programming, consuming entertainment and seamless web browsing. Particularly, I wanted the office applications to open quickly and get work done soon, instead of waiting for them to load forever.This laptop delivered everything I wanted. It is a no-nonsense laptop. Performs exactly as I expected. The application opening is snappy. The response times for web browsing are super crisp. Installations take barely any time. The web download and upload speeds are impressive. Some pros and cons for your consideration below.Pros:-Built like a tank, sturdy, no flex on screen, the body is hard with minimal keyboard flex-Typing experience is good with good keys layout, awesome special keys at the top row-Trackpad is large enough and very responsive, buttery smooth pinch-zoom just like a mac-Screen is large with barely any bezels (just about 1 cm chin)-The top lid is metal and feels premium (attracts fingerprints though)-Processor and ram performance are on point-The wifi connection stability is consistent and has high speed-Applications open swiftly and boot time is within 7 seconds-Fingerprint sensor has <1 second response time (the best I have seen)-Hinge is plastic but sturdy and it will last long-Screen brightness is good, suited for my purpose-Seamless integration into a wireless display-Lenovo vantage software keeps things updated and allows easy management of the laptop-MS office setup was easy-McAfee Full version cost just 299 extra-Type C USB port for display or power deliveryCons-Webcam is poor (you may want to use an external camera, no windows hello face recognition)-Screen resolution could have been better-Sound is loud but has a tin like quality as if coming from a hollow. The sound is sufficient for casual use/online class but you may want to use a earphone anyways-Slightly heavier (can lift with one hand), probably due to the build quality-Botton cover is plastic (but a high-quality one with no plasticky feeling), feels rubberised surface-No dedicated GPU like MX450 in this model (other variations of this laptop have GPU but they do not have 16GB ram)-Battery lasts for 7 hours or less on regular surfing (a 70Whr battery would have been nicer instead of the 57 Whr)-Charger is small but the conventional type. Instead, I would have liked a single brick USB type C charger (like the mac).Final recommendation: This is the laptop for everyday use for everyone, where you don't have to worry about being careful with it (like a mac). It will take care of you. The Cons mentioned above are minor quibbles from a perfectionist but to be balanced in my review I had to point them out.Get work done without the distraction of fancy features. Will recommend this laptop for price-conscious power users who just want some peace of mind with their laptop and work. Get the three years warranty for extra peace."
4,"I have purchased it for 77K. Specifications are good like 512GB SSD,16 GB RAM,8GB graphics card, i7 11th generation laptop under this price is good. Power backup is good for 7 hours ofdaily use not for gamers. This is the review of 3 months of use.I haven't get any WiFi connectivity issues for first 3 weeks later WiFi connectivity issues are started.Freuently disconnecting the WiFi. Also frequently refreshing the browser and desktop. System is getting restarted frequently,so I have reset the OS after that it is working as expected so rating has icreased from 3 to 4. Speakers are working fine, sound quality is fabulous.Display is also good.I will strongly recommend this laptop for every one including gamers.I will edit this review frequently to help others."
3,"Guys they said office 2019 is available and pre installed. I found it that 365 trial version is installed and it ask for paid activation as per MS policy. There is complete mismatch. I tried to call lenovo care they asked me uninstall this 365 trial and gave some link to download the 2019 office. I did that and created new MS email account but still it is not activating.Laptop is good ..some missing things that the mouse has only one set of right and left key, it is fast and booting also quickly.PS worked with Lenovo premium support and raised rickets now office activated. Got Win 11"
4,"The overall laptop is good and working smoothPros:The fingerprint sensor is awesomeBattery backup is as decent, While doing development on vscode I found it near where 5-6 hours.screen brightness is good and keyboard backlit comes with 2 mode of lightsSlim easy to carryPerfomance is excellent no lag so farDoing development on vs code working on multiple tabs and also other software are running parralelyCons:Charger gets heated after 1 hourKeyboard is little conjusted as it is 15inch laptop and not 15.6 inchCamera quality is not up to the markbody is ok okIf u want to take laptop for professional use u can definitely go for it.This is the best choice"
5,"Performance is good for office and personal usage.However Hard-disk space is just 512GB.I used multiple Virtual Machines, and that was smooth.Games with very high graphics requirements has significant lag. I tried to play Call of Duty, but it was not as smooth as expected."
5,"Feature loaded for Business Purpose. Used for a week now and all laptop system is fine till date. Activation of MS office was also smooth. Getting use to new keyboard will take some time. I feel Window Pro option, should also be available, even if Lenovo might charge a small premium for the same. Laptop boots really fast due to SSD and all applications opens promptly as compared to my old dell i7 laptop. New laptop means good battery life, but need to see how it performs after couple of years of use."
4,"Namaste, dear Sir/Ma‚ÄôamI have happily purchased a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 Laptop from you. Unfortunately after transferring the data from an old laptop, i found that the capacity of storage on this laptop is 512GB SSD only and excluding the expected 1TB HDD.512 GB SSD is not enough of a storage capacity for my use.Also, Initially I was looking for i7 Processor and this Laptop is i5.Therefore, if possible, I would like to exchange with another laptop that you offer and, of course, pay for the difference in price.The Laptop and Specs i look for are:CPU - i7 ProcessorStorage - 1TB HDD + 500 GB SSDRAM - 16GBSize - 15.6‚ÄùKind regards and  thanks you for your help."
5,It is fast and works perfectly fine.Little bit heavy to my liking though.
5,"Sharing views after 1 week of laptop usage.Pros:1. Intel i5/16 GB RAM with shared IRIS graphics in just Rs. 60k.2. Privacy shutter for cam.3. Sturdy body with good elevation for ventilation.4. Full access to MS Office 2019 home/student edition and free upgrade to Windows 11.5. No bloatware that slowdown PC.6. Lenovo Vantage point to control some BIOS features from Windows.Cons:1. Only 2 USBs ports, as I am used to having 3 USB ports in my old Dell laptop.2. Screen brightness control is very limited. Either it is too bright or too dark and not getting proper setting."
2,It took me one month to get my laptop working to my requirement.. the laptop comes with only student n home MS office so outlook and other apps needed for business is to be bought and it is expensive.. secondly not many Lenovo shops to help configure the laptop everyone in and around services out of warranty laptops only.. it's a huge draw back.. I wish u had choosen Dell instead..
2,"You can buy the same for better price directly in lenovo site than here. Was mentioned as Limited time deal but later realised the price is cheaper in Lenovo site and Tatacliq.In Lenovo the 2021 model of same specification is much cheaper.With 1mp camera, the video quality is very poor. Didn't expect such thing from Amazon where mentioned as Limited Time Deal and price is still comparatively higher."
5,"Got this power-packed laptop with i7-11th Gen under the hood. 16 GB RAM and SSD has really added to the performance. Would definitely recommend to anyone whose a developer, business person, student or someone whose just looking to have a smooth day to day experience working on a laptop."
1,"WiFi connectivity issues are started.Frequently disconnecting the WiFi. Also frequently refreshing the browser and desktop. Unable to upgrade to win11 because of wifi connection. Tried the mentioned solution steps (restarted router, rested the pc, updated the drivers) in lenovo page for thus issue still no luck. Not at all worth buying this laptop.Seeking for help from amazon technician no one has turned up for this."
5,"Nice product,Best Performance Laptop Even tested The graphics is awesome and ssd is there so no issues in Speed.Loving ittttttt.."
4,This product is good build quality and looks premium. I have purchased 16gb RAM and 512 gb SSD (device has 475GB only not 512GB) in that free storage is ~440GB . But sometimes perfomance is getting slow in normal usage only. Sound quality and display good.
5,light for office use and fast for gaming ideal laptop.
5,i love the laptop and the perfomance it does is just awesome and another interestihing is it has windows 11 for free and just looking great the intel i5 processor does the job for you just forget the negative comments and go for it  only one thing it does not have face unlock may be for this price range tthis is little minus point
5,This laptop was amazing and good performance and good battery backup overall performance was good..Recommended to students price range between 70k-80k
4,There might be a problem with the screen or the driver. All of a sudden the text on the screen starts to shake. This has happened twice now. Also the screen goes black some times when the popped up window in Edge takes time to load.
2,Overall Product... upgraded windows 11 and faced flickering issues and resolved by Levono
1,"In the description and with the model, finger print reader included. While setting up, it says no biometric hardware found. Please suggest."
4,overall its good laptop.Its little heavy but good laptop.
5,This product justifies its value. I am using it for development purpose and performance is really good.
1,Keyboard not working properly
1,Dislike
5,Fast and good looks. Feedback after the initial usage is very good.
4,"Wide screen laptop with good specs, good value for money."
5,Been extremely good experience so far. I am enjoying it.
5,Not up to the mark
5,Great product.
5,Nice one
5,I purchased this product a week ago.Processor speed is very quick and smooth gaming at an moderate settingsOnly 8 seconds to open ur windows after shutdown this was an awesome speed bcoz windows installed on SSDTotally performance is very quick and smooth with AMD hexacore.....
1,Damaged screen hinge and a loose screw from the back panel rigjt out of the box !...did not even bother to turn it on ...will return it as soon as possible.
4,"Just received the laptop few days back. The packing wasn‚Äôt secure enough so that laptop box was wobbling inside. I suggest seller puts in more cushioning material to avoid any damage to laptop. The laptop takes a little longer to boot and to shut down despite SSD. The plastic used for  main body is good. The laptop is running well so far. The battery lasts  from 3 to 4 hours depending on what you are doing on it. The keyboard layout is far better than that of HP but can‚Äôt understand why num keys are there on a gaming laptop. Overall a good laptop. Wish it came in an aluminium body since laptop costs a good 67kAfter a few days of installing some games, i have noticed the laptop making lots of sound. Thats a big negative.Edit:- Have updated windows 10 to latest version. Boot and shutdown times have reduced to few seconds.Fans make a lot of noise when laptop is kept on ‚ÄúLap‚Äù but no such issues when kept on a ventilated table....."
5,"Using it for quite some time now..after usage of 4 months of heavy gaming...i have completed death stranding, doom eternal, titanfall 2, subnautica...currently playing sekiro..also i am playing long hours of apex legends everyday...it handles games pretty good..display is a drawback with only 60hz display..but i feel its very good for single player games.where u want challenge and enjoy story...laptop is superfast..till now no issues at all with the laptop..must buy if you want a power packed laptop in budget."
5,Best laptop in this price range. Performance is great and its build quality is impressove.
5,"The laptop is very good with a battery life of nearly 4-5 hours in day to day usage.It heats a lot during high performance usage, so keep it on a stand or in an area where it gets clear circulation. The dual fans are good.My prime concern is that the heat dissipation is via the screen - only time will tell what impact this has.Overall I am happy with the product. If you are buying it, please spend the extra money and get the one with the SSD. It is worth it."
4,"Best gaming laptop under budget. processor, battery life, display is good web cam is poor, comes with win 10 home, MS office 365 is trial version,,"
5,Awesome
1,Black dots on screen with in purchase of 4 months onlyHow to replace the LCD SCREENWARRANTY HAVE AND WE'RE to contact
5,Best laptop .Just go for it.Its worth buying.Its all features are excellent.......
4,"hi, friends here I am giving my review after one month of use. I will talk about processor AMD Ryzen 5 4600H with DDR4, Windows start within 10 seconds as OS on SSD.Nice smooth Keyboard. Overall the best Laptop at this price."
4,Mostly using for rendering and graphics
4,"Product is good. High performance with fast speed but battery backup is very poor. After 100% charging, Battery lasts only for 3 hours."
4,Good laptop from lenovo. Value for money
2,Only disadvantage is it has only blue backlight on keyboard and does not support RGB.Its a perfect machine in this range.Battery backup is low
5,Best laptop
3,pls update gst bill in gst portal
5,Love the performance and thermals...
1,"I bought this laptop recently and am having a hard time using the same.This laptop has some serious limitations:1. The Screen is HAZY and BLURRED at places. The TEXT is not clearly readable and causes eye strains, making it unusable for any basic usage also. I have tried updating the Graphics card driver and changing settings, but nothing works !!2. Screen has SERIOUS BLEEDING on edges when background is dark. And Lenovo customer care calls this as their DESIGN !!3. When scrolling the windows start menu items, they are blurred while scrolling and take seconds to render. Even my 10 year old HP Laptop is better than it at this.To top it all, Lenovo CUSTOMER CARE is PATHETIC. They are not ready to even consider this a problem and send an engineer for onsite visit even though I bought a Premium care support.My recommendation, dont buy this CHINESE Product !! Don't make the same MISTAKE I made !!"
4,The battery life just comes for max to max 3to4 hrs without playing on it.It is not as they had mentioned for 6 hrs
4,The upper part of the body looks goods but the lower part is not appealing. Found the display to be very nice. A good laptop overall.
1,"Taskbar gets hanged, poor camera quality and poor lenovo service even being in 2 year warranty as there remote access diagnosis is useless as it cannot solve any issue."
3,Display good but battery below average guysFor this price range so so laptop
1,Display problem started on 8th day of purchase...
2,Cannot locate pre-loaded MS office. Was very difficult even to start up.
4,"Rating this product after 2 days of usage. Just for normal usage, You can go for it without any doubt."
5,Meets my expectations
5,Very nice product thanks Amazon
5,good product and good rate
3,We want to go for 8GB RAM instead of 4GB ram speed
5,Good product
1,"Laptop üíªgot dead within a year that with very nominal usage only for e-mail checking and on line school class that's it.Service center confirmed its motherboard issue...they didn't attend service after having product under warranty that too onsite visit...even giving excuses over phone one after another.Importantly, they asked lots of queries If customer buy product online from Amazon etc...even don't recognise online issued valid invoices on registered products. Keep your boxes intact to give proof of your product purchase in case purchase online."
5,Very Good product for this price range. 35650Boots within 10 seconds.Never lags. Battery life is also good. Gets 4-5 hours backup.Camera is poor but i rarely use it.256 GB is also seems less but its ssd which is superfast. I had 650gb hdd of older laptop that i converted into portable using casing.Overall i am exhilirated after buying this product.
5,"1.Fast boot up and shutdown2.Nice build quality (except keyboard)3.Apps opens very quick4.Track pad is good (gestures works perfect)5 .Great for students - normal office use.6.Screen is not FHD but not bad at all.7.After update restart takes time (very often)8.i3 10th gen is sufficient for normal use but if you can invest more can go for i3 11 gen.So overall experience is positive but only negative i found that it is fastster than my (lenovo Z50-70,intel i7, 8gb ram,4 gb nvidia graphics, 1tb Hdd). Here SSD is the king.I suggest to go with SSD only."
1,Go for something better. The laptop has begun giving multiple issues within the first few months.Service is unhelpful. And feels like the govt era service standards by Lenovo.
5,Battery life is unbelievable and camera too. I Haven't expect such premium featured laptop in such cheap price. Lucky me! üòÜ i got it for 35k. Just go for it.
4,It's  ok
1,I am writing here after 3 months of use. The performance is only average and I got problems with the OS and keypad multiple times . I work an average of 2-3 hours a day on this laptop. When I try to open any item it open the property box. Upon searching I found out the Alt key is stuck and I need to change the keypad. I could never get peace with it after buying it.
1,"The customer supprot is pathetic, i registered complaint but there is no update on it for 3 days.There is no way to call customer support as when i try it gives me another number for ideapad which never works always busy"
1,"Am buy the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3i 10th Gen Intel Core i3 14 inch FHD Thin and Light Laptop (4GB/256GB/Windows 10/MS Office/Grey/1.6Kg), 81WD0044IN but i receive slim 3  . And its not good. motherbord is gone 15 days only."
3,"The product is a overall package and it is best for the daily use , i am a management student so i get a lot of assignments and projects , i have a lot of research work to persue so i think this system has never been slow ,it works perfect.IT HANGS WHEN I TURN ON FOR VERY FIRST TIME OF THE DAY(AFTER 4MONTHS F USE)I am using it for more than 3months now, the battery is good , the display is good ,the camera quality is okay okay not too clear but again i dont use it much so its okay,"
4,At this price range no one is giving 8gb ram and ssd.. Although everything works fine... If u r student not a heavy user then goo for it later u kay upgrade its ssd...Not satisfied with keyboard there is no bakclit.. And fingerprint some of the laptop like asus is providing fingerprint and bakclit But doesn't matter.... only performance matter now a days hope my review satisfied ur questions...
4,"Overall good choice at this price. Boosting speed is high, also performance is good"
4,"It is light weight therefore easy to carry around.. Haven't checked out all the features yet but from what i can see so far, it's a great buy for that priceSo after a couple.of months of usage, ive noticed that the sound isnt as 'surround' as promised... Speakers are quite average...The battery life is great and no issues with its other functions"
1,"The laptop I recieved is a defective. Its just been 2 days and The battery starts draining quiet fast, laptop opens automatically it doesn't shup down, nor gets connected to wifi.I requested for a replacement. I get no call when the guy is coming collect and they don't wait. As they come they ask for a new laptop serial number but I didn't got any mail. they took the new laptop with them and told some guy would come to check no one came its being a week now. The worst service."
5,"An awesome piece, with long battery life, good camera, light weight and super quick. Never heats up. I must say my first experience with Lenovo. Thank you Amazon and thank you Lenovo for giving me this precious baby."
5,The laptop is fast durable and very light weight and it has the power of Intel Core i3 10 Gen Chip so it's way faster then the 8 or 9 Gen Chips.Make sure that if you want the performance as mine just go for the (4+256) variant. Even if you're a very intensive user this thing can set you for years along...
4,"This is day one review.Overall performance and battery backup is pretty impressive.All looks good but only one drawback found related to keyboard.Quality of buttons is very low, sometime feels hard to press. Feels like amount of pressure to press different buttons is different which is very annoying."
5,"initial first hand review... just arrived..smooth feel, smooth setup..very light. feel good. balance i will update after use"
5,Very good for home user.1.battery backup is good minimum 6 hours2.booting is faster3.sound quality ok4.video graphics ok5.SSD disk size should increase6.camera quality should increase
3,No backlight keyboard as it was mentioned in the features. camera quality is just okay. It is Light in weight and is working fine as of now. Speaker output is low. There is no special feature in this laptop feels as if i paid lil extra.
5,I am very satisfied with the product. Looks class apart. Touch n feel is also awesome.  Speed also good. Solve my office purpose. I also liked the sound and display.Only drawback is of Camera quality.
5,"Fast and good laptop for daily uses business owner, the developer not suitable for gamers because the battery is not good, I like this laptop speed. fast open and close"
5,This laptop is very light weight and slim. This laptop is good for students of school as well as for students for college. It has privacy camera sutter which I like the most.I would recommend to buy 2 years warranty extension pack....
5,Bought this couple of months ago.. delivery on timeGood battery life. No slowness till now..  good choice if you are not running heavy application ..
1,"Very pathetic response by amazon customer centre....it has only 200 gb memory ...poor camera,very poor sound quality,and i purchased it today..but amazon customer centre said they can't  help me out..just go to lenovo and asked them why they made it 200 gb memory laptop"
1,Third class laptop I ever bought.... AlwaysHang itself.... Sometimes number Line are not working.... I used to restart again and again...
4,"Light weight, slim,battery ok. Camera is a joke.Cheap laptop for light use."
4,Nice laptop but it is really heavy. No laptop bag provided which is necessary for every laptop dealer
5,The laptop has a casual look which I think lenovo should give users with better design and style at this price range. its a moderte use laptop for students as it has a built in ms office 2019 with ssd which is a boost for the students.
4,DVD Rom was must
5,Fast response....no lag....light weight.....good battery backup....nice display
5,"Interestingly I did not buy it for gaming purpose at all. but for purely academic, where extensive drafting work plus online lecture was required.The size of laptop is hardly little more than the std 15.6inches screen laptop so no issue with the bulkiness but better screen area utilisation. Multiple window work is easily doable.Screen is glare free and easy on eyes,Battery life not an issue as you can adjust the refresh rate and brightness etc and enhance.The deal was superb and unmissable on account of exchange offer.Overall good deal and it served well my purpose."
5,I am not a gamer and it's my first time using a gaming laptop. Before I was on to an low performance one with just 4 gb ram and so... Back then i was dreaming of playing GTA 5 and froza horizon and i had fulfilled it through YouTube. But now I can play what ever shit I want and gives me a different feel of gaming. I regret I was too late on to msi gf series and surely will buy one for my best friend.. Thanks msi for providing this budget friendly gaming beast and supporting new gamers like me.. Iam loving it
5,"I got this laptop under 61k and I love this laptop, it's just amazing, solid bulid quality, looks simply sexy, very smooth as well as fast and it's 144hz screen was cherry on cake but it feels quite heavy otherwise it's an amazing laptop. If ur budget is approx 60k then close ur eyes and buy this without any doubt. Now windows 11 Updatedüòâ"
5,"Powerful, Compact and Robust.Overall ‚Äì BUY500gb SSD becomes way more less when you start playing games that have huge sizes, such as GTA 5, COD 2019. CyberpunkRuns the above-mentioned games very smoothly (NOT ON ULTRA specs)You can extend its storage by adding an additional hdd or sdd by taking to MSI centre. Do not do it yourself, as it will void your warranty.  1x 2.5-inch SATA Slot for SSD/HDD Expansion.

5,The difference between this and my old device  is wild. It's perfect for multi tasking . Games run without a hitch as you would expect from an msi device. The sound lacks base but super loud . Boot speed is amazing and the cooler boost sure does its thing . The amount of heat you can feel is very low. Overall it's an amazing device

4,"this review after use of 5 days.1. somebody has written that above 1TB external HD can't be used. I have used my 5TB HD for transfer of data. It is well connected and data transfer  rate is good.2. Office 360 is temporary. hence I installed my Microsoft office which works well.3. Speed is little bit slow which u may not notice if single application has operated.4. PC operates at 50 to 70 % of CPU and almost 80% of memory which make little worried to me.5. I am also using it for delivering reports through service plus  and meeting. Till yet no problems. Installed java for that.finally, i can say as on date  that for this price it is a good laptop. Keyboard is not Bluetooth and yes removable. screen has good clarity and not having good viewing angle. Speaker is pathetic but it is ok in room. Mic is fantastic. As compared to other chrome based, I prefer it, as I have to operate it for digital signature and service plus."

1,"Bought this laptop for online classes for my daughter‚Äôs online classes. Unfortunately the laptop is too slow to do anything, even Google meet is very slow. I know this is a budget laptop but nothing except for very casual browsing is possible with this. Screen and camera are also very very outdated. I would advise anyone looking at this laptop to add some extra money and get something i3 plus at least. Buy something future proof, this laptop feels like something from 20 years back."

5,I gifted it to my small son for online lectures and it's work well without any lack... Battery is also superb. Only processor should  be improved..
2,It has been 1 month and the laptop started hanging. I know the system will be slow because of the configuration. But this is too slow.
1,"Waste of Money..... This Laptop is way too slow. It has been only 20 days since I brought this and it's very slow. It hangs, sometimes the screen blurs and I have to restart it to resolve the blur issue.DON'T BUY THIS!! EVEN FOR ONLINE CLASSES."

4,"Got this awesome laptop today. Took 10 days for amazon to deliver this order, but that might be due to the covid situation. The laptop is a bit heavy, but thin. The ""grey"" color on the top is actually darker than what's seen in the pic. The screen is fabulous. Tried valorant in it today and it was okay. Gave 160fps in medium settings. There's no MS subscription but there's a one month xbox game pass.The boot up time is around 3-4 secs. i5 10th gen with 1650 is good, although 1650Ti or 1660Ti would've been better. But I suppose they can't sell laptops with such GPUs for 62k. The backlit keyboard is awesome too.The battery is okay."
5,"Display wasn't properly sealed with its bezels and it was leaking the display light from the edges where it was creating white spots! Please check this before the return window is over!Update 01: Got a replacement model, it seems the display is okay for this replacement model, but will observe it for any other defects!Update 02: Everything is perfect, loved this laptop. Just one thing about the display again, these displays don't feel robust. I would go for HP over this one. My next laptop will be other than Asus!Update 03 (October 08, 2021): Function keys for display brightness adjustment don't work at first, have to keep pressing keys and works after some time automatically."
1,My laptop arrived in a good condition but just after 2 days it's keyboard stop working and now I have placed a replacement let's see how the new laptop works
1,Initial Impressions:Such a good looking laptop with a great display 144hz under 62KAfter 2 weeks update: Games are stuttering and getting fps drops upto 100fps drop in both battery and wall adapter and now battery only lasts 45 min in battery saver mode.Amazon  can't help me as return period is over. Emailing asus doesn't help eitherCamera is not good at all I recommend using a Webcam for office purpose.UI is fluid and RGB is dope. Boots very fast about 2-3 seconds.Will update my review when I do some testing on it.Update: Gaming is very good on it about 144fps on Fortnite Competitive settings with 1080p res and Nvidia reflex + boost. I have been playing Watch Dogs also in this beast and I ve got to say that I am very happy that I went for the right laptop.Battery life is not good üòê but I recommend using the charge to 60% and using wall adapter mode in MyAsus app. Good thing is the laptop charges very fast.Gaming will drain the battery to fast so the best option is to use the wall adapter as it gives extra frames when in turbo mode.Charger gets very hot when Gaming.144hz screen is just too good for this laptop.I like the metallic finish in this version of the laptop( Fortress grey color is very nice in person gives a slight bluish metallic feel when light strikes it.)  SSD is very fast but my only complain is it is 512gb but can't complain its size for the price I got this beast for. We can also add an M.2 ssd or a 2.5 inch HDD or Sata SSD (*with included sata cable). I won't recommend using the laptop keyboard for gaming as it might not last for long period. For typing it is decent. A decent amount of port selection is appreciated. Laptop speakers are just okay and you can change to different modes in Dts:X app. The Hinge is stiff with minimal screen flex. The Screen bends upto 120¬∞ I think so. Screen gets just enough bright about 250nits. Overall Great Package üì¶. I would close my eyes and buy this laptop if your budget is 62k range.Note: Wait for Great Indian Sale guys
5,Laptop is good and perfect.....I thought at the laptop is screen ...Then I got replacement also but the reality..On battery power by default the laptop set to 60hz when ever you Plug in it changes from 60 to 144hz and when u plug out 144 to 60hz so this is why it 2 sec time screen gets off and on.....No issue in it....If you want to get rid it means right click on desktop and got display settings and goto advance system setting change 60 to 144hz then your laptop will 144hz during on battery power also then screen will not off...*Performance - 5/5*Display- 5/5*Battery- 4/5 on normal usage 3-4 hours  easily we are getting

4,"I have used this laptop for almost a week now.I found many pro's as well as cons while using this laptop.First the pros..I tested many games like Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Watch Dogs 2,Destiny 2.No problem whatsoever while gaming.Really good fps in older games like Destiny 2 and Watch Dogs 2,and decent fps in newer titles like AC Valhalla.Some setting tweak and it is possible to get almost 60 fps in Valhalla.The 144hz screen is really great,everything feels smooth tho i wont use it cause the screen is too small.I connected the laptop using hdmi to a monitor.The rgb keyboard is a nice touch.Overall it does what it is good at i.e,gaming.Now for the cons..this laptop gets waaay too loud while gaming.I use headphones and i can still listen to the noise if the volume is low.I was using a PC before so i havent experienced this kind of sound.Now comes the battery backup which is absolutely pathetic.U can barely use this laptop for 1 hour 30 mins while doing normal stuff.The backup is very bad.The other problems i faced is that the adapter gets waaay too hot and i mean it,way too hot while gaming.I plugged it in for 3 hours while gaming and it gets so hot that i almost couldn't touch it.I have to stop between my gaming sessions and unplug the charger for it to cool down which is very frustrating since i was using a PC before and never had to face this kind of problem.Now comes the camera.The camera is...bad,just bad.I would never use it for anything,i would rather use my phone camera for meetings and other stuff.So in conclusion this laptop is good for gaming while plugged in,but for watching movies with backup power,its not great and u can watch only a 2hour movie at most.I would give this laptop a 7/10."
5,"Product works fine for casual gaming. Getting close to 50-60 fps on high setting in AAA titles, and some with 30-40 in ultra setting.The laptop is a bit noisy during gameplay but is silent when performance is not need (daily tasks and surfing).Good job to Amazon for delivering me this laptop under 2 working days!!!Will further update this review every 2 quarters."

5,Ignore the negative comments I got the delivery in 3 days product came with sealed registered warranty geniune accesories #happy product
1,"Worse Service from Amazon and Asus. I got defective Product and only because i came to know that it is defective after the Replacement windows has been closed how can i accept the product. Or it is your marketing strategy to sell a defective product to customer with just 7 days of replacement Window. I wont accept the product and i cant again and again waste time on repairing it. First time mouse touch pad had not worked.. Wi-fi not connected... I requested for service then resolved it again screen display is not working and only working when display is placed at certain angle. What sort of services you are providing. I already complained and given some case for either replacement or please refund my amount i can go with some other online shopping website and also mainly i will go with some other brand, rather hoping for Asus services and products.Case Number - A2110053218-0003They said that they will revert back within 48 hrs and i didnt get ant call from your side.Worst Service Ever..."
1,It arrived with a good condition but after 2 days it's display went off!! Applied for the Replacement let's see how it works now!!
3,"PROS1. Its touch screen2. it doesn't have any fans, so doesn't make a sound.3. model is very stylish4. best for studentsCONS1. it's not 360 convertible2. it doesn't have a screensaver option3. it has a storage space of 49 gb instead of 64 gb, but works fine.4. connectivity to bluetooth is slow5. camera quality is really bad6. doesn't support all android apps7. keys are dysfunctional but you can work around it."
3,"Pros1. Boots within 5 seconds (I bet u might have never seen anything like this before)2. ‚ÄúOk Google‚Äù assistant like Siri3. Easy access like an android mobile phone4. Don‚Äôt be fooled this is not a tab, can access all android apps. Some inbuilt paid apps available for free.5. Gives Macbook like feel, fast charging and superb battery.6. Best for business travelers, presentation speakers, online teaching, learning, browsing.Cons1. Less storage capacity (usable is around 45GB only) but online cloud storage is available2. Meant only for document typing and browsing purpose, nothing much you can expect other watching movies.3. Its all Google and Google only.4. Beginners will find it a bit difficult to use this. Needs a bit of practice.5. No LAN port available. Only wifi."
1,"Screen is not upto the mark at this price point! Bad viewing angles, can see only yellowish tinge from any other angle other than the front!"
4,"The device is great when it comes to built quality, performance, trackpad, etc. I specially love speakers and mainly the keyboard which has good travel and it's just a joy to type on. I also like the Chrome OS which is better than Windows when you are going for budget laptops as they work faster.But the real problem is the display, it's 720p which is good for the price, but it has colour shifting problem like an TN display. The white balance is out of this world and there is no option to change it on the chromebook. So you need to live with it. There are even times I need to bend and watch as I can't even see anything while siting in the normal position. This isn't just my device fault, this model's display is designed like that. So I am really really warning you to check the reviews on the web before buying, mainly about the display."
4,The laptop arrived in a good condition and it was packed well. But it didn't have any receipt or warranty card inside even though a one year warranty is mentioned on Amazon. Please get back to me.
1,Device is good looking and decent.The keyboard is plastic and flimsy and letters are not visible.Screen flickering on video calls or youtube and distortedNot all android apps are supported which is supported in android phone.Screen has vertical line issues
1,"Do not fall into the trap of buying this product, this is HP‚Äôs conspiracy to dump an inferior product in the name of a chromebook. Ideally windows laptop are supposed to be expensive because of the payout for the OS & hence Chromebooks are supposed to be cheaper. In spite of this arrangement this laptop feels cheaper than a 25k windows laptop with probably a bigger screen. My mistake of trusting a brand like HP blindfoldedly. Not to mention the pain of dealing with a defective product on top of it."
1,The product is of very cheap quality and it does not support the commonly used Zoom app which is very much required in today‚Äôs Pandey situation.Poor
5,"My first Chromebook purchase. I wasn't sure how the shift from windows is going to be. But Chrome OS is great - quick, smooth, safe and very light on processor and battery.So the HP Chromebook 14a looks very premium in the silver color and its extremely light to carry around. The battery lasts for around 12 hours which seems unbelievable but it's true.I have used it for the office work with Google docs and the video conference calls and also for streaming movies. Does everything quite easily.It's been more than 2 months of using this and I can easily recommend HP CHROMEBOOK 14A for anyone looking to buy a laptop in the 25-30k price bracket. I got it under 25k during a deal and I feel it's absolutely BANG FOR THE BUCK!!"
1,Display is not working during whatsapp video call.Display is blur and fedded during video calling.
1,"Chromebook is not a matured product yet. Many apps which work on Android devices don't get installed on Chromebook or don't work similar to Android devices. This gap should be fixed by Google Play Store otherwise it's waste of investment on Chromebook ideology. Also keyboard missing delete button. I'm now using it for few months and there are already lot of bugs in Chrome OS like it keeps auto right clicking all the time rendering the laptop unuseful, rebooting multiple times helps pause this issue for some time. Product seems not properly tested before releasing."
1,Laptop is good with touch screen. But it is chrome os and can't install windows os so I wasted money buying this. They are not taking returning this product also üòîüòî
5,"This chromebook is awesome.Pros: 1. It is lightweight and super fast (boots up and shuts down within 5 seconds)2. Battery lasts for 12- 15 hours for continuous tasks, it takes about 2 hours to charge fully.3. Screen sensitivity is up to mark.(Touchscreen sensitivity)4.Does all the basic job . I would recommend this to those buyers who want a laptop for daily light to medium based work like streaming, browsing, online classes ,watching movies ,listening to music,  a little editing and programming. At this price range you will not get such laptop with such a high quality.5. No lag at all. For buyers this is based on chrome os and not windows, so first time chrome os users may find it a bit difficult to use.6. Better than any windows operated laptop (within 30-35k)Cons: 1. The webcam quality is not so good but does the job.2. It is strictly not for gaming purpose or heavy editing or programming like java or C++.3. It does not run all the applications available on playstore.4. Storage capacity is low (49 gb only) , so I would suggest you to buy an external micro sd card for increasing storage capacity. So , this chromebook is basically made for students. Students can definitely but it without any hesitation(better than any other laptop within 30-35k). But for gamers and heavy editors , I would suggest you not to buy it. Thank you."
2,"Pros-1.Fast and light2.Touchscreen is good3.Battery lasts long(10+ hours)and charging from 0 to 100 takes only a hour and few mins.4.Sound quality is good. Cons-1. Less storage2. Camera quality is extremely bad.3. Not all apps from play store is supported.4. Texts and display quality is poor and it's glitch a bit except from chrome browser. (Not suitable for reading :( )5. No backlit keyboard6. Chrome browser runs automatically when start.6. Screen brightness is always default (need to change it lower everytime when start) üò¨üò™7.

5,"Do NOT get fooled by the negative reviews, it‚Äôs a great laptop!Most of the negative reviews here (or on Flipkart) are because people are buying this Chromebook (or the 14a-na0003tu, which is the same device in SIlver instead of White) expecting it to be a full-fledged powerful laptop which it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs like buying a bicycle expecting it to be a motorbike and then whining because the bicycle is not acting like a motorbike.The screen is fairly bright for indoor usage and decent viewing angles. It is a touch-sensitive screen as well, in case you‚Äôre into that kind of stuff. However, the screen is glossy instead of matte so you can see a lot of reflections unless kept at specific angles. It's also 'sticky', so you'll get a lot of dust even if you don't touch the screen, and a lot of fingerprints if you do. I'd suggest buying a set of microfiber cloth alongside it.The speakers aren‚Äôt very clear or loud, but they are front-firing (instead of some laptops where it‚Äôs at the bottom ‚Äî why?) they sound fine.I was expecting the performance to be mediocre while buying since it has just an Intel Celeron processor with 4GB of RAM, but ChromeOS is surprisingly light and my usage has been smooth so far. The laptop boots up (and shuts down) in seconds and you can also link it with your Android phone and do Internet sharing and notification syncing. It does not lag and works just fine even with a lot of apps open at the same time. There is only 64GB of inbuilt storage, out of which only around 45 GB is available, and you can expand via a microSD card if you need, but you probably won‚Äôt need to since most apps are Web-based.Regarding the availability of apps, it‚Äôs mostly Web apps that can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store and have almost the entire functionality when compared to their Windows or macOS versions. Progressive Web Apps (the little Install icon on the right of the address bar when you open sites like YouTube or Spotify) can also be installed and they work the same way. You can also install any website as an app even if it‚Äôs not a PWA. You can also download Android apps from the Google Play Store but the experience is a mixed bag. A lot of the apps are optimised for Android phones with comparatively smaller screens and have weird scaling issues when opened in full screen. But a lot of them run fine without any issues, just like they would do on your Android phone. And yes, you can use MS Office on this laptop by either the Web-based version or the Android app, both of which have enough features to not make you miss the Windows or macOS versions.There‚Äôs Linux support as well, which is still in Beta, but the feature works fine for a general use case. And it keeps getting better with every ChromeOS update. You can use the terminal to install Linux based apps and most of them work without any major issues.And there‚Äôs the Google Assistant (with ‚ÄúOk Google‚Äù), which if you already use, I don‚Äôt need to explain the greatness, and if you don‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt explain the greatness ‚Äî you have to use it to experience it.The keyboard is nice to type on. The keys are big and have good travel and there‚Äôs no wobble in them. The keys on this particular model are white with black text and have a little grainy finish on them which look and feels very nice (I can‚Äôt say the same for the Silver version). The plastic touchpad is big and accurate and I did not find any issues with it. The camera will not blow anyone‚Äôs mind but is good with decent colours and a wide-angle.The battery life is amazing! It lasts around 8 hours easily with moderate use like web development and some music playing in the background. If you‚Äôre just watching movies or using Google Docs or Word, it should last even longer.One thing to note is that the laptop expiration date is June 2026, which means it will still work just fine, but will not receive any new ChromeOS updates after that. This does not depend on when you‚Äôre buying the laptop, so don‚Äôt expect it to last long if you‚Äôre getting it later in its lifetime.The only two cons I can find here are the lack of a backlit keyboard and a 720p display instead of a 1080p display. But I can‚Äôt complain about it at this price.Overall, it‚Äôs a good laptop for general home usages like watching movies, playing some light games and document processing. You can also do some light programming on this because of the Linux support. If that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôre looking for, I would recommend this over any Windows laptop at this price.Do NOT get fooled by the negative reviews, it‚Äôs a great laptop!Most of the negative reviews here (or on Flipkart) are because people are buying this Chromebook (or the 14a-na0003tu, which is the same device in SIlver instead of White) expecting it to be a full-fledged powerful laptop which it‚Äôs not.

3,"Firstly Product description is misleading . It only has an eMMC  but title says SSDDevice is light weight & fine for light productivity use , school work etc . But struggles with heavy mid- heavy workloads . CPU is the limiting factor understandably .OS  is snappy & frequently updated üëçüèº. Screen is average ,not that good  for movies & photo viewing  . Lacks contrast & colour depth .  Wifi stability could be better .Make sure you check the warranty details for computer purchases .I got a device with warranty start date 10 days before purchase . Both Amazon customer care & HP were hesitant to change it to actual delivered date . EXPECTED AMAZON CC TO PITCH IN PROACTIVELY,  INSTEAD OF AN ""IT CAN'T BE DONE"" KIND OF RESPONSE ."
3,"The Legendary chrome book,  that performs like a 2gb ram, (it's 4gb ram model ), I had to return the first one and since there's no option for refund,  had it replaced by another one,  thanks anyways,  second one same model is working fine but not the 4gb models performance,  updated it to latest version of chrome,  using it as daily driver,  since it's upgrade of my 2gb Acer chrome book which is still doing good,  this one's not up to the mark,  sorry Hp, I wasted 25k on this honestly,  buyers looking for Hp chrome book, Avoid all together!!"

4,"overall the product is good ..thickness is very good......light weight ...and touch screen good....pubg gaming and cod gaming is not that good unless u add some graphic card or etc......the only problem is the display , but for this price range it is the best laptop for a collage students .........basic gaming is very good no lags ....and another problem is miscroft apps are paid apps , u need to buy them to use them......portable laptop......"
5,"I have been using it for 4 months, its my secondary device.pros:1.Good battery life2.Touch is good, better not to use because it is not convertible3.Good keyboard4.HD+ good screen5.simple OS6.Boots in 5 seconds7.Good speakers8.Charges in 1 hour9.Brightness is good10.Updates are frequent.Cons:1.White balance of screen is different in different angles2.No backlit keyboard3.Camera is average4.the processor can handle simple games(like alto's odyssey) from playstore or simultaneously run 6 apps or 25 tabs in chrome over that you will face lag5.laptop is bit heavier."
5,"Okay, as a tech enthusiast, I've been looking for a Chromebook for a while and after doing some research, I narrowed down to this.Firstly, the delivery was the same day, which I didn't want to believe to be fair, but it happenedA few things to keep in mind before you buy a Chromebook in general, is that they are not your windows or Mac devices. Although the functionality of the devices will be limited, these are still quite capable devices.Coming to this particular device, What I love about this:The keyboard is surprisingly better than i was expecting at this price pointIt is a touch screen which I might not use, but will come in handy for most peoplethe trackpad is decentbattery life is greatThere is a bit of a learning curve but you will enjoy the deviceConsThe screen isn't full HDBuild quality is plastic, good plastic, but plastic nonethelessOverall, this Chromebook can be a daily use laptop for many people who are looking for Web Browsing, WFH and Basic task.Please don't expect this Chromebook to run premiere pro or photoshop. And please don't look at things it can't do look at things that it can."
5,"Its a mind blowing purchase , At the very little cost you are getting a great quality product performance is mind blowing looks are mind blowing and if we compare it with the MacBook air it is giving a tough competition to it and chrome OS is mind blowing no lags know and complexity it is very easy to use and you have to think beyond Windows because windows constantly having problem like viruses lags crashing and all less battery back up but it has a battery backup of 12 hours, Believe in my words you would never regret if you have basic expectation With a mobile phone or laptop this is a wonderful device I recommend all an Amazon is wonderful and very helpful"
5,Best laptop under this price range .
4,"These are my first impressions about the productThe Pros is it is lightweight, has a nice touchscreen and a keyboard, so it serves as a laptop and also like a tab, which is very convenient. I found most of the features are helpful and the time it takes to start is very less, compared to the MS os. Charging is good and stays on for much of the time.Con is about the keyboard key placement, no End key or Del key which is very critical for working on Docs and Excel files. for every delete operation, we got to go to the end and press backspace ,which is irritating, also the power key is above the backspace key, and accidentally one can press the power key, which will turn off the laptop.overall it is a decent product for the price range it offers."
5,"Overall good product to buy at this price range. Very much happy and easy to carry. It is good those who looking for normal usage of browsing, YouTube videos, small games with battery üîã backup of more than 12 hours if it is charged full battery.Pros:1. Good design and light weight. Easy to carry.2. Booting Speed less than 5 seconds.3. YouTube ads are default blocked by chrome OS and more convenient to watch YouTube videos like Premium without any charges per month.4. Very Good Battery üîã backup more than 12 hours.5. Browsing and touch screen is nice.6. Fast charging support.7. Price is less 25k budget Chromebook Laptop.Cons:1. Finding difficulty to type and save word document (Ex.,) Resume typing, etc., able to do only using online Google Docs and finds difficulty in Text alignment and copy to local harddrive, but feels not much convenient like Windows OS.2. If I connect my Samsung Galaxy A70 with Type C port, files are showing very slow, and not able to copy to harddrive. Instead of copy via Type C cable, I have copied via ""InShare Android App -> Web Sharing when connected to same WiFi"".3. Bluetooth Connection is failed frequently when we disconnected, we may needs to Reboot Chromebook again for restore connection, feeling very bad for this issue. Since, I am always use Bluetooth Speaker üîä for audio / playback.4. Not all Android apps are supported like mobile phones.5. Only low memory games supported otherwise, you will endup with Screen hanged up while loading the game."
4,"After reading all the reviews, thought of giving it a try and I had mixed feelings. Here are my observations.1. Super Fast. Apps get installed at a sheer pace. Uninstalling hardly takes 2 seconds.2. Touch Screen is very good and responsive.3. HD Ready Screen, not so good. However, at this price, you can't get better. Not sure of ASUS counterpart though.4. Audio Output is average from both earphones and the speakers. Could have been a lot better. At max volume, it's very bad. Gives a rattling type output.5. Camera is just fine. Does the job for normal video calls on Skype & Zoom.6. Microsoft Excel/ Word/ PPT need 365 subscription. However you can edit or work on the above using Google Sheets/Docs/Slides.7. You can set wallpaper on homescreen (From any source, Your files too) as well as Lockscreen (Only from Google Photos)Overall, ""Can Try"" device for this price point."
1,"Bought this in March 2021. Stopped working in a few days.Engineer came and fixed, suggesting issue with battery.In mid July laptop stopped working again. Engineer visited and replaced the motherboard.Then asked to call HP for installing operating system! HP call center after hours of wasting my time asked me to visit service center.Nobody picks calls at the service center. Mumbai has only one, that too at Sakinaka.Service center guy says you need to bring a 32 GB bootable hardisk with software preloaded from HP website."
4,"Chromebook does not allow you to sideload apps from storage.Apps can be installed from official app store only. (workarounds ie development mode is painful)So if you are considering it for use with Byju's app or similar, Pl don't.MS office doesn't work either, so you need to use WPS office or similar.However, that said, as long as you are okay with aforementioned restrictions, this is a wonderful notebook with great battery backup."
5,"Good for students and employees who need laptop for office use like excel, ppt, etc. Not at all recommend for one  who are expertise especially in graphic design, animation, high end games etcc.ProExcellent touchscreenLight weightAttractiveFast100 gb Google cloud for 1 year.Mobile Google to laptop Google synchronisationDis advEMC hardisk that only 64 gbNot for high end users,.Not all android app are working in laptop"
5,This laptop is a perfect chromebook.1. Its battery life is amazing2. Cheap affordable touch screen laptop3. Can easily replace your windows laptop4. Runs almost same like your android phone5. More user-friendly than a windows laptop
1,"No. Don't waste money by taking this labtop, unless it will allow Windows operating system to install. It's just large version of mobile with bigger screen. There is no difference between this labtop & mobile. Unfortunately, I have wasted money by taking this labtop. Even company not provide microsoft office for free."
5,"The product is excellent for office use. 7 hours battery life with light music in the background while working on docs. The battery life is a huge win.Keyboard is excellent! I do a lot of drafting and found the keyboard accurate and comfortable. The touchscreen is a huge plus, I've stopped carrying/using a mouse with me.You can install linux based apps on the chromebook as well. Thereby, the overall value for money is just top notch."
5,Chromebook is better than windows my children loved it but they should give laptop bag also overall very nice
3,"Only for browsing and watching movies, best for student online classes, not at all used for office work. Just like a android tab with keyboard. Windows OS users please make sure to double check before buying there is no return policy, I bought it for office use and now using for kids online classes üòî"

1,Microsoft Word documents are Not editable. Very very much disappointed... It says unauthorized MS Office
4,Laptop is lightweight. Seems to be cheap plastic. It is of a good speed now as windows seems to get slower over the period.It makes big noise from processor fan which is surprising.I am yet to review other options.Screen seems to be nice.Keyboard is not backlight and seems to be hard.Soft touch is expected with technological advancement.
5,"The specs are great. SSD, big RAM. Works good overall. 9/10.The viewing angles aren't great though. You would not want more than one person watching a movie on this screen."

4,Mind-blowing purchase
1,"Whenever I try to connect my wired mouse , the system hanged"
1,Kindly share me product key for home & students MS office for functioning of the same.
2,I bought this product yesterday . Its getting too much heat even in 5 sec use
5,Not used by me has been gifted to my neice
4,New laptop but charging issue....
4,The laptop is OK but takes long to load apps. I think the new laptop should have been faster. I am using it for basic functions but still its performance is not as it should be.
5,"I have the capacity to buy 60k worth laptop but my intent to use the laptop is for entertainment and study related to work. Find below my review:- For the price of Rs. 36,500 this laptop is worth every penny.- SSD hard drive, so no lag in opening and working on multiple stuff.- received firmware update, which is really good.- backlight for the Keyboard which you don't get even in a 40k worth HP laptop.- Sound is pretty loud. Loud enough to attend calls, watch movies and listen to songs. Sound is crisp and there is no shrill sounds.- Even the adapter for the laptop is not heavy.- touch is smooth and multi finger gesture is also very smooth. No lag during zooming.- Key travel on the keyboard is also good. Keys are soft.- light weight and very sturdy build quality.- Packaging had 2 carton layers and then the laptop carton box itself. Don't fear about any transit damages.- Camera is good enough to have a decent clarity during the call. Its very good in well lit condition.- Heat is very well managed and the fan sound is not audible during normal use.Cons:- Don't expect to play games in this laptop as this laptop is only for entertainment and study purpose. I dont play games so I dont care."
4,Value for money product but the screen quality is good poor some time it defecult to read sound quality of system is also good
4,"1)No backlit keyboard even though it is mentioned in the description.Amazon team needs 2 days to resort that2)Laptop not booting after windows 11 update-again the amazon team needs 4 days to figure that out.Terrible experience.People should buy it from a store so that they can help in person rather wasting time over customer care like I did.4 hours of call and no resolution.Update after using it for 2 days:-The laptop is very good when it is on windows 10.Fast and build quality is strong.On 8 gb it is smooth,will be a beast on 20 gb.Update after a week :-One word-Fast & worth the price.The config is better than the other brands which charge 5k extra.Upgrade ram in that cost difference."
5,Everything is fine but a little disappointment as there's no lifetime subscription for ms office 365.That's it as of now. Enjoy!
5,SSD Makes it very fast i must say but don't buy it for gaming or editing couse screen quality is below average otherwise all good.
5,Excellent quality fit and finish. Nice keyboard and mousepad. All latest features. Successfully updated windows 11. Highly recommended. Thank you Amazon for excellent customer service.
4,Writing the review after using two days of laptop. It‚Äôs was slim and good. Best part is boot time due to SSD. Few issues with fan because placed in front  of screen.
4,Value for money product cause 256GB SSD and 1TB HHD and clock speed is good for this price range. It's very slim product. Already installed ms office in this  product. Sound is Little bit slow. Picture quality is average.
4,I dislike the fact that they write there is a backlit keyboard if it is not present and Microsoft Office 365 subscription is only a one month trial rest the laptop is beast at 8 gb ram very fastNeed 8 seconds to boot up
4,It gets heated during watching OTTs. Rest everything else is excellent.
5,Very nice product in this price range....everything is good.
1,The seller has refused to provide complimentary 1 year amazon prime membership which was written in the offers when i purchased the product.Now the amazon team is saying there was no such offer.Very disspointed by the seller
3,I would like speed .I didn't like small screen size and weight
1,"Worst screen resolution...,no Microsoft office installed.  Don't buy.... Go for Hp 14s silver by using some extra money ...."
1,"The keyboard and touchpad are not working properly,lot of heat and worst product from the Acer company"

1,Laptop getting hang very much and very much slow start.This is happening within 2 days of purchase
1,HI I HAD PURCAHSED THIS LAPTOP IN JUNE WITHIN 1 MONTH THE LAPTOP IS NOT WORKING WHEN I RAISED TO HP INDIA THEY ARE SOME PART ARE DAMAGED AND THEY WILL REPLACE HOWEVER IT 25 DAYS STILL NO RESOLUTION FROM THEM.ALSO I AM NOT SURE QULATIY OF PRODUCT OFFERED BY AMAZON AND SELLER MAY BE POSSIBLE THE SELLER SELL DUPLICCATE PRODUCT AND AMAZON SELLS ON THERE WEBSITE FOR BIG COMMISSION.TO ALL THE GENINUE BUYER I RECOMMEND NEVER BUY LAPTOP FROM AMAZON OR SELLER THEY AR ENOT TRUSTWORTH.YOU MIGHT SAVE SOME MONYE ON DISCOUNT  / OFFER BUT WILL HAVE NO GUARANTEE ABOUT PRODUCT QUALITY.ALSO WILL RECOMMEND EITHER TO GO FOR DELL FOR SOME OTHER LAPTOP WHICH HAVE BETTER AFTER SALES SERVICEHP INDIA HAS PATHETIC SERVICENEVER BUY ANY LAPTOP FROM AMAZON WILL RECIEVE DUPLICATE PRODUCT FROM SELLERTHUMS DOWN AMAZON SELLER AND HP INDIA
5,"Was worried about speed issues that many had complained in the reviews. But still went ahead with the purchase. After powering on there is quite a few updates that will happen. At that time i found it to be slow(background downloads and installations will happen) Go to updates and ensure that there are no pending updates. Once all the updates are applied, the laptop is perfectly fine. My kid is using for schools and other assignment. If you are using a browser + MS office applications +zoom(or other vide chat apps), there is absolutely no problem with this laptop. it is absolutely fine. Not sure about gaming though"
2,"Lookwise & bodywise ok. But it is too slow and hangs a lot, dont buy it..."
1,"I had purchased this laptop, and got it with faulty one, immediately replaced it and got one more with display faulty. Put my laptop into refund, and these amazon people made me run behind them so much and nearly 2 weeks after they took laptop from me, and they still didnt initiate the refund.worst experience for the first time with amazon.Please dont buy htis and waste ur time as well as ur money.Amazon has falled down for me now."
1,"The product was defective and it took a couple of months to just initiate a return . Calling the customer support for help took a while . The technicians didn‚Äôt turn up at all. The person who came to take the return item didn‚Äôt have patience to turn on the laptop and check the serial number and did not pick up the item . The second time after initiating the return I just received a message that said couldn‚Äôt pick up the item from customer . I‚Äôm always home , no calls from Amazon but just received a message that the item could not be picked up . I had a lesson that valuable items should not be ordered online ."
3,Suggesting to go for SSD instead of hdr as it tooks a solid 40 seconds for booting which is very annoying.
4,Value for money laptop from an branded manufacturer.
5,"Good laptop under budget with all specifiction required.Little slow while starting, rest behaving good while working.Plastic quality of laptop disappointed this could be better."
1,"The product is worst. It is a 11th gen i3 processor, but the performance is dead slow. The display is faulty. Lot of white spots on the display when the screen is black. Poor customer service from Amazon. Still waiting for service arranged by Amazon. They sell faulty electronic items and do not allow refund to return. Who need a replacement faulty device? Bad experience"
4,Good product .Have decent speed for daily use .The keypad buttons are big enough and feels good .The storage space is more than sufficient .The genuine windows 10 and ms office package come with it .It's light weight and easy to carry.However on flop side the key board is made of plastic whivh could have been better.do not come with licensed anti virus device.The ram speed could have been better and the I3 processor could have been upgraded. Over all it'd decent product for its purchase cost.
2,"I just got this yesterday and it took close to 4 hours to get it setup. Even after spending that much time, here are some issues still bothering me.1. No proper instructions or warranty information present.2. MS Office was not present. Had to contact HP support to install it..but it still doesnt work. It asks for activation key.3. Microphone quality is very poor. The person on the other side cannot hear me properly.4. When i connect the headphones, they are not detected.5. System is very very slow (probably because of all the software getting updated). But even after 12 hours it is slow so can't exactly blame software update.6. The plastic and overall quality looks cheap.7. No number lock indicator.8. Fan is too noisy and CPU/Memory/Disk one of it is always close to 100%.So i am thinking of returning this if the issues are not resolved in a day or two."
5,"Although it is too early to provide a feedback with only two days of use however I am providing this feedback because the experience is too good till now. Few additional features can add more user friendly experience like it doesn't contains keyboard background light. Also, the first time when you open the laptop, it started taking update from Microsoft. So connect with a good LAN or Wi-Fi and be patient to install the update."
1,"I ordered it during sale at 41K . Unfortunately could not returned it during return window.Its not at all worth the price. It's terribly slow. Don't go by the configuration.I am a Dell and Apple fan, bought HP first time. My 7 year old Dell laptop has much more faster performance and good built. It was bought at same range 40KOnly good things about this one are loud & clear sound quality and its light weight.All other things bad.Would not recommend it."
2,"Don't waste your hard earned money in this waste product. Not worth buying. For the first time i am writing review. Takes too long to start, has a plastic body which makes it look so cheap."
1,Very worst and poor performance and taking the much time to open the applications and folders as well. It‚Äôs did not meet the expectations as per the item description. And Amazon is misleading the public with fake information and without quality check of products they are selling and making the customers fools. I sincerely request to all don‚Äôt encourage this product and as well as Amazon as well. This is not 1st time it was happened earlier and I had a bad experience with the same HP product. Finally the same issue has happened. I really fed up with Amazon customer service and products. Don‚Äôt believe Amazon especially with electronic gadgets.
4,"Product is good . But the processor use little bit lagging. When I power on, after that it will take a time to open a app.Also I don't like the cover skin.*Products is light weighted* display is awesome cool.*Charging time is less*Sound quality is good"
1,Vary vary poor quality....plz gyus don't buy this laptop üôÑüôÑ
3,"Packing worst, everything is opened not sealed used or notLittle bit price highBody is cheap qualityWorking wise goodBooting btine little lag maybe not 15.6 inc"
1,"It is system with 8GB, but working like 2GB system. Frequently hanging, any operation there is lag. mouse pointer also struck always. it always asks for restart the laptop. Rs.41000/- is waste for this machine."
4,"Reading good comments here, bought this. Been using this since 3 days, and I see slowness, installed only chrome. Chrome doesnt open fast, had to do some diagnostics to improve performance (marginal). I have now scheduled a technician visit, if that doesnt solve, I'm returning.After writing this review, I see good performance :) not sure what changed. I believe, the OS was downloading stuff and optimising. Have been using this since a week now and no complaints"
5,"I am using since 2 months,  its very eay to use, easy to install all applications. I booked installation service which helped me divide the hard disk into 3 allocations. Windows and Microsoft Office are lifetime valid. I also use for multiple software applications, rarely lags."
2,After two month of use I am writing this review.please dont Buy is laptop as it is very very slow. It takes too much time to start also. As I am not using any antivirus software than also speed is very poor.
3,"Construction quality is not good... Intial start take linger after that ok. Hinges are not smooth and rigid, battery life is not impressive. For students ok.. Or first laptop users not find differences."
4,I likeProcessor speed display all connectivity fast charging battery backup upto 5 hours lightweight slim design overall good packageDislikePlastic type body design matte finish colour feel like low quality material and last the power button not feeling so good
1,I recieved laptop after  5 th days. IIS not working I showen in hp show he as given me doan letter it is not
2,"the keyboard quality is very poor and i am hocked to feel that this is a brand new laptop received an hour ago and even with just 10-15 mins of work, it is heated. what will happen after an year? don't recommend:-("
5,Overall very good purchase üëç
5,"Wonderful quality and make. As shown, as expected and delivered the same. Happy so far."
4,Great value for money. Very fast and responsive. Has a great video and audio quality
1,"Don't go for dell, they sell stones. High price no quality and support. They ask for money even in gurantee period."
1,Gets heated like an oven. Unbelievabley poor built quality. Laptop hinge came out within one month of use. Now waiting for warranty service. Don't know what else is waiting..
5,"Dell is always my first preference for windows laptops. This model is feature rich and is a best choice under 40k. No heating issues , great battery life and sleek and stylish makes it best model in this category."
3,"The Laptop is below par. Actually I bought it in exchange of my HP i3 old generation but sometimes it feels this is even slow than that old one.After 3 day of use ( i3 10th gen/8GB RAM/1TB hdd):1. Speed is super slow and keeps getting hang for 2-5 mins.2. Anything you do hard disk reaches 100% usage and everything gets stuck.Maybe it's maccafe antivirus trail that comes pre installed that is doing this.3. Sound is ok neither good nor bad.4. Internet - I am connected to 250mbps and achieved download of around 25mbps so this is perfect.5. Boot time 2-3 minutes6. Transfer speed from usb/hdd to laptop is good.7. Transfer speed within HDD from one drive to other is 2-5 Mbps which is ultra low.8. Delivery and exchange was good. Done on specified date.9. Camera is just pathetic - 0.3 MP - If you plan to do video calls for office or school you need to buy external cam. Integrated cam is just pathetic and cannot be used.Suggestions- As of now I feel you should not buy this one. Better go for HP.Edited - Amazon and Lennovo team called and helped with different tools. Seems like the Lennovo site tool is not showing correct data. Adding 1 star for support availability. However, system is still very slow for a 10th gen i3 with 8GB ram. Another point to note is you cannot return/replace that option shows not available."
5,"Great looks good got this in 31,740üëç"
3,I m writing this review after using it for more than 2 months now.... It has got a slow processor.... It hangs on platforms like zoom... You need to have a lots of patience to wait for your mails getting loaded... It's mic stops working abruptly and start working again in its own.... When I took it to the service centre they asked me to put one more device in it for better speed.... That was worth rps 7000....i already spent do much money on this laptop and still I need to add more items to it for better functioning... Moreover it is not reliable when I have to take online meetings.... Very disappointed with the product.... Now only used by my daughter for watching YouTube kids
5,"Laptop is as per the description provided. Battery back up for work is good, but for continuous video calls of school, it drains in an hour. But overall it is a good buy for the value.. I got it for 33,000/-"
4,"It's a good laptop only for basic users but considering the price, good deal."
2,Not very satisfied with the laptop... It says Dolby Audio but very poor sound quality. No sound at all... Screen quality is average.
3,No pre-installed MS office
5,Performance is good as using from couple of months..highly recommended
5,Very good product as per price very smooth operation light weight dont believe on negative reviews this is fantastic product for daily usage
1,"Really facing an issue with this laptop,was late by one day,cant return it,lap is being too laggyDont know what to do nowü•∫"

4,"As I have used the product since it is received and I have experienced and noticed that this product is awesome and  recommend to all to buy this product if anyone wants to purchase, I have only noticed that build quality of outsideframe is not strong and need to be improvement on Laptop body"
1,"Loss of money, it is having a slow processor, it takes 15 minutes to start and even more timeAs per my experience itz loss of money and nothing elseIt works tooo slow and takes time for every task"
1,The laptop is I have hardly used but started giving trouble for starting. Worst product from Lenovo ever had in
5,Device is very nice but delivery is very unexpected because whenever I have order from Amazon the product comes within 2 days
4,"Overall it's a good laptop. Just one thing about screen, if we put the laptop on high place and watch it from below clearity decreases."
4,"The laptop superb in terms of performance. Useful for any office work, programming, mid-range gaming etc.. Battery life is about 4-5 hours depending on use..However, display panel technology is outdated. This will not useful if the work is color intensive."
5,"The internal storage is not big so of course you‚Äôre not able to put much files. But I‚Äôm only using for basic school works and videocall (classes). And for watching movies and stuffs, everything is available online and apps are there so I really don‚Äôt download anything. It‚Äôs fast and switching from one app to another is smooth and fast. Load apps fast too."
5,Na
4,Nice laptop with good features but battery could be improved as I got only 5 hrs SOT where my office laptop got around 12 hrs SOT.
5,"At this price (49.99 K) its an awsome buy, Only 2 days now, Windows and Office 2019 home and student life time warranty. Flawless working, Only thing is SSD should have been 512 gb.  Scope for expansikn : RAM can only be ipgraded up to 12 gb and there is no space for HDD, only existing SSD can be replaced to 512 gb or 1 tb. I recommend you to buy min 512 gb ssd. No lag, Booting very fast, thanks to 256 gb SSD.  I strongly recommend this product."
3,"The makers of this product are too smart, they have, despite giving a slot for expansion have expanded the battery in that place because of which you cannot expand the storage (HDD)... Other than this the product is very very cool with some great features."
4,Out of 256 gb ssd 196gb available....Screen quality not good..i got this in 47k.So intel i5 is present ...so performance is super fine.Build quality is plastic...built quality could have been better...
1,Not good
5,Everything is awesome
2,Major issue is quality of customer care. You have to dial multiple numbers to get any kind of a resolution. So beware.
5,"Made the best decision of purchasing this affordable machine. Quick boot up, great for working on Microsoft Office and entertainment. The FHD display makes binging my favourite shows on Netflix a pleasant experience and the bezels are narrow so the screen is always in my focus. The sound quality is good and the backlit keyboard aids in working during the night. Friends recommended i5 11th Gen processor over the 10th Gen or i3 and the difference in performance is evident. With all my subscriptions I hardly store any movies on the laptop and 256gb  storage is more than enough."
5,"Ordered this yesterday, it is a super light and fast laptop. i5 11th Gen processor is super zippy and the 256GB SSD helps in fast boot up. 256GB is more than enough storage for me, you will be surprised as to how less of storage that we actually use. The display is great with FHD resolution and 250 Nits display and with very narrow bezels. The sound quality is good. The laptop comes with a backlit keyboard which is a nice touch. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. Thank you Amazon."
1,The laptops have hardware issues. Not recommended to buy at all. I had different model which needs hardware repair every 2-3 months.
1,"Laptop is NOT as Expected.Product Information is not clear.This laptop is launched in Singapore and Malaysia not in India.The Seller is not providing correct InformationCONS:1.Laptop body is Plastic and Plastic quality is poor.At this price they should provide Build quality2.Battery also discharging very fast.Hardly you can get upto 3 to 3.5hr3.Does not support Fast charging.It will take 3Hr  to fully charge(Most of the laptops at this price range comes with rapid charging(60% in 40min) like Mi,ASUS,Dell..etc)4.Sound Quality is Average5.Laptop having only 3 usb and 1 HDMI port and microSD slot.NO Lan,NO Type C6.Ms Office is Not licenced.you only get 3days.At this range others offering  1year lisenced.7. Macafee also trial vertion.Only works for 30 days.8.Camera Quality is very poor.If you turn on Cam ,you can see your Zombie Face on Screen ;)PROS: Please DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY IN BUYING THIS LAPTOP. Go for other brands Like ASUS,Mi,Dell."
1,"Keypad is not working properly. On pressing one character , the screen is showing another character. Also problem with the start button. There maybe other faults which are not yet discovered.Very bad experience from Amazon. Totally unexpected and Frastated!!!"
3,with 10th gen i5 and  512 SSD laptop is super quick for installing software and bootup time but the display is a complete disappointment.Viewing angles are worst and anti-glare coating is just a gimmick.I tweaked display settings a  bit and now its avg.Battery backup is avg (4 hours).No backlight keyboard :( again cost-cutting.50 k is not worth for this laptop should have been more aggressive like 40-43k
1,Received the laptop today. Opened & booted & checked the manufacturer's warranty. It's showing 10 months instead of one year. See pic attached??????
5,"I did a lot of research before finalizing this laptop. I wanted a laptop that could be used for online classes, but also something that I can use once in a while for some browsing, Netflix , excel & powerpoint. I wanted a laptop that was light and easy to carry and that would not become outdated in a year. Therefore I chose a 14‚Äù formfactor, i5 10th gen processor, 8GB RAM & 512GB SSD.Pros of the laptop.1. Performance -> First and foremost, this is the reason you buy a laptop. The 10th gen i5 processor along with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of Solid state Drive, means the performance for most common usage like Chrome, excel, powerpoint, google meet, zoom, Vlc, Netflix etc are really crisp. I have opened 10 different tabs on chrome without lag while also running zoom.  Bootup is super-fast. Only caveat is that the machine does not have dedicated graphics, so I am not sure of gaming performance or how it would run photoshop or other editing applications. Please DO NOT buy a laptop with just a 5400 rpm HDD and 4GB RAM in 2020. The performance with windows 10 is just awful. 8GB RAM + SSD is must.2. Plug and Play. The laptop has genuine windows along with Microsoft office Home and Student 2019 lifetime edition (Word Excel PowerPoint & One Note). You just need to activate it using a Microsoft account. So, it has everything you need right from the start3. Design and display. This is a mixed bag for me. I have put this under pros because the laptop is light weight, looks really nice and screen is full HD (1920 x 1080). The screen has an anti glare coating which is really useful, especially for long hours of classes in front of the laptop. Main issue here is that the body is made of plastic. The plastic does feel durable though. So, it is passable. Similarly, the display is not IPS, hence the viewing angles are not great, and the colour accuracy definitely could be better. However, I really could not find a laptop at this price point with an IPS display which also had SSD and 8GB RAM (which was my primary buying criteria) Overall on this front it is 3.5 stars.4. Privacy shutter on the webcam. This is a really nifty feature. I can physically switch off the webcam when I am not using it. This ensures that no one can hack my webcam to spy on me!Coming to the Cons ->1. Battery Life -> I was getting about 3.5 hours of battery life on 1 charge. I tried setting it to battery saver mode in Q control in Lenovo Vantage and managed 4.5hours (50% brightness). But inherently the product has 35Whr battery along with a powerful i5 processor and full HD screen. Some solves that I have tried- I have updated all drivers, reduced brightness to about 75% and using in power saver mode. Getting between 4hr to 4.5 hours. You will need to carry the charger with you if you need a day‚Äôs use.2. Webcam -> While the privacy shutter is a superb addition, the webcam itself is not great. I think it is a basic 720p webcam. The video is just about passable. It is extremely grainy especially if the lighting is not great. For regular professional video conferences, I would recommend buying an external webcam. For school use, it is just about ok. But for a 50K laptop, Lenovo should have done better. I guess, no one paid much attention to webcams in laptops. Even 10K phones have 16MP cameras!!Overall ->Despite the 2 issues stated above, the pros outweigh the cons and I would definitely recommend the product. I also updated the warranty for 3 years paying additional 2K. Final recommendation -> Buy a laptop with 8GB RAM and 512 GB SSD. You will not regret the extra investment."
1,"Very poor display.Very poor audio quality.Bad keyboard setting, very easy to enter dust and small particles inside the laptop.Battery support is about max 4 hours for moviesYou can't enjoy movies due to poor video resolution and poor audio quality50k is worthy and at all not applicable for such poor quality laptop.This is one type of cheating by Amazon.in with Lenovo.inBeing a prime member of Amazon.com I can't expect such poor activities.Amazon and Lenovo should take full responsibility to replace this laptop with another model may it will increase in amount about 5k more.I have contacted to Amazon.in but they failed to response me.I believe that selling through advertisement is not at all a success, but customer's satisfaction is the basic tool what is absent in Amazon's recent selling trend.Waiting for early reply and necessary steps from Amazon.in and Lenovo.in."
4,"This product is worth the money spent in terms of hardware configuration. Looks are also good.And the delivery was done before the promised time.I just got the product so not be able to give any feedback on built, performance and durability of the product."
1,"the laptop is not at all how it looks. the material of the laptop is flimsy, the camera quality and sound quality are very bad and the overall look of the laptop is not very nice. Don‚Äôt know why amazon sells such a product and no option to return.. this is absolute cheating and robbery. We bought it for our daughters birthday and this is never going to be a sweet memory"
2,"To start with, incorrect information has been provided. The information states it is ideapad 3i. Well it's only 3 without the i. Considering that, inadequate information was provided by vendor I googled the specs of 3i and purchased this expecting all those specs. However, I was disappointed on receiving the product. While the laptop is fine for my current use for my child school from home and my work from home. I found it to be expensive. To start with the bezel at the bottom is quite thick and laptop looks quite large compared to some of the other laptops in this range. It does not have backlit keyboard which one would expect for this price. The speaker is the biggest disappointment, my Dell laptop has a good speaker. The camera should have been better. There is no lan slot either. All in all, it's expensive at Rs.49K, there one can find better laptops from HP and Dell in this range."
3,"it is kind of square shaped rather than rectangular...Picture and Sound could be sharper ... even with volume 100, it sounds like we are hearing 25% of the volume. the room has to be absolutely silent to hear the videos, youtube or training videos... webcam quality is not good too.. camera privacy shutter is good. ...no other issues found so far...All in all, i find this system expensive to what we get... Lenovo system I brought about 2 years ago was very good compared to this one..."
2,The specifications mention that the battery backup is 7-7.5 hours but it actually works for around 4-4.5 hours even at battery saver mode !! Disappointed.
4,"Laptop seems fairly priced, cheaper options maybe available, but all have regular hard drives and not the SSD.Shelling out extra for the  SSD is worth it.The screen & camera are poor,(given that most of us are used to high resolution on our phones) . but the speed is amazing.Regular boot up and MS office boot ups are spectacularly fast.Laptop is light & sleek. Finish makes it look like a high end laptop.Volume is decent.Comes pre installed with windows and office. Easy to set up hassle free."
1,"Dear TeamWe are sorry to inform you that we purchased  and received  the laptop on 10th July unfortunately  2 weeks after it started giving issue after the part replacement  by Lenovo  service engineer the status is still same,  Amazon  has raised up the hand saying that replacement  window is closed we have to struggle  for getting  this issue resolved"
4,"Laptop is sleek and slim. For the given price point, its s decent laptop. After lot of research, bought this laptop as minimum requirements were 14"" display, 10th Gen Core i5, 512GB SSD & 8GB RAM. Couldn't find a more economic laptop with this configuration.Laptop is good for regular use (not recommended for heavy gaming). There is no backlit keyboard. Laptop comes with lot of lenevo-ware installed. No additional graphics card.Overall a decent laptop as this pricepoint (10th Gen Core i5 + SSD)"
1,"This product was delivered on 1st November , today on 13th day  suddenly the display become blackened.  When checked with Lenovo authorized service center told that the display has to be replaced. later when contacted Amazon customer service center ,they says they are helpless and advised to repair it in the service center.. I am disappointed. I need to replace it .Please don't buy from amazon and such seller who dispose sub quality products .update : now the Lenovo ser center says Mother board is faulty !!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"I am quite satisfied with the product in the price i got around 45K for me.Pros1. Good looks. Slim & lightweight.2. Specs are good, i5 10th Gen, 8GB RAM and 512 SSD.. best u can get at this price.Cons.1. Battery is 3hrs, could have been a bit better 4-5hrs2. Camera is basic3. Screen quality could have been better. But its fine."
4,Bought the Laptop during the Great Indian Festival Sale. Received the item the next day. Satisfied.Two issues I have to flag: It is a IdeaPad Slim 3 and not Slim 3i. Appario Retail needs to correct this as wrong product description amounts to misrepresentation.My Lenovo warranty validity is only for 10 months. Trying to get this to change to 12 months. Emailed Lenovo with all details including Invoice copy and snap of Laptop with serial number. Lenovo has not yet rectified the warranty validity till now.
4,"I have been using this for the last 6 months, didn't write a review because I did not want to mislead people, so I used it first.This is THE QUICKEST laptop, you will come across in this range. It is very light and thus convenient to take it on the go. The Pocket size again makes it very convenient. The audio quality is also Okayish.However, there are always 2 sides of a coin, so you wont much of in built space here, if You are a gamer or a movie buff who likes to keep stuff, probably this is not for you.For office purposes, documentation and light gaming/Movie/Creation, this has to be your go to Piece."
1,"Screen started bleeding all of a sudden.Lenovo service centre asked for photos and made a smart assessment that it was damaged. No idea why we needed such a highly competent service desk to make that assessment.They then ruled on the call itself that damages are not covered by warranty. I wish they could enlighten me on what's the purpose of onsite warranty - no site visit, arrogant template response and no coverage whatsoever.  They wanted me to bring the laptop down to the service centre so that they could confirm their assessment from the comfort of their office.I have been using Lenovo since the 90s. It saddens me to realize that the product and the service have fallen to such low levels. Please do not bother buying these products assuming the old standards."
4,Faster booting
4,"I bough the laptop during the Great Indian sale in October 2020. After about a weeks usage, I am very much happy with the laptop and its performance.The specs mentioned are all correct. i5 10th gen 8 gb ram 512 gb ssd.It has an integrated graphics card and no external one.The laptop only weighs about 1.6kgs and is quite light.There is no backlight nor any fingerprint sensor.It boots very fast in about 10s. Has anti glare screen.Genuine WindowsIt has Microsoft office too and it only has to be activated.But the battery life is quite poor. Doesn't last for more than 4-5 hrs on battery.Overall it's a good deal. I had bght it for around 48k. I believe the laptop is good for that kind of money."
4,Camera Quality is pathetic. Though it says 0.3 MP VGA camera when you actually turn it on you will realise you made a mistake. Don't buy if you intend to use it for online class or video conference for office.Warranty is till September 2021 only.
4,Pretty good product so far. I've been using this for a month now.
1,Spending on Lenovo is waste of money. The laptops are priced at a premium but the quality of the devices are really bad. I had bought couple of them to be used for online classes but both couldn't endure a year. Both were higher configuration ones and the objective to spend on them was for durability. But alas!Don't spend on this company.
1,"It‚Äôs a fake product don‚Äôt buy it, I was working on the laptop all of a sudden there was smoke from the charging slot n the laptop stopped  working I don‚Äôt know how to exchange it as there is not return option"
2,It's just a month before got this product and now the battery stays only for 2hours. Very much disappointed. Keypad is also not that great.
3,"1) There was a punch hole in the box when I received..but I didn't return as it seems not to have damaged the laptop.2) After two days of use, battery life is not that satisfactory.3) Lenovo gave only 9 months warranty."
4,"For rigorous office work, not for gaming"
1,"Within a week of receiving the laptop, it stopped working with AC Adapter. Since then I have been struggling to get a service request registered. Value for money is questionable in my case."
3,Specs are good ..Camera is worst . If you are planning to buy for Online Classes think twice before your buy .Rest is good ...No issues .
1,"Dont buy this product. This gets 0/10 Very low quality, entire body is made of low quality plastic, looks like a duplicate. Raised my concerns with Amazon and asked them to take it back. Now waiting for their response."
3,I purchased two of them in quick succession. The second one is having issues. Camera is not working and battery drains out fast. Looks like I was shipped a defective piece. I have asked for the replacement and awaiting a call back from Amazon. This is my first bad experience with Amazon India.
5,"Screen could have been brighter, performance is on par with an i5 mid ranger. Battery life is decent. The only issue is that the warranty began in Sep 20, hence I get only 10 months instead of 12 months."
4,Works well for all type of functions. Value for money. Sometimes Camera doesn't work for which we need to restart the PC after which it starts working.
1,Waste of money. I am facing issues in this laptop from the date of buying. Each and every time I have to contact a customer support executive to fix it. It is waste of time and money. Within one year the motherboard got damaged and again I am facing issue
4,"Works great , but the plastic body kills the looks !"
5,Every thing is good don't spent more time for research which is best I recommend you check your budget then go for which specifications you required then purchase it this one awsome One  .
1,Hardly been a month . The battery drains out very fast and the camera is not getting switched on. Really trouble some laptop.
5,"Nice product, but prices are frequently fluctuating. It is 1000rs less now"
2,"after exactly 13 months, the battery life quickly died from 3 hrs to 1 hr on full charge"
5,"Fantastic Laptop,Best Laptop under 40k, I contact dell web for delivery but they take minimum 4days of delivery, so I finally purchased on Amazon as same rate as dell website and I received this product on next day,Very good Laptop, i3 10th gen -4GB-250GBM2 type SSD & light weightDue to SSD Boot time is only 8-9 Sec. & Shutdown time takes only 3Sec. 170GB available for Use.You also add SATA Type HDD/SDD (Slot available for this)Windows 10Home & MS-Office home & student (word-excel-Power point) available with this, simple you need to create MS office registration for activation.Display quality is very good and remain same in different angle.Battery Backup is almost 4 to 5hrs, and charger is 45W Fast.Only C type port is not available,I recently updated Windows 10 & Bios, no fan noise is coming from it( Before Update & after Update) Overall Good Product Go for it....."

5,The laptop so far had been really good especially for it's working.. I recommend you to buy this compelling laptop!
3,"Its been an month, continuously using it non stop.For office work its fine, but for students its over priced, as light muti-video editing very easily heats up the laptop and fast drainage. i.e;. Normal Battery Standby mode lasts for 4 to 6 hrs and  8 to 12 hours when kept open( if no apps running in battery save mode and dimmed).. Videos play around 2 to 3 hrs if fully charged..No keyboard light, cannot use outdoor in dark places.. No fingerprint sensors..ROM is low..Bad laptop for gaming..even angry bird game heats it up very easily. Some games run but i would personally not recommend to use it..Faster Boots of 10 to 12 sec (in compare to SDD).Fast screen shut down in 2 sec and overall 4 to 5 sec to full shutdown from inside till re-press power button to start up..Ram upto 1.5gb always in use. 3gb if use means confirm heatup. I would not hold it in my lap..Very good for MS office works and Browsing with good touch gestures.SO ITS DEPENDs ON HOW YOU would use THE APPS. Its a good built laptop. . 32- 35000 rupees i would rate it at maximum..or opt to buy a laptop with better processor.. I have deducted the star because there is no servicing in my area and over price hike in recent month. Its september 2021. But Good laptop."
1,"Bought this once, the headphone jack stopped working, ordered a replacement, the mic in the headphone jack was not working, tried to suck it up and use it anyway since work was more important. Two weeks later, guess what, headphone jack stopped working completely. Again. Never buying Dell ever again."
1,"Received worst product from Amazon ever.. I purchase a dell inspiron15 i3 laptop , and I got laptop with windows 10 pirated version , also having major screen problem..."
5,Just perfect with price.
4,Best laptop in this price for normally users.
5,"cool laptop under this budget,and safe package  thanks AMAZON."
1,No back light in keyboard and camera is bad
5,"Awesome laptop. Quite quick with these specs, thanks to SSD. Works perfect and build is also good."
5,Good product
5,Worth for money performance is good
5,"Nothing to say, It's awesome, super fast laptop, must buy it."
5,Great one. Go for it
1,Laptop started giving issues within 2 weeks. What I feel more concerned about is the lack of ownership displayee by both Amazon and Dell.
5,"I was bit skeptical before ordering it , not because of the specs but for the build quality. Once I received it , all of my confusions went away, the build is sturdy, perfectly suits a gaming laptop look, MSI tried to give it a bit of Alienware look!!Every piece of hardware is superb!! I can bet if you want to buy these specs, it would cost you 95k almost.Just a small complain - about the speaker volume, it could have been a bit louder, but its ok, the sound quality is sweet and smooth and rich, that outweighs the volume loudness. :)"
5,"I was scared to ordered this laptop because there was only single purchased and 0 reviews but I took a risk and now I am happy on my decision as it is true beast . The only con that I feel is the back of the laptop , as the cut design is not visible properly as shown on pics."

5,nice
1,Amazon lies about the specifications.There is only one USB 3.0 port. Rest are USB 2.0. There's no finger print scanner. The screen bleed is unacceptable for the price. The laptop isn't bad but Amazon shouldn't lie on their spec sheet.Edit: returning the laptop. The screen turns yellow on dark and black backgrounds. Way too much screen bleed.
5,"I was surprised to see a Dell gaming laptop at this price (70k). I was extensively looking for reviews for the HP Victus, Acer Nitro 5, Lenovo Ideapad 3 and the Dell G15; and in the end decided to buy this one. My experience so far:1. Build 8/10: It is a bit bit bulky (2.4Kg) and the material used is fully plastic. But the build quality is impressive. The coating is matte and hence no fingerprint smudges could be seen. There is no flex or weird noises when I'm typing on the keyboard. The screen hinge is very solid and there is next to no wobble. The laptop can be opened with one hand.2. Trackpad, Keyboard and speakers 8/10: The trackpad is good with a smooth texture but it is not flush with the palm rest area on one side. The typing experience is decent and the keys are pretty tactile. It comes with a orange backlight with two levels of brightness. One thing I didn't like is the small arrow keys which are present here. The speakers are very loud even at 50-60% which is great for media consumption, however there is not much bass. I think it beats out other gaming laptop speakers at this price.2. Screen 7/10: It is a wva panel with 68% sRGB and 250 nits brightness and has a refresh rate of 120Hz. It's very good for daily tasks and gaming. It has a matte finish so there are no reflections even in low brightness setting. Every brand gives the same display specs at this price so no complaints.3. Performance 9/10: Ryzen 5 5600h is a blazing fast processor giving next to no hiccups when performing moderate to heavy tasks like excel, chrome with multiple tabs open and photo/video editing, etc. There is only 8GB RAM which might be a problem for gaming down the road, but it's upgradable upto 32GB.4. Ports 8/10: It has a decent port selection with 2 USB 3.2 ports on the right side and a 3.2 USB port on the back (amazon needs to update the specs). There is no SD card reader slot if you are planning to use it. HDMI 2.0, Ethernet port and a USB C 3.2 port is also present here.5. Battery life 9/10: For a gaming laptop I was shocked to see such good battery life on the Dell G15. I was working on excel, word, watching youtube videos and Netflix on 60% screen brightness while testing. The battery went from 90-20% in 6-7 hours. This is truly exceptional.Gaming 9/10: I don't play very heavy games in general so I tried out Rocket League, Hitman 2, Genshin Impact and FIFA 21. I was getting more than 120 fps on FIFA, Hitman 2, and Rocket League. I got around 80-90 fps on Genshin impact (All at max settings). I didn't switch on G mode which would have given even better results. The CPU and GPU temperatures were around 75-80 degrees which is pretty normal. But the keyboard and the palm rest area were cool to the touch so no issues there.The only main cons so far are the small arrow keys and the bulkiness of this laptop. It comes only with a 8GB RAM and 512GB SSD which might get full depending on your usage; all brands are only giving this much at this price :/. You can add an extra 512GB and an 8GB RAM if you have the budget.Overall 9/10: Dell G15 Ryzen Edition is a great gaming laptop at this price and apart from it‚Äôs great performance, I feel that the build quality and an excellent battery life puts it above the rest of the competition."
5,"Excellent laptop. All amd hardware gives advantage of smartshift technology. Gaming performance is excellent.Cons:1. Has 4gb x 2 ram o both slots are occupied. To upgrade further, you have to remove both ram ticks and buy 2 new sticks2. Thermals are not upto the mark but for the price i payed(i.e. ‚Çπ74,000) it is acceptable..."
5,"Amazon Specs are not correct. Dell official site has correct specs.1. All the ports are USB 3.2.2. RTX 3050 TGP is 95W after update (was showing 90w before update).2. Battery is 56wh - which is one of the best in gaming laptops under 1 lakh.3. Intels Killer Wifi 6 - best wifi performance (helps in esports games).4. NVMe SSD - 2500MB/s Read speed.5. Single channel 8GB ram stick. (its good actually as it can be upgraded to 16 with 1 more 8GB stick. Some other laptops have 2x4GB, so upgrading to 16 GB means you have to buy 2 new 8GB sticks)."
5,No thermal issues. Good gaming performance. Battery life is good. The only drawback is that the screen brightness is pretty low.
5,"Major usage : Software development , media consumption and casual gaming(only eSports).Extremely good build quality and keyboard. Good battery life. With proper optimizations, it can last around 5-6 hours easily. Extremely good display (compared to my previous laptop) with punchy colours and 120hz screen is a plus. But my bar for a good display is a bit low.Good performance in day to day usage and software development. Docker runs very well but it consumes significant ram. Would suggest to add additional Ram to it.While setting up the laptop, don't connect it to wifi else it'll take a lot of time while setting up. Install all the drivers and updates after setting up the laptop.While playing fifa, the gameplay was extremely smooth and temperature didn't exceed 63 degree while in gmode.1 week usage has been good, will post regular updates for long term use."
3,"We bought the laptop from Amazon. Package arrived safely, no dmg whatsoever.After opening package we find that charger is dirty with dust on it.Laptop: Laptop won't turn on while we tried. We thought that battery maybe drained and charged it full and tried again. It was fine working performance was good after updating the bios.  After turning off laptop and tried to turn ON laptop after few hours,it won't turn on again. Later we find out that we need to attach charger and turn on Otherwise it won't boot. So,we replaced it and found out it was same with the replaced piece. If not for that samll stupid problem, this laptop with ryzen5 and rx 5600m was a beast. Later I totally returned it and bought different lappy."
5,"Overall good ..worth the priceDisplay: amazing with 120hz it's very smooth brightness a little low..I had to keep it at 100% brightness at a well lit room with daylight...it would elswise work fine with 50% brightness in artificially lit room (7.5/10)Keyboard: it's fine too like normal laptop keyboards (6.5/10) the navigation keys are very smallBuild quality - I was just surprised it's so well built so premium looking thing no wobble and no felx (9.5/10)Trackpad - very nice , all gestures are supported so well I just love this earlier I had a dedicated mouse but now I will use this trackpad it's really smooth and takes your multitasking to a next level (9.5/10)Speaker - very much satisfying at this price I generally use earphones so they don't matter much but I tried listening to them on speakers...loudness is not that high ...but the sound quality is very nice you won't face any issue sitting close to it and listening (8/10)Processor - damm nice (10/10)Ram : it says 8 gb idk but on system usable part is only 7.4 gb idk it was with me or its a general optimisation issue that when my laptop was idle still the ram usage was like 50% ...but overall it was managing multi-task nicely (6/10)Battery - it's fine according to a gaming laptop can give you upto 5 hrs on battery saver mode and 3 hrs on non battery saver and you don't game (6/10)Windows 11 runs nicely on this oneThermals : max touched 95 while hardcore gaming the fans were on full speed ..they were a bit noisy but won't matter to you if you are on headphones (7/10)Camera : (8/10)Rest I would update if I find something wroth sharing about this"
4,"Guys if you get this laptop it is a beast in performance and it has a buttery smooth display I think the most surprising part was the battery It lasted for a good amount of time if yr a gamer you need to get this because for what your paying it's worth it .At my house the main problem was No one like the design but I am telling you this laptop is crazy and also the display colour and just amazing if get a chance buy this if you also have a problem with the Design I would suggest go buy ""hp victus ""that also is an crazy laptop that's all from my side check out the picture I shown on top üëÜ you might get an idea ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è"
5,"After so much analysis, I decided to purchase this laptop for mining cryptos. This has been the best interms of value for money which is paid.  Out of box it gives me close to 34MH/s. Really happy with the product. Would purchase few more of this laptop."
5,"This laptop is a beast.It's not 16 gb but 8 gb,512 ssd where get 498gb of storageCan run any modern AAA games without any problem .u can even mine crypto coins with this .if your budget is around 75k-80k buy it without hesitation."
5,"I would recommend this laptop who usually use Dell laptops, as at this sigment you won't get 6gb graphics card (AMD RX 5600M). I have seen more laptops which were over priced but not this one.Other points to be noted:-1. Thermals aren't good but it also depends upon your environment the place you actually work/play games. If you have A/C or you live where it's often cold, thermals will be fine. If that's not your case you can buy a cooling pad which should atleast have 2 or more fans as this actually improved my temperature upto 5¬∞c.2. Screen Bleeding was also there but from my experience if you usually work in low brightness, you would rarely see screen Bleeding it isn't much noticeable.3. When it arrived the BIOS version was 1.7.0 which wasn't stable for gaming as I saw in some reviews that the cpu temperature was clocking more than 96¬∞ c which you can figure out how good is 96¬∞c. Updating to v 1.9.0 stabilizes this issue now it just clocks upto 93¬∞c.4. I would also recommend to buy 16 ram kit as I saw GPU usage and temperature was much low in games.5. In terms of storage options you can add 1 more nvme m.2 ssd upto 2TB.Conclusion:-If you are looking for Dell Gaming laptop which isn't overpriced and full AMD experience, you should buy this as it is worth it."
4,Awesome laptop . Don't buy if your are looking for a cool laptop (overheating a lot). Or slim/good looking one.Apart from that. Nice laptop. Value for money. Performance wise.
5,Getting 60 Fps at 2k... Complete beast value for money... Only problem is heating issue... and delete all Dell software and it is good to go
5,"Nice Laptop for Gaming, editing, streaming"
5,Needed thermal paste change and some pads. Rest the laptop is a beast.
5,(With quirks) @ the budget offered makes complete sense6GB Graphics Memory and 1660Ti level performance with a ~10k < cost differential
4,Overall a very good design and specs but the brightness is a little less but if you‚Äôre not a gamer it would not matter. i rate this 4/5
5,"Best laptop for gamingThe laptop does get heated but it can be reduced by elevating it.Other than that,the performance is best in this price range."
1,The Laptop screen is malfunctioning. Damaged product delivered by Amazon.
5,"It's really a surprise that dell came up with this laptop with amazing specs and such good price point of 70-75k. The laptop is really upto the mark.pros:1. Thermals are good. There is intake vent below the laptop, sides and top of the laptop where speaker grill is expected. The exhaust is at the back. So it works well with cooling pads.2. Alienware command centre is also present.3. The screen is quite good for the price point. Very minimum bezels. 4k and 8k video playback works like a charm.4. Battery life is really amazing. If you dont want to game and just do browsing and movie watching it can give you atleast 8-9hours in one go. I've tested that personally.5. The build quality is really great. It's totally tough, Better than Asus TUF series. Specially the center hinge of the screen is really wide enough and keeps things stable and future proof unlike other brands.6. The customisation: a. Ram - 2 slots, can be upgraded to 32gb as told by store after bios update will be provided. b. NVME - 2 slots c. USB type C for more hubs.7. Charging time: 1.5-2hours with 180W charger.8. Accidental warranty by dell for 3 years cost 6-8k rs only. Other brands only provide 2 years accidental or 1 year accidental with 2 years hardware.9. There is no heating issue. It is foolish to say that it heats even knowing it contains rtx 3050. Rtx 3050 is very powerful and will throw heat on every laptop. But for day to day tasks it does not heat at all. On every gaming laptop heat is dissipated when you use graphic intensive programs. So expect the same in every laptop containing a graphics card.10. Contains wifi 6 and blutooth 5.2. Connection is really great with all the devices. Even the range is better.Cons:1. It's a bit on bulky side. That's only an issue if you use the laptop on your laps for more than 6 hours every day.2. The speaker sound is not loud enough. You can use some equaliser to make it louder, easy fix.3. The charger is a bit bulky as it is 180W."
5,"Nice build quality,nice battery life screen brightness meh..but for gaming a absolute beasti can play cyberpunk,valhalla all at maxed out settings"
4,"If u really want a laptop with 6 gigs of vram, then sure go for it but the thermals will definitely disappoint you."
4,"First of all, the product images in amazon are not totally accurate. The images show a black keyboard with white letters and no fingerprint reader within trackpad. Actual product has silver colored keys with grey letter and there is a fingerprint reader. Refer ASUS official website for correct pics.Things I liked:- Light weight- Bootup and shutdown speeds are good.- Fast fingerprint reader.- Good loud speakers.- Premium look.Things that could have been better..- Display (Viewing angles are not that great. And I observed blue tint. Not sure if this is good for long sessions. I will have to find out.- Keyboard (You cant see the letters on the keys from certain angles or lighting conditions. You will have to lean forward to see the letters. A black keyboard with white letters would have been better)- Camera (Not at all good or I can say useless. I will give 1 out of 5 ratings for Camera)- Left and Right click buttons make cheap clicky sound.Overall I am happy with the product. Giving 4 stars instead of 5, only for the bad camera."
1,I received the laptop in morning didn't start yet after 3 hrs of charging very bad product
5,Excellent
5,"SSD makes function quick. You may or may not add HDD to this lapi along with SSD inside.Internal battery, must be used on battery is drawback.Silver model, I brought. .Delicate, metalic silver keypad no backlight for buttons. cute, delicate buttons.Best for girls, young graceful pretty women like me I would say.I have not played a game, so no comments about.14 inches is fine for my 5 feet body to carry in my hands :)Loved this like anything.. umuuuah :-*Thanks to god for this , This was my 1st big budget shopping on Amazon.Worth it, 3 oct 2021 I brought -sat.

Mindblowing softwares, updates.Ye, you can buy this ! This is my opinion, Go for it :)"
4,GREAT PRODUCT IN THIS PRICE RANGE U CAN SETTLE WITH THIS BUT WOULD HAVE GREAT TO HAVE BACKLIT KEYBOARD AND FAST CHARGING AS IT CHARGES QUICKLY BUT NOT AS FAST CHARGING
3,Appearance and performance is good but camera and the back panel is not good.
4,"All are value for money , only out side cover made mattrial getting low cost."
4,Did not receive the free optical mouse... As mentioned on the product page.
2,Please don‚Äôt buy if you student then you will go for it
4,Not received free mouse pls call
1,camera not working
1,"We order this laptop with replacement options. While doing the order they asked only details for the older laptop like Processor, RAM etc, but when pickup came to take laptop, he rejected my order by telling that older laptop has some scratches on top, lid rubber is loose.Did they mentioned all these details while making the order. They are just here to make people fool.Really bad experience for us. Going forward will not visit this site anymore."
5,Taiwan technologyBest laptopNot made in chinaBest tech in this price.Must buy machineUsing better than dell
1,The display cracked inside after 2 months and Dell service centre says it‚Äôs accidental damage and that it cannot be replaced through warranty. Disgusting
1,MS office 2019 life time free not installed. Microsoft login but payment option open. Laptop not working. Bad item send seller. Replace/Return process not started by seller.
5,Excellent laptop at this price. I don't want to write a detailed review because every thing is good about this laptop..just go for it.
1,Screen blinked and laptop stopped working on first day. Amazon has scheduled experrt visit. Not satisfied with resolution. Want total refund. Duplicate product.
1,"Bought 2 Laptops. One is crashing constantly. Other the Touchpad does not work. Amazon is now selling junk. They have changed replacement policy also, so they will sell Junk to you and then make sure you cannot return it.!!..Now they are corporate thieves"
1,While typing cursor behave absurd . It keeps shifting the places and we are not able to type properly
4,It is a compact 14-inch laptop with lined-texture whole outside. Sound quality and loudness is good. Boot up time is good. Only drawback is brightness management. Even 50% brightness level is not enough sometimes. Pages and new windows open with a less contrast and then in 3-5 seconds it adjusts contrast and becomes normal. I think Dell should fix this. Apart from this it is a good laptop.
5,"Excellent buy, Good Deal by Amazon."
5,Good quality
4,"After going through all reviews, I was lil bit confused but now I am much satisfied with my purchase decision, better than going to a showroom and become prey to them"
3,"Writing this review after using it for 11 months now. I use it for programming. I can say it not good for heavy work like coding, designing, gaming, video editing etc. It is getting hang now and then since couple of months. Please buy only if you need for browsing and working on creating documents like word, excel, powerpoint."

2,Super slow laptop. Pretty bad load times. Keeps hanging while using basic softwares like chrome and ms office. Not recommended
1,Bought it and Replaced twice but still same issue coming up all the time don‚Äôt purchase it now ok bye
4,"I brought the laptop in Great Indian Sale for ‚Çπ50,000. Its been working fine since then. Battery life is good about 7 to 9 hours. Features are Windows 10 OS upgradable to 11, i5 11th Gen, 178 GB usable SSD, MS Office 19. Very sleek and works smooth. The only disadvantage in this laptop is that it doesn't have backlit keyboard so it is difficult to work in low light or in dark. If backlit keyboard is not a requirement then go for it as its a great laptop at reasonable price! Hope the review helps."
4,"**Initial View**In the current market scenario i find this laptop well featured with a good price tag. Build wise good plastic quality. Screen is good with good color accuracy. 11th gen i5 8Gb ram sufficient to handle day to day work. Exchanged my 7 year old HP  i5 4th gen for 13k and got this for around 40k. I am happy with the purchase. I feel its way better than Lenovo Slim series in every respect. I was confused whether to buy this or any 10th gen i5 gaming laptop coming at similar price point(though i don't play any game :-p ) but decided to go with the former for newer gen processor.One thing that was a disappointed me was the lack of backlit keyboard, i specifically asked in Q&A section of product page. The person from manufacturer answered and confirmed of having it. But to my surprise it doesn't have one. This is the one let down of the product to be honest.Overall its a good product. This is my initial view, will post final view after some days of usage."
5,Thanks Appario received as brand new with nice packaging and this dell product is simply best at this price as per my observation..configurations may vary little with other chinese products but DELL is DELL..
5,"This Laptop is good for Daily use, its very quick as it has SSD and i5 11th gen. i7 are more expensive and I do not think its necessary to go into i7 or i9. Although the SSD is having only 256 GB, it can be upgraded if you want or you can always use online cloud storage to store data.The screen quality is very good! It takes only about 15 seconds to start and the battery lasts quite long and charges fast.  The ram can be upgraded from 8 gb to 16 if needed but its still good at 8gb. The screen size is 15.6 which is going to a plus again.  You will not even hear the fan running unless you do some heavy task such as copying data and it remains cool most of the timeIn my opinion, Dell is way better than other brands,  even if you might not get the backlit keyboard or fingerprint sensor, are these really needed? Considering utility, durability, this laptop is very nice and a must buy for someone who has regular use.There is also an antivirus subscription for 15months included, amazon audible included etc.If you want something sleek and simple, this is a good option! Go for it!For Gamers: I am sorry I can not give you any advise :D there are exclusive laptops meant for you which may be more powerful, so,  maybe you can find more about those before thinking of this one for gaming.I did not initially see the reviews for this laptop on Amazon, but I think that a review can help someone to make the right choice, so I just wanted to share my opinion :)There are some other variants in this model such as 1TB hard drive + SSD . If you need more storage, you can go for that variant."
1,I just brought this new laptop by 20th oct for personal use. In 5 days only top layer screen has broken. You can see in images. It seems it is not tested property with new design. Now situation is I can't close the screen as it is keep on breaking. I am not able to understand how to use warrenty.
4,This laptop is good for its price and specs. Super fast and no fan noise. Little heating issue on the top side. Overall perfect for business and coding as good ram and processor.  Buy it blindly‚Ä¶ good keypad and display.

3,Battery life is good. Works for 6+ hours once fully charged. Display is nice with update to Windows 11. Facing heating issues since day one- upper strip on keyboard between keyboard and Display gets quite hot. Would love to keep it if not for the heating issue.

5,"I have both Dell Vostro 3490 & Lenovo IdeaPad S145. AMD Ryzen performance, 8GB & SSD Harddisk gives a better response & performance. I would say value for money. Go for it. Both come with similar price tags but Dell got 4GB, SATA HDD which impacts the performance in a big way."
1,This looks very cheap quality laptop and don't take risk to buy this it is totally weste of money. Thanks you
4,"When i bought this it was having a 1 star rating and that too by 1 rater. Not convincing right? But then i found the same laptop listed on flipkart at a higher price and much higher rating. Though the configuration always attracted me but it was lack of interest on amazon which was keeping me at a distance. Seeing the flipkart, i quickly grabed it and found the laptop as expected. I am not an expert but it is an overall nice deal. Got it exchaged for my 11 year old pentium and final price around 23.5k. issues like weight a bit higher despite no cd drive, keys positioning, user memory available showing around 3gb, low audio and mcafee trial ver."
5,I am doing research from one month for buying a laptop and after all the hustle my luck bring me to this laptop. My genuine suggestion to all who want to buy anything just wait for right time and keep patience you will definitely get a good deal . By keeping patience and waiting for right time I got this laptop for the least possible price .And I don't think I have to tell you about the specs of this product you already know it.So coming to the main point!! it's BATTERY BACKUP== From 100 to 0 it gives me 5 hours while watching Mirzapur through WiFi .That's all.Try to buy anything during sales whether buying it in normal daysBelieve me you will save Thousands ‚Çπ‚Çπ‚Çπ‚Çπ.

Great Deal"
5,i bought this laptop when there was no review . i am the first person who purchased this laptop from amazon . i was very scared about this laptop but this is the best best laptop . and it's best for gaming also it has 2 gb video ram . i am using form 2 weeks and it's very fast and very very awsome laptop . battery is also awsome . it's gives 5 hour back in normal use and while gaming i gives 3 hour back. it's come with mcafee antivirus i month free trial and i purchase 1 year mcafee subscription in just 269 rupee and it's best antivirus.
5,"Its One of the Best Budget Laptop you could get it, I got it at 28.7k during Happiness Upgrade Days,Pros:-*8 GB Ram and SSD OF 256 GB (U will get around 197 GB to use)*MS Office can be activated for lifetime by registering Microsoft Account*Battery is Pretty Good, it Depends on usage ,For normal usages u get around 4.5 hours on various Usages (thats enough for all the students and Professional  works)*display and Sound looks Ok üòä*Outer Body is made of plastic, should be handled carefully*Camera not so good : if good lighting condition are there u could get good clarity, in dim light u expect a  good one* Keyboard  and Track pad is awesome to typeCons :-*Camera should be improved in Lenevo laptops, is not upto the mark (for the price ok.)*should have provided additional slot for HDD expansionIt's based on first impression, will update after few weeksGo for it Better than dell and  Hp with respect to Price and specs*Ryzen 3 better than what i expected."
1,Some of the keys of the keyboard are not working. And amazon arranges technical support after a weeks time. Decision will be taken after that. Sorry for inconvenience is what they say.I approached a Dell authorised service centre and rectified it. Its better to p purchase laptops from authorised store's than Amazon.  The price is hardly different.
5,Performance is mediocre. Boot times are blazing fast. Install linux and enjoy it's full potential. I personally tried Pop_OS and it runs like a charm. You can play old titles and some light weight games. Don't expect high framerates in AAA titles. But old games like GTA 5 are playable with around 40 fps in low 720p. All in all a good buy and Lenovo's thermal management with AMD chips is very nice. I could hardly hear the fan ever get loud enough to be audible even under heavy workloads like gaming.
3,"It worked fine/well for almost 11 & half months (though the battery never delivered what was promised).Now, it starts, power LED blinks for 3 times almost, and then suddenly shut down.Nearby exclusive store diagnosed a motherboard issue and asked to visit New Tirupati Cellular in Pimpri, says he is an authorised dealer.I hope they repair it at earliest.I will further add about LENOVO SERVICE EXPERIENCE once I go thru it. Thanks"
3,"Don't buy ,it's my sincere request to all not to buy laptop online ,spend little extra cash and buy from the store , just 3 days after buying the laptop my laptop has hanged . MS office is on trial basis for a month after that I will have to buy the software and same thing is with the antivirus . This was my first time buying a laptop online and this would be my last , if a thing that cost 35-40k and it's hanging just 3 days after purchasing , Amazon is making a Fool out of us ."
5,"Really a value for money Laptop, Very slim and light weight. If you plan to buy a laptop go for any laptop but with below specification1. AMD processor ( Ryzen 3 or higher)2. You must have SSD storage (enjoy super speed)3. 8 GB RAM minimumPls note all the above should come for 30k (+/- 2k) then you are going on a right choice.Also look at the battery power (good one should have 6 Hours backup)"
5,"Bought it during Great Indian sale in October 2020. Among all the laptops within 30k price range this is undoubtedly the best one. Don't go for 1TB HDD version instead choose 256GB SSD even if the storage is low. You will thank me in the long run. You can upgrade your storage later if you want.Pros:15.6-inch full hd screenfull-length keyboarddecent battery life256GB SSD comes on m.2 slot which is great if you want to upgrade your storage as the 2.5inch slot is emptyCons:the camera is 0.3mp, poor qualityno backlit keyboard"
4,"Best laptop in this price range, good and premium look, enough RAMof 8GB. Little short with storage. Battery backup is average.1. Premium look2. 8GB ram3. 256 SSD4. MS officeCons1. Average battery backup- 4 hours2. No USB 3.03. No ethernet port4. Camera quality - not that good.5. Display view angle is less."
4,"Brought at 30k, worth buying at this price.Reviewing after 1 year of usageüòÇ.Working fine and maintained it's fastness.laptop boots in 6 to 10 seconds.Batery backup is around 4 hours now.Had issues with keys, after 9 month of purchase.Contacted lenovo service and had hassle free service from Lenovo.Keyboard replaced under warranty onsite that to in  tier 3 city.It is eligible for free windows 10 upgrade."
5,¬∞>Very good product.... Its quality is very good and it looks like metal body but it is plastic...¬∞> runs smooth touch response is good¬∞> on the very first day i charged it 100 % and then  i wanted an movie and played some games and its battery backup is excellent it gave a backup of 5 hrs.. Good enough¬∞> I will suggest u if it seem ms office is not Preinstall no worry... Directly contact lenovo customer care they will help u and amazon will just say toh refund on replace..
5,*Best Laptop under this Budget .*It is for  daily use laptops  .*But fast accessing*Battery level only three to four hours*But if u want to buy laptop under 30000Choose this laptop
3,"Reviewing after a month of useValue for money, good performance as expected from ryzen 3 , boots up in 15 sec ,Gaming - GTA V 30fps @ 720p enjoyable , 20fps @ 1080p beautiful but not playable.Valorant - 55-65 fps (max 76fps)Photoshop working good , blender lags & isn't good for extended work session , android studio running good , build quality is not good , camera is bad"
4,"Got the laptop yesterday for around 31k, Overall good laptop look wise good it boots really fast for me it take 5-6 seconds .But the camera and sound quality is not as good so these two are the cons which can be improved in the actual price of 42k ."
5,This is an awesome product and well packaged.The laptop is working well. There is no sound produced by the fan. The booting speed is quite well. The performance of the laptop is awesome.The quality of the product is good. The battery life is very good and it stands up to four to five hours. The screen is not bad but that doesn't matter. This laptop is good at this price. 30k.
4,"After doing research on internet, I selected this product and it is amazing with high speed of processing and response. Under budget, it is best laptop with 8gb ram and ssd making it a lot fast speed machine. If you are thinking for i3 then you can also consider ryzen 3. I got this laptop at price of 31k."
5,"I have been using this for 3 weeks now for official purpose. And my experience is excellent compared to price of the laptop, it is fast and light weight.If you use web cam a lot then it dosent have a good camera..other things are totally fine."
5,First of All A Good Product From Lenovo with such Amazing Specs !Pros :Performance : 4.5/5Battery :4/5 (4.5 - 5 hours Normal Usage)Display 4.5/5Build Quality : 4/5 ( Plastic Build )Speakers : 4.5/5Keyboard : 4/5*Cons*Trackpad : 3.5/5Camera : No RatingsNo Type C port and RJ45 Port !
5,"Good packing & i got genuine product, Thanks Amazon..."
4,Slightly on the bulky side for those who prefer lightweight laptops. But good value for money as combination of Ryzen processer and SSD disc is value for money for everyday task and normal office work. We use it for mostly editing in Word and it performs effortlessly on that front.
4,"The product is good, light weight having around 4 hrs battery life.speed is also fine but this product has very less sound.The only negative point is its sound.you can not enjoy any moview without head phone or a sound bar."
1,Never buy lenovo laptop. Only in 11 months without much usage laptop not working properly. And lenovo customer service for repair is pathetic. 14 days have been gone since i have made a service request on lenovo customer support website but till date no solution at all. They don't care what you have gone through. Don't buy lenovo laptop otherwise you will surely regret on your decision.
5,"Really amazing product at this price range, I loved the design and it's battery life.its good light multitasking as well! I have been using from 5 days, and I didn't found a single problem with respect to performance!"
3,only 190 GB Usable from 256gb SSDonly 6 GB RAM Usable from 8GB RAMwebcam totally scrapAverage battery.
2,Ms Office was not pre-installed. Although while purchasing the product it was clearly mentioned it would be pre-installed. It was confirmed by Lenovo technical support.
4,The product is very good. I have give 4 stars because the camera quality is not good. If this can be fixed I'll be happy as my job requires a better cam.My organisation's tech personnel had advised me to buy this. It's working well!
5,Best laptop under this budget performance of the laptop is very good suitable for daily usages but  not for heavy gaming  over all it is a good laptop
1,"This review is based on my purchase of Microsoft Surface Pro 4. The device in itself is very useful, but it has the worst issues with respect to hardware. I have replaced 4 Surface Pro and in March-20, the device again started with flickering issue. Please note that as on today (06Aug20), the device is not yet replaced even though the company claims replacement in 7 days. It is a nightmare when you are using it as a primary device.As mentioned earlier about the device replacement, note that when it comes to customer service, it is worst in India. the toll free number as usual never connects & if you chat, agents are sitting out of India and they don't know anything about service centers in India. The service center does not offer any help at all.Please do not waste money in this device. You may check out via normal google search about the issues with Surface devices. There will hardly be any positive comment."
1,m3 processor is still better at that price. intel gold processor at 55000 rupees is too much for it.
1,Pathetic pricing
1,different product received it ipad inMicrosoft box
4,"This is surface go 2.. some mix up in the descriptionDevice is awesome. Premium feel.Charges fast. Speed is good. No lag even with 10 tabs open in Microsoft edge browser with few other applications open. Can't jump to other apps easily in android tab or an ipad. Still using s mode. So no Google apps, no Adobe reader. Restricted app store. Type c port doesn't charge.My needs fulfilled."
1,"It's a waste of money. You cannot use it for most common purposes like installing google chrome, kindle app etc let alone programming. Disabling the S of the Windows heats up the device and makes it slow. Since it cannot be returned, need to find how to use it."
2,"Update # 1 september. The device is already dead and sent for warranty repair leaving my all my works pending.Poor choice my fault.... touch interface is not at all intuitive. To close a browser tab have to press 4 - 5 times. The default sleep option is horrible. It sometimes requires a reset as one click on the power button after sleep won't turn it on. Many may panic and think the PC is dead. The PC gets heating up horribly if you run any graphics related apps (even thr normal ones). And who uses DDR III at after 2019. Its madness. To top it all, windows 10 keeps releasing updates almost every week or fortnight squeezing every bit of your net pack. The only silver lining is its weight and portability. Constrained to buy windows PC for the sole reason that it supports productive apps more than other OS platforms. My bad."
1,"Exchange offer never works.. I mean never. I've tried twice to exchange with my Surface pro 2 i5. It's in excellent working condition. But pick up boy will just cancel. Once pick up boy just canceled without even coning to me. They're worried, in  the office they might get rejected. Very bad systems. Microsoft is giving us the opportunity to exchange and upgrade but Amazon is not able to execute the exchange transition.  I was barred to give reviews for surface. I've got 3 surface so far. I'm used to it that's the only reason I'm in to it..."
1,The product stopped working after 1 month of use. And neither Microsoft nor Amazon did anything about it. They just raised their hands and they said they can‚Äôt help me. I am so disappointed and I regret buying this product and from Amazon
1,God know why we bought this. Pathetic item and utter waste of money.. no good apps in this so can‚Äôt use like Apple or android tabs.Heating issue.Windows on small screen is no use for office work.So overall since we have bought this. Kept as display only and rarely used. Don‚Äôt go by YouTube video bloggers.. this is utter waste even for frequent travellers who works outside office.
5,"Price worthy. I don't think anyone should compare it with I pad air or samsung galaxy tab s6 , as all of them have different operating systems. One who is not very much fond of gaming may purchase it over others."
5,"The size, weight and speed are all just right- especially if you are able to supplement it with the keyboard that comes separately. I was not able to see much utility for the pen, which I had bought as well- it has also been a little more difficult to learn to use. No regrets on any front."
4,Its a product for students it is easy to use and It is smooth. Overall a nice product.
5,Works really well for me as I wanted a tablet that can also be a laptop on demand...
5,It‚Äôs the most trendy utilitarian device that you can ever get
2,My Laptop mic problem..sound not clear
5,Wow Superb as per my need
4,Did not get the latest processor and LTE
1,"this is not surface go 2,surface go 2 is 10.5 inch display"
1,"If microsoft wants their product to be a hit, then they have to price it same as usa pricing. Otherwise in india it will be a big flop."
3,"Cons-1- This laptop is way too expensive for a Pentium‚Ñ¢ gold Processor.2- The Sound is ok , but not the best.3- I would recommend to buy the ""Asus Vivobook Flip 14"" if you do want the touch screen4- The 64Gb storage model has EEMC storage , which is extemely slow.5- The screen is very small for a laptop.6- Not good for Programing .Pros-1- The Webcam is One of the best at this price.2- The battery life is Great.3- The screen quality is very nice.4- The surface pen works great5- The colour is nice6- Very portable"
1,Microsoft surface series is the worst that you can ever buy.I have a surface pro4 and the screen flickering issue is so bad that you can't work on it for more than 2 hours.If you want a cool looking device just to show off and not work on.. go for it. But if you really want a gadget to use... Just don't buy any product from Microsoft.
1,Go for lenovo flex or hp envy if possible .this product should be priced around 30-35k.Bad product from Microsoft
1,"Don't buy this. This laptop is being sold at a premium of almost 15k in India when compared to the US price. No idea who thought that was a good idea. You can import it for cheaper. Seriously, skip it."
1,No keyboard why u r calling it as laptop? Laptop consists of keyboard. It us just accessories.Go for many orherbrand far better than this
5,"Good product, but the accessories are hard to find in local market. Battery life is good 8hr or so."
5,"After my 13inch MacBook I have tried several window laptops HP, Dell, Asus, Acer but this is first laptop that has amazed me with its extreme engineering design and a display to die for, stunning colours and best sound ever on a laptop, this beats MacBook retina display anyday and fast charge is amazing. I think it should be priced at 80k but surprisingly it's being sold at 69,999. The ports are more than adequate, the thunderbolt port and charging via USB is cherry on cake, fast charge, hdmi usb 3.2 port, only thing I felt was ram 8gb is just okay. You will forget hp, Lenovo and Dell and now I felt cheated on getting those mediocre specs and quality of laptops at 80k. You will not regret a bit once you hold this piece of beauty in your hands. WiFi 6 BT 5. Close your eyes and go for this you will love it and will become your routine companion. I have gray colour one and it's best. Fully recommend this laptop. Thanks Vaio for this amazing device."
1,"I had vaio gifted by my company. It only takes 8months for the screen hinge to break apart. The customer service is horrible. They take several months to change it. By the time the hinge is replaced the warranty/ guarantee is over. Now starts the fun. 3more months the hinge breaks again :D . The repair cost is extremely high. Its a flimzy laptop, Very delicate. You will notice when u have your hands on the laptop. The speed is also not great!"
5,It‚Äôs an amazing product. I have not used such a fast laptop before. Everything happens so fast that it‚Äôs unimaginable. The setup is also very fast. I will recommend this for everyone.The only glitch I have is that the office 365 as promised on the site is not available and I didn‚Äôt get the key to activate it. I have written to vaio and still awaiting response.
4,This is not the VAIO that I am used to - but it has all features for my day to day needs . It is value for money for everyday business use . Light weight and fast . Keyboard is not as sleek as the old Vaio's Beware of  Office 365 license : I have not been provided activation key for Office 365 which was a part of the deal.  Service response from VAIO is not fast. I am not sure why they advertised and charged for the Office 365
5,"I am using vaio laptop not this model ryzen 5( purchased 2 month ago ) and i feel best laptop according performance and smoothness of workgrate looks ,screen &fast.specially their service - once i call service centre technician came to my house (they have 2 years home service )"
5,Overall nice laptop with good performance and good battery backup. Speaker sound is low. Display is good with fast finger print sensor.
4,Product is ok.but Microsoft account can be set up with product key code.Pl send same immediately.shall try and then only comment
1,The worst laptop ever. New issues everyday. I regret buying this. Never buying sony again. Better go for some other brand.
3,It is mentioned that screen size  is of 14inch...but in reality it is of 12inch only...keyboard is getting heated while using it for just 2min
5,"Fingerprint scanner works great, upgraded the windows from 10 to 11- beta build. works like charm.Battery backup is awesome i easily get 1 day battery backup with light to moderate use."
1,PRODUCT NOT WORKING
5,Battery life and performance  is pretty good........build quality is excellent  ....I hv been using  this from past one month it looks osm
5,"Everything is great from boot up time to build quality. Additional security chip, and nvme storage(found in macbooks)."
1,"It comes with wifi 5 and not wifi 6, Confirm exact specs before buying. Been trying trying to contact dell via questions here or by call and chat, sometimes they call me back saying they will send me exact spec sheet but they dont. No one in their company has specific answers, or they dont want to answer.Also beware of battery capacity, other websites say 4 cell battery with 54 whr, while the specs here say 3 cell ‚Äò2.6 whr‚Äô battery.EDIT: I brought the laptop, this exact model from amazon (D552192WIN9S) i can confirm it has wifi 5 (ac) and a 54 watt hour battery. Comes with lifetime validity of 2019 home and student office pre installed and a 30 day mcafee trial."
5,"Omg! What a beast performer and what a beauty. That subtle body is so soothing. That fingerprint reader is so damn fast. Good implementation of soft touch material in the palm resting area near the touchpad. Even extended warranty along with premium care is so cheaper yet better than HP counterpart.Only thing is I wish the machine had auto backlight keyboard timeout i.e. it doesn't automatically turn off the backlit keyboard after some time. If it's on, it will stay on till the laptop goes into sleep. It's okay, it doesn't matter to me.The best thing is that the weight distribution and the vents have been done so well on this device, that it feels lighter than even a 14 inch laptop and doesn't ever gets hot.P.S. beast devices need beast care. Purchase extended warranty along with premium care for this device from Amazon (TPS Technologies) and you can breathe in peace as the extended warranty is directly provided by Lenovo.Overall, it's the best Value for Money device I could have got at this price range. Thank you Lenovo and Amazon ( for delivering within a day and understanding my urgency). Love ‚ù§Ô∏è"
4,"I'm reviewing the product after using it for 1 week. So no idea about long term usage or customer care service.Pros:Performance: 16GB RAM is more than enough. You can't think more of this. It's damn fast. I tested it by working with 30 apps simultaneously. It worked very smoothly. Also thanks to the latest 11th gen i5 processor. The Boot Speed is also awesome. Thanks to SSD. Overall I'm quite fascinated with the performance of the CPU.Graphics: Decent for your everyday work. It has Intel's Iris Graphics Card. (Not recommended for gamers)Speakers and Microphone: Both are nice. Good bass and quality. But it's not so loud. For proper sound you always need to have max volume. It could have been better and more powerful. Microphone has a decent noise cancellation system.Keyboard: The quality of the keys are very nice.  Contains backlit keyboard. It has separate number pad keys which is very useful. The keyboard arrangement is very good.Battery: On standby it gives 8hrs of battery life. Meanwhile for me, on average online classes it gives at least 3hrs of battery.Fingerprint Reader: Quite decent. No less than a mobile's fingerprint scanner. Opens up instantly.Charging: It supports rapid charging. Takes around 1hr to charge the laptop completely, which is very good.Display: It has a 15.6 inches FHD IPS anti-glare screen, which is decent. The size of the screen is more than enough, it seems bigger than you imagine. It has very narrow sided bezels which increases the screen size ratio. Smoothly runs 8k videos. Average resolution is also good.Lenevo's inbuilt features and tips and tricks are quite good. Has useful shortcut function keys. System customisation features are decent. The thing that I found interesting is that as soon as you open the laptop it switches on automatically. You don't have to press the power button. This feature is known as Flip Switch. You can turn it off in the settings. Doesn't have any bloatware or pre-installed apps. Comes with the Microsoft Office 2019 package.Cons:Camera: Could have been better. It has 0.9mp and the picture resolution is average. Not a good camera. Doesn't look good during online meetings.Doesn't support HDR, 12K resolution, Windows Hello.Battery: When the battery is very low, like 10%, it drains very fast. Battery conservation is average.Touchpad: Average. Sometimes it doesn't recognise your finger gesture. A little high sensitivity.Non Upgradable: You can't add additional RAM sticks or Graphics Card because it's already soldered onto the motherboard."
5,"Likes:Intel 11gen processor - lightning speed.DDR4 16GB RAM at peak speed.Wifi 6.Very fast boot up.Great battery - approx 8 hours.Fingerprint login - fast and secure.Comes with MS-office license.Front facing speakers and hence unhindered good sound.Backlit keyboard with separate numpad (like desktop keyboard)Dislikes:Lenovo apps - would have preferred clean windows. Though no noticeable hindrance from these.Would prefer separate keys for Home, End, Pgup and Pgdn instead of clubbing with Fn+arrow keys for these; though manageable with same keys in numpad."
1,"My first buy of any Lenovo product and probably the last one....!!I'm writing this review after 3 months of use and believe me this doesn't deserve your hard earned money.After just a month's use I stared facing issue with USB ports, system getting crashed while working, keyboard/trackpad/entire device getting hanged all of a sudden and the only way out is to turn it OFF manually. The device also gets restarted automatically without any reason. Even after the device is SHUT DOWN I'm facing the issue of battery getting drained completely automatically.I've tried to receive support from Lenovo Technical Support team but they also failed to address the issues, as the issues keep on recurring even after the fixes every now and then.I also contacted Lenovo Customer Support Team for replacement of my product after like 50 days of usage as the issues were recurring evry now and then and the Technical Support Team wasn't able to resolve it permanently and believe me they have the worst Support Team. They are replying me that since the product is not meeting their DOA guidelines they won't be able to repalce it, and adivised me to contact their Technical Support Team for the issues.So, please guys don't waste your money on this product as Lenovo won't be able to provide you with appropriate support and neither will it address your greviances."
1,Just unpack and screen is smaller than shown in item description.No numpad.I3 instead of i5No fingerprint scanner.Scratch on outer bodyHave not on the laptop and reviewed the RAM and other details.Very disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è
1,"Received damaged product. Selected replacement next day with techni visit schedule, no one came, tagged Amazonian on twitter, a call came, damage photo uploaded on link sent by Amazon, again tech visit scheduled, no one came. Replacement window over"
5,Super laptop Speed is very fast ‚è©
5,"One of the best laptops  . Love the build quality , fast boot thanks to the SSD.  Finger print sensor works great as well.Battery lasts easily 6-7 hours.Before buying check out the configurations as there are several  available.  Preferably buy one with the max RAM configuration as there is no option to upgrade RAM later. Also check out how much storage you want. I went for a 512 GB SSD configuration which is good enough,  but one can consider the 1 TB HDD and 256 GB SSD.."
5,"I was skeptical at first buying laptop from online shopping, but received it well packaged in carton box. Performance is good enough. Not producing much heat. Fan sound is also not audible. I recommend this one as it comes with optimized configuration."
4,"If you are interested in using some heavy softwares for engineering this will be an ideal laptop and can run these softwares smoothly and can run more than one software at once without much lag It's very comfortable to use.Light weight and boots very fast in a few secondsNowadays manufacturers are soldering the RAM slots , so if you are looking for a 16 GB configuration,this is a cheap alternative to the laptops which cost more than 1 lakhGraphics is not very good and so might not be suitable for gaming"
5,"Really very fast n sleek lappy. Likes: so sleek, wide display 15.6cm, Intel core i5 11th gen processor, only SSD in place of HDD making it even faster, fast fingerprint sensor, wifi 6, backlit keyboard, life time MS office 2019, upgraded to Windows 11 home in just 15 minutes, good for online classes and video editing, fast charging, power back up of up to 8 hours, and many more.Dislikes:- Absolutely nothing.An amazing purchase n very good packaging. Really happy. Thanks team Amazon."
5,"In same budget HP was giving same configuration with 14"" but I went with 15.5"" and it is worth.Camera could had been better.Performance wise excellent."

But it's ok as we see there is hike in the market for all laptopsMany hot keys makes my life simpler, like calculator sniping volume controls etcThough it looks sleek, it's bit heavy to hold.Overall good to have personal laptop.I didn't use it for gaming so no views on that"
5,"Fast boot. Amazing auto start feature when opened up. Good 300 Nits FHD display Great Dolby sound quality. Nice shutter feature for camera. Lightweight. Core i5 11 gen processor, 16 GB Ram, 512 GB SSD, 2.4 GHz Freq. combination give ultimate performance. Good decision and happy with the purchase."
5,I am using this laptop for past couple of months. It is awesome.
5,"Compact device with good screen size and clarity for work and academics. Appreciable processor and RAM speeds. Practically Light weight. Good variety of connections with USB and USB 3, HDMI, card readers etc. Original windows with upgrade option and MS office is good."
3,Received my laptop 2 days back. It's avg looking laptop.Pro: a.Good configuration at given price for this brand.b. No over heating till date.c. Fingerprint is quick.Cons: a. keyboard casing is made of avg plastic material. Entire keyboard panel bends significantly when pressed from both corners^. I fear some day hinge will break out of this body pack.b. USB-C PD is mentioned but it's not letting me charge laptop with my superdart 65w mobile charger. Lenovo support are clueless of solution.
1,Software not working. Totally disappointed at poor resolution
4,Laptop 40 is very nice and build is very nice and look is very nice and its performance is very nice It will be switched on within few seconds fingerprint reader is very responsive and Windows 10 is upgradable to Windows 11 the overall experience is very nice size suggest you to buy this as ssd has a more good performance
2,"I used the laptop for 24 hours, then windows auto update got executed post which the laptop is not responsive. Doesn't accept and execute any commands. Bad experience. Not sure who is responsible-Microsoft or Lenovo."
5,The laptop is with all features as specifed. It working fine.
1,Very bad.Seal tampered. Logged in with another user name
4,Its good but as they stated Dolby digital etc etc...Sound is very very low...
5,Excellent laptop and got it at a very good price point.

5,Awesome product
1,Received defective laptop. so returned it
3,"Specifications are good at this price.And boot time is 5 sec.Performance is extremely good.All software are run fastly.But built quality poor, laptop hole made of plastic.To reduce cost, they compromise with quality, :--1) plastic built2) camera is only 0.3 MP so it was very very bad.3) no backlit keyboard4) no type-c port5) no face unlock6) low battery backup 3 hr7) blurry screenOut of 8 GB ram 2 GB occupied by its integrated graphics, so only 6 is usable."
5,"I have both Dell Vostro 3490 & Lenovo IdeaPad S145. AMD Ryzen performance, 8GB & SSD Harddisk gives a better response & performance. I would say value for money. Go for it. Both come with similar price tags but Dell got 4GB, SATA HDD which impacts the performance in a big way."
1,This looks very cheap quality laptop and don't take risk to buy this it is totally weste of money. Thanks you
4,"When i bought this it was having a 1 star rating and that too by 1 rater. Not convincing right? But then i found the same laptop listed on flipkart at a higher price and much higher rating. Though the configuration always attracted me but it was lack of interest on amazon which was keeping me at a distance. Seeing the flipkart, i quickly grabed it and found the laptop as expected. I am not an expert but it is an overall nice deal. Got it exchaged for my 11 year old pentium and final price around 23.5k. issues like weight a bit higher despite no cd drive, keys positioning, user memory available showing around 3gb, low audio and mcafee trial ver."
5,I am doing research from one month for buying a laptop and after all the hustle my luck bring me to this laptop. My genuine suggestion to all who want to buy anything just wait for right time and keep patience you will definitely get a good deal . By keeping patience and waiting for right time I got this laptop for the least possible price .And I don't think I have to tell you about the specs of this product you already know it.So coming to the main point!! it's BATTERY BACKUP== From 100 to 0 it gives me 5 hours while watching Mirzapur through WiFi .That's all.Try to buy anything during sales whether buying it in normal daysBelieve me you will save Thousands ‚Çπ‚Çπ‚Çπ‚Çπ.
4,"Machine is little flimsy. Performance is good as it is loaded with ryzen 3200u, 8gb, NVMe.SSD. It took me by surprise on my first boot the key strokes didn't work. Audio is merely audible. Overall OK for simple everyday use."
4,"Pros:High Performance, definitely better than Intel I3Integrated Graphics, one can easily play games at medium settingsBuild Quality is greatKeyboard layout that too a full length keyboardScreen size and quality at this price pointSSD at the priceCons:Camera! 0.3 MP VGA, that's itNo backlit keyboardBattery could have been improvedOverall, go for this laptop. Great Deal"
5,i bought this laptop when there was no review . i am the first person who purchased this laptop from amazon . i was very scared about this laptop but this is the best best laptop . and it's best for gaming also it has 2 gb video ram . i am using form 2 weeks and it's very fast and very very awsome laptop . battery is also awsome . it's gives 5 hour back in normal use and while gaming i gives 3 hour back. it's come with mcafee antivirus i month free trial and i purchase 1 year mcafee subscription in just 269 rupee and it's best antivirus.
5,"Its One of the Best Budget Laptop you could get it, I got it at 28.7k during Happiness Upgrade Days,Pros:-*8 GB Ram and SSD OF 256 GB (U will get around 197 GB to use)*MS Office can be activated for lifetime by registering Microsoft Account*Battery is Pretty Good, it Depends on usage ,For normal usages u get around 4.5 hours on various Usages (thats enough for all the students and Professional  works)*display and Sound looks Ok üòä*Outer Body is made of plastic, should be handled carefully*Camera not so good : if good lighting condition are there u could get good clarity, in dim light u expect a  good one* Keyboard  and Track pad is awesome to typeCons :-*Camera should be improved in Lenevo laptops, is not upto the mark (for the price ok.)*should have provided additional slot for HDD expansionIt's based on first impression, will update after few weeksGo for it Better than dell and  Hp with respect to Price and specs*Ryzen 3 better than what i expected."
1,Some of the keys of the keyboard are not working. And amazon arranges technical support after a weeks time. Decision will be taken after that. Sorry for inconvenience is what they say.I approached a Dell authorised service centre and rectified it. Its better to p purchase laptops from authorised store's than Amazon.  The price is hardly different.
5,Performance is mediocre. Boot times are blazing fast. Install linux and enjoy it's full potential. I personally tried Pop_OS and it runs like a charm. You can play old titles and some light weight games. Don't expect high framerates in AAA titles. But old games like GTA 5 are playable with around 40 fps in low 720p. All in all a good buy and Lenovo's thermal management with AMD chips is very nice. I could hardly hear the fan ever get loud enough to be audible even under heavy workloads like gaming.
3,"It worked fine/well for almost 11 & half months (though the battery never delivered what was promised).Now, it starts, power LED blinks for 3 times almost, and then suddenly shut down.Nearby exclusive store diagnosed a motherboard issue and asked to visit New Tirupati Cellular in Pimpri, says he is an authorised dealer.I hope they repair it at earliest.I will further add about LENOVO SERVICE EXPERIENCE once I go thru it. Thanks"
3,"Don't buy ,it's my sincere request to all not to buy laptop online ,spend little extra cash and buy from the store , just 3 days after buying the laptop my laptop has hanged . MS office is on trial basis for a month after that I will have to buy the software and same thing is with the antivirus . This was my first time buying a laptop online and this would be my last , if a thing that cost 35-40k and it's hanging just 3 days after purchasing , Amazon is making a Fool out of us ."
5,"Really a value for money Laptop, Very slim and light weight. If you plan to buy a laptop go for any laptop but with below specification1. AMD processor ( Ryzen 3 or higher)2. You must have SSD storage (enjoy super speed)3. 8 GB RAM minimumPls note all the above should come for 30k (+/- 2k) then you are going on a right choice.Also look at the battery power (good one should have 6 Hours backup)"
5,"Bought it during Great Indian sale in October 2020. Among all the laptops within 30k price range this is undoubtedly the best one. Don't go for 1TB HDD version instead choose 256GB SSD even if the storage is low. You will thank me in the long run. You can upgrade your storage later if you want.Pros:15.6-inch full hd screenfull-length keyboarddecent battery life256GB SSD comes on m.2 slot which is great if you want to upgrade your storage as the 2.5inch slot is emptyCons:the camera is 0.3mp, poor qualityno backlit keyboard"
4,"Best laptop in this price range, good and premium look, enough RAMof 8GB. Little short with storage. Battery backup is average.1. Premium look2. 8GB ram3. 256 SSD4. MS officeCons1. Average battery backup- 4 hours2. No USB 3.03. No ethernet port4. Camera quality - not that good.5. Display view angle is less."

Good enough¬∞> I will suggest u if it seem ms office is not Preinstall no worry... Directly contact lenovo customer care they will help u and amazon will just say toh refund on replace..
5,*Best Laptop under this Budget .*It is for  daily use laptops  .*But fast accessing*Battery level only three to four hours*But if u want to buy laptop under 30000Choose this laptop
3,"Reviewing after a month of useValue for money, good performance as expected from ryzen 3 , boots up in 15 sec ,Gaming - GTA V 30fps @ 720p enjoyable , 20fps @ 1080p beautiful but not playable.Valorant - 55-65 fps (max 76fps)Photoshop working good , blender lags & isn't good for extended work session , android studio running good , build quality is not good , camera is bad"
4,"Got the laptop yesterday for around 31k, Overall good laptop look wise good it boots really fast for me it take 5-6 seconds .But the camera and sound quality is not as good so these two are the cons which can be improved in the actual price of 42k ."
5,This is an awesome product and well packaged.The laptop is working well. There is no sound produced by the fan. The booting speed is quite well. The performance of the laptop is awesome.The quality of the product is good. The battery life is very good and it stands up to four to five hours. The screen is not bad but that doesn't matter. This laptop is good at this price. 30k.
4,"After doing research on internet, I selected this product and it is amazing with high speed of processing and response. Under budget, it is best laptop with 8gb ram and ssd making it a lot fast speed machine. If you are thinking for i3 then you can also consider ryzen 3. I got this laptop at price of 31k."
5,"I have been using this for 3 weeks now for official purpose. And my experience is excellent compared to price of the laptop, it is fast and light weight.If you use web cam a lot then it dosent have a good camera..other things are totally fine."
5,First of All A Good Product From Lenovo with such Amazing Specs !Pros :Performance : 4.5/5Battery :4/5 (4.5 - 5 hours Normal Usage)Display 4.5/5Build Quality : 4/5 ( Plastic Build )Speakers : 4.5/5Keyboard : 4/5*Cons*Trackpad : 3.5/5Camera : No RatingsNo Type C port and RJ45 Port !
5,"Good packing & i got genuine product, Thanks Amazon..."
4,Slightly on the bulky side for those who prefer lightweight laptops. But good value for money as combination of Ryzen processer and SSD disc is value for money for everyday task and normal office work. We use it for mostly editing in Word and it performs effortlessly on that front.
4,"The product is good, light weight having around 4 hrs battery life.speed is also fine but this product has very less sound.The only negative point is its sound.you can not enjoy any moview without head phone or a sound bar."
1,Never buy lenovo laptop. Only in 11 months without much usage laptop not working properly. And lenovo customer service for repair is pathetic. 14 days have been gone since i have made a service request on lenovo customer support website but till date no solution at all. They don't care what you have gone through. Don't buy lenovo laptop otherwise you will surely regret on your decision.
5,"Really amazing product at this price range, I loved the design and it's battery life.its good light multitasking as well! I have been using from 5 days, and I didn't found a single problem with respect to performance!"
3,only 190 GB Usable from 256gb SSDonly 6 GB RAM Usable from 8GB RAMwebcam totally scrapAverage battery.
2,Ms Office was not pre-installed. Although while purchasing the product it was clearly mentioned it would be pre-installed. It was confirmed by Lenovo technical support.
4,The product is very good. I have give 4 stars because the camera quality is not good. If this can be fixed I'll be happy as my job requires a better cam.My organisation's tech personnel had advised me to buy this. It's working well!
5,Best laptop under this budget performance of the laptop is very good suitable for daily usages but  not for heavy gaming  over all it is a good laptop
5,Best for study and online classes üëå.if you are searching a laptop for online  classes this one is best for you .speakers are op
5,So far we are very happy. Using it for Online classes. We ordered one more. The backlit keyboard is the highlight.
5,"Laptop quality, design, screen quality is too good. Battery backup is also good.Backlit keyboard is attractive and the touchpad is just outstanding.Touchpad works so smoothly."
1,I thought it has backlit keyboard by seeing reviews and answers but i have received the laptop without backlit keyboard
5,I wanted 15.6 inch screen with antiglare 256 gb ssd i3 11th gen best build quality with dell branding. ...dell service is also best ......battery backup is not too good ....it  is about 4.5 to 5hr .....it may be because of 15.6 inch display.....overall i am fully satisfied with this product
5,"Laptop quality, design, screen quality is too good. Battery backup is also good.Backlit keyboard is attractive and the touchpad is just outstanding.Touchpad works so smoothly.I am very happy for this.Also Amazon fast delivery within 3 days.I got this 37k in Great Indian sale.I recommend for this really nice laptop.Also built quality good."
5,"I got this on 16th aug and waiting some time for giving review. It is a great experience with Amazon amd dell thanks them for the beautiful product. And also a beautiful delivery. Only problem is battery backup is very less, i am getting 3 to 3.5 hours backup with normal use."
1,The hinge of the laptop gave up within 15 days of use . The return period also has expired . I don't expect such a poor product from Dell or does Amazon stock sub standard product and sell it at discount as a new product. Now I have to take it to the dell after sales service .
5,"This review is for the Inspiron 3511, D560581WIN9BE model:- Comes with Office 2019 lifetime- No backlit keyboard- Performance is good, been using it for school work without any hassle- Upgrade to Windows 11 was smooth- Battery lasts well, 4-5 hours when on zoom calls- Screen is quite ok, the brightness is good for daylight work"
1,"Within 15 days use, while opening the screen frame came out. The plastic quality and body frame is pathetic and third grade. Didn't expect this from Dell as I have used Dell laptops and even using another one at present."
5,"Elegant. Though it's i3 11th gen, it boots up in seconds due to 8 gb ram and ssd in it. Everything is great in it. The best laptop and I have got it in an amazing prime deal in the big sale. Thank you Dell and thanks Amazon as always üòä"
1,Very bad quality
1,Didn‚Äôt receive any mouse which was promised earlier in the partner offers section
1,"Its a very delicate product, cheap plastic body and keypad are worst. The hinges are on the rising side so any or little pressure and they broke within 2 weeks from purchase and cost of replacement is 7k. so not worth it."
4,Laptop is good. Processing is fast due to ssd. Screen brightness could have been more. Battery backup is approx 4 hr tested streaming videos online. No Wifi 6 is a disappointment. Bought at 41990. Over all a good laptop. Very fast for daily use. Games can be played like gta 5 but i will recommend u to play with charger connected as it will boost the performance. There is No backlit keyboard so its difficult to use it in dark. 4 out of 5 star üåü. I think this is one of the best laptop one can buy right now. I recommend it to buy. Built quality is also good. This laptop will last long.
1,"It has been just 25 days since I purchased this product. The seller listed for this product is Appario Retail Private LtdWithin the first couple of days I faced the Blue screen of death errors on this laptop. I ignored those issues as I felt that it might be due to apps i was using.Today when I opened my laptop , the side covering for the screen just tore off like a cardboard paper. I have a feeling that this laptop was a refurbished piece which was put together and just put up for sale on Amazon.I have posted pictures of the current state of this laptop so that others can be saved from such an horrid experience."
4,"I got this product today, i was skeptical about ordering this one because in my mind another product is going on but due the service centers and poor customer service i have chosen DELL of course it's a market leader in laptop segment.Coming to DELL Inspiron 3511Dell should have priced this in more budget friendly because it's have just 256 SSD it's a disappointing other competitors offering much more in this price segment.Positive Sides:1. Laptop display I found very good it automatically adjust brightness and no way it matched amoled displays ( i felt like that )2. Goodwill of the brand, i already own dell laptop i have used it for more than 5 years, no issues at all till todayBattery Test:I have tested this laptop battery and it comes only 3-4 hrs max. DELL should have included fast charger and the battery capacity should have more at least 6hrs would worth the price tag.WIFI:It comes with WIFI5. Common are you joking DELL most of the brand giving WIFI6Build Quality:Good plastic build take care of those hinges (Handle with care)Worth Buying?If you want a trusted brand, good service station then take without having any doubts, Overall nice laptop"
3,Laptop is good but dealer have mentioned ms office license is included.. But when tried to get registered.. Its turned up that no license.. Even i called dell they replied that this laptop is not including ms office license.
1,"This is very unlike Dell , this model has serious design issue , left screen is locked and can't open the screen .Quedtion mark on Dell service,Complaint  reported on 26th Oct till date not resolved as the part is not available?Don't choose blindly Dell"
5,Best laptop in This price..Many people says it is not a good laptop ...But trust me It is amazing Laptop.For Day to Day Use.Cons:-1)No backlight keyboard (but it's not a big issue)............................Seriously it has no more cons .......Laptop is light weight..Build quality is awesome.Keyboard quality awesome.I use this laptop for programming and online classes ....Very smooth performance.

5,"Good laptop for beginners and students. Thin and stylish, Quick Boot and shut down, Good touch pad, Num lock and Caps lock indicators in the keyboard, Average battery life for average use. MS office is an online version you need internet connection to use the office. There is a Bios Update and other driver updates available in the  Lenovo website. Over all Good experience"

5,"I'm a Technology Enthusiast and also a business owner, I'm already using One MacBook Pro but im in need of one more laptop because of increase work load.I Come across RDP brand thru Google, when i searched laptop under 25000, i heard RDP name for the first time, so i did a little research about the company and come across that it is an indian company based out of RDP, who design and manufacture IT Hardware - nice website and nice company profile.I was worried about their post sales service before the purchase being a new brand, so i just did a ghost call to their company number for a service request, then they promptly created support ticket asking for the device serial number that i could not give because i dont have one, so i said ill share later today and ended the call, to my surprise im getting reminder mails from them to share the serial number of the device to take my support request formward, out of my curiosity i called them again and said thanks for reminder mails and asked about their support system, then the person said we have strict SLA to every customer ticket so we do lot of followup with customers and asked me to download their SLA table from their website home page, i downloaded the SLA table and blown my mind that they have such a hard commitment towards post sales support.so with out further ado i just went ahead and purchased, great amazon delivery i got it before the promised time...The device packing is awesome, the device built is excellent, as it came with Windows 10 Pro Original with Windows sticker and Intel sticker on it assured me the quality standard..last 24 hours im using it, i strongly feel it is worth more than what i have paid, it has quad core processor, 4gb ram, i got 7+ hour battery backup, screen is superb, it has 64gb storage but it has microsd slot and HDD slot (so i can fix HDD/SDD any time if i require more space) now a days all my applications are cloud, so immediately i no need to think of additional storage.i give 5-star rating and strongly suggest to buy this product, if your usage applications are Internet Browsing (10-15 browsing tabs simulatenously), online meetings/classes, MS Office, youtube/netflix sound is very good inside the room, but not loud in public places, i started using zoho business applications and tally, it is super smooth because of quad-core processor and 4gb ram - i dont recommed this device if you want to use photoshop/3D studio or video editing or play high end games.it has suffient i/o ports as well (USB3, USB2 and even TypeC also), almost to the thickness of my macbook pro, very less weight too (they mentioned it as around 1.4kg)"
5,"@‚Å®Rajesh Uk‚Å©i have purchased this device for my kids online education, this laptop is perfectly working for online classes, the device is very thin and light weight, 6 hours of battery backup is really superb, original windows 10 pro operating system, very nice packing, i have bought this on my neighbour recommendation, he said after sales support is also very good from RDP, amazon delivery also very good.."

5,"After lot of research to buy a laptop for my daughter for her online class, I narrowed down my search to this RDP Thin Book.  As there were only 39 people reviewed, i was not ok to buy it. After reading all these reviews, it gives me lot of confidence. Because I was concerned about the performance , it is Celeron quadcord and only 4Gb RAM with Windows 10 Professional. But actually it is good, it is booting up in 5  to 10 seconds max and the available memory is 46%(RAM). Only Hard disk is 64 GB and there is a slot internally to use additional SSD card. Its been two days, it is so amazing and fast for the Zoom online class. I am yet to install the MSOffice once I add the SSD disk."
1,"I have purchased RDP thinbook on 22/07/2021..after 2 months, its harddisk gone out of order... The product of RDP are not at all providing valur for money, Not only that, against the 1year onsite warranty, i have been calling them  to get it repaired/replaced.. No reply from the RDP work station... Poor quality products and pathetic consumer services, why amazon is boarding these kind of wreckless and useless companies in their commercial site... Amazon also should take some steps against this kind of anti consumer activities"
4,"Was looking for a light weight and light on purse laptop for home use.Came across RDP ThinBook on Amazon, among various other options.Did some digging on RDP and started to like this Indian brand.Aggressively priced, good quality product to meet everyday need.The provision for storage expansion is a great ""mix-n-match"" kind of thing.Screen quality is good, sound quality could be better though.I found RDP support prompt and responsive. I recommend RDP to anyone looking for light usage."
1,"I would not suggest anyone to buy this product. It is service is hights of waste.Internet disconnects every min while working. Mouse behaves cranky and can't control.There is no use of service for a worst product. If any one wants to waste money of 20K‚Çπ simply, buy this product.Other than light weight which is for kids and fast loading, nothing else is good to work with it."
1,"Most worst product, my being an Amazon customer since 8 years, due to this, fradulence activity of fake product by amazon I will drag them to Consumer forum, remain assured"
5,"after laptop delivery, i had few doubts, i called their customer care, their response is prompt and very professional, my first impression on the laptop is very good, performance is more than what i expected, im planning to buy one more device and i also suggested 2 of my friends to buy because of amazon offer"

1,Keyboard keys not working properly.
5,"Initially was a bit sceptical about the brand name, but other reviews helped me pick it and give a try. Product is value for money. As of now it's being used mostly for online schooling by my son. Could easily fit in hard disk from my older laptop which just gave access to all my older data."
4,"I used this product for 2 hours, i was happy, lightweight, sleek, all setup and all done. but then next time it won't start, so maybe the OS got a problem. so i am returning it, but very hopeful replacement will be good."
5,I am very satisfied with my purchase. The built quality is very good.The typing experience is nice. I have both HP Pavillion as well as this laptop. In terms of performance both are at par. But I would rate this Lenovo laptop ahead of HP pavillion because of the built quality and its premium looks..
4,"It's been a month since I've purchased the Ideapad and I am satisfied with it's performance. While I still haven't tested it to its full potential, it has been good at doing my day to day editing, graphic design work and browsing. It's fast and compact.If you work on it while it charges, it does get a little heated but not bad that it radiates a lot of heat. It has gotten stuck a few times but only momentarily. To sum it up, it's a great buy and good investment."
5,"Best in class screen quality, amazing build quality and fast performance.Perfect for streaming and doing core office work.Haven't tried gaming so can't say but overall great laptop."
3,Amazing performance good GPU and CPU but not a value of money it has good performance but not as good as 74000. Feeling cheated. Price dropped  Rs 4000 within 25 days of purchase.

1,"I purchased the order on Jan 28th and got the delivery of the laptop on Jan 30. I bought an 8 GB RAM version, when I started using the laptop, it was hanging, lagging, and running slowed than my 10-year-old laptop. I spoke with HP and they told me that my laptop was registered for the warranty on Dec 2020. I was shocked. There were multiple files in TEMP folder from May, Sep, Oct and Dec 2020.In the name of BRAND NEW product, the seller is selling OLD/ REFURBISHED product. BEAWARE before you buy it."
1,Pathetic experience... while having 8gb RAM performance is very slow... battery run for 2-3 hours.
1,"Processing is dam slow. My dell laptop which was purchased 10 years back is faster than this.Tough they say i3, 11 Gen and 8 GB Ram, do not fall for this. It's absolutely rubbish.Sincere advise, do not buy this product."
2,"I was delighted to see affordable laptop with Intel i3 11th generation with good specs. From the time I opened the machine I felt let down by HP.1. The build quality is really bad. This is my Third HP Laptop and none of the ones I used before had this poor plastics.2. The camera is another huge letdown.3. The major cause of worry is the performance of the system as whole. Though it had better performing Processor and 8 GB RAM, every app takes time to load, horrible lag right from the first time I started the system. Please refer to the attached Screenshot - with just one broser and explorer open the Disk, Memory are shooting up. Everytime I check two of the 3 parameters (Disk, Memory, CPU) will be hovering around 85-100. Not expected of a new machine.I feel very low to know the investment is bad right from day 1. I think HP wants to milk the rush to buy laptops during Covid lockdown by WFH/Study from School kids. Hope Amazon will pass this feedback to HP as well."
1,"just received  today  22 jan 2021, but model name different its dw3000 , poor performance with hdd  , will try to add SSD and review again. but till now its really really slow"
1,Worst product. Purchsed on Feb 4. Trying to install oracle software to work. Hangs so badly for hours. Booting time is so bad it literally takes 5 to 6 minutes to open up. Worst experience ever. Once I restart the laptop all the data will be erased. I doubt was it really a new lap or refurbished one. Really disappointed.
1,"The much awaited laptop had to be returned as the Silver colour laptop has the key board also silver colour with letters in thin golden colour print. Being a senior citizen with reasonably good vision, I just couldn't use the key boards as the alphabets, numbers & symbols are just not readable in natural light as well as room light. They could be seen with difficulty only when the key board is tilted. But, in the tilted position, the laptop cannot be used. Disappointed. My other laptop, Apple Mac which is also silver colour, has the key board in black with all letters in white and with back light facility to operate even in complete darkness."
2,"My 5 year old laptop is much faster than this laptop, It is having very poor speed, time lags. On 100 mbps Internet  youtube videos get stuck.There is even issue in scrolling on the screen, very slow and it gets stuck in between.Only additional application installed by me on the laptop is the Norton virus scanner. Also tested without Norton application. Same problem.HP  must withdraw this laptop from the market. Bought by the credibility of HP but shocked by the performance.Never buy this model."
3,As per product description the laptop had 3 cell battery but it does not give more than 1 hour backup even when you are not watching videos or listening music. In terms of battery backup it is worst than acer asus performance
1,"First thing is boot time- very slow even with i3 processor.Just in 15 days of usage I got a 3fo error which the customer care has not able to fix since a month.Hp does not have a escalation matrix, no mail support, only what‚Äôs app support.I raised a ticket for on site service which has been more than 10 days now , no sort of contact from any hp employees.I have wasted my time energy and I am frustrated to get help from the customer support."
3,"Not quality, display and sound is good.Apart from that on paper it's configuration is very good 11 th Gen i3 processor 8 GB RAM, but what's inside God knows.My 6 years old Pentium laptop works faster than this. It takes too long time to load chrome.It says M.2 slot is available but it's not nvme, it's PCIe, it means you will get slower speed than nvme.Keyboard letters are visible only if you are watching it from top, if u try to see from sides it's not visible."
1,Several time Hang & battery problemBattery BackupOnly 3 hours
1,"I purchased this laptop believing its new however when I checked for warranty and contacted HP , I came to know that laptop is running under the extended warranty and that too only 9 months are remaining. Original Manufacturer warranty already expired 15 months before. Do not buy it. Also, its my suggestion, pls buy electronic things like laptop, tv etc from offline shops only. Selling old product as new is a fraud."
2,"Serial number of laptop is not written on invoice, and warranty card of that serial number is also not given with item."
3,"I bought this after several research. I am fine with the configuration. Only concern is about the sound and mic quality.. we are using it for my ward's online classes.. due to poor audio and mic, it's not serving its purpose"
3,"Despite its amazing specs this model is extremely slow for some reason. If this is a common defect, HP should offer some sort of a mass fix for this. Very disappointed as my other HP laptops works without a hitch. Will update after I get this inspected by the service team."
1,"This laptop is the tortoise of the i3 11th gen laptops. Maybe i got a faulty product, I don't know. I bought it despite such reviews. there is something wrong with this model. it took ages to just open an app just like in much older devices. beware! avoid this model."
3,"System is nice , booting Speed also good take little more time compare to ssd that's why I feel it's little expensive, build quality , sound, display, etc all are good.alexa is in build but it's not much usefull.Keypad haven't backlight."
5,"You can do all professional work like MS office related or Adobe Reader, Videos, Web even though High Ended Games are playable(E.g. Shadow of Tomb Raider, Arkham Knights) with Low Settings like Resolution around 720p and all advanced settings disbaled(Vsync, TAA etc.)."
4,Firstly I was afraid to buy it online due to negative reviews but I ordered it. I got the original product by appario. I have not any problems till now. Go for it.
4,"Takes time to bootBest for Stay at home moms, writers, online classes, its a school student laptop, good for teachers too"
2,Vry slow
4,Overall performance and silver design(15s-du3038tu) are really good. I buy it for 39k on festival sale.This is not worth for 40k+If you are not concern about color there is a variant 15s-du3040tu(recommending)
1,It's a i3 11 Generation HP Laptop with 8GB RAM. It is a very slow laptop. It takes too much time in booting. I strongly recommend NO for this. I disappointed after expending too much price. Very Bad product. No value for money.
1,"In Amazon they Will tell backup is for 5hours.Butwhile iam using 2min 10%charge discharged. That means 3hrs only and thay didn't partition, only c drive they installed and we need to save file in that .that is worst"
2,"Have not Received the Laptop Bag with the Product, wherein from all Retail atore we get a Bagpack with Laptop. Iam also from IT Industry and know the Norms"
2,"The major problem with this model is, it is very very slow.. Expected a bit faster operations as per laptop specifications..even if you are doing very basic operations even if you are simply browsing few websites..rest things are as expected..battery backup is good"
4,for day to day use it is good one. my use is not so extensive so I m happy with this
3,Laptop is ok but battery life is not more than 3 hours.
3,Processing are very slow
1,I am using almost from months time. For my KG going kid schooling purpose. God knows how HP build and approve the product. Every time getting hang. I have updated all the software from authentic source.
1,Poor quality and refurbished product delivered
1,"At the start of computer purchasing desktop was very fast, but as days go by about 3 or 4 days it is taking more time and also google chrome wasn""t working well and on a short timer intervals it goes black and comes back again, in my view home premium is totally worthless and waste."
1,System works very slow though it claims to be 8GB RAM. It takes minutes to open some apps whereas same apps gets opened in mobile of lesser RAM in few seconds
3,Bought for 43k this month.Now price is around 38k.Not so good..only 2 cores.average performance..quality ok..
4,"I recently made this purchase, which is the first time I made a purchase for such a large amount on Amazon. The laptop was delivered in a good condition. One thing I noticed was that, as some other reviewers mentioned, the warranty was already active about 10 days before I actually received the machine, which I didn't understand. Lenovo and Amazon should clarify this. I had a 15 inch laptop before so this is a little smaller comparatively. It is good for light entertainment, and for office work like preparing documents and presentations. I would not use for it gaming, and in fact I would suggest would be gamers to save their money by assembling a desktop, which is both cheaper and long lasting. For most people working at home, in fact, if you're not going to move around and have no need of travelling for work purposes, a desktop is a far better idea, and most of the time I work on desktop in my office.This laptop is light and fairly fast due to the ssd, although you can swap the drives out for ssds both in the SATA and NVME slots to give you even faster perfomance. There is only one So-DIMM slot, occupied with 8gb gram, with a max of 16gb, so if you want to upgrade to higher and faster RAM modules, you should consider another laptop.The screen is okay and not fabulous like on a macbook or xps, so certainly not recommended for designers and video editors. The keyboard however is quite nice and I love the trackpoint which is fun to use, although I am more accustomed to a trackpad. The trackpad is small and kinda rough, so I don't like it so much, but it gets the job done.In summary, I would recommend this to those who have office or educational work, but are not planning to run heavy gaming or other software like MATLAB, CATIA etc. It is a thinkpad, so definitely long lasting with a great keyboard. I hope this review makes it easier for you to make your decision to buy a new laptop. Finally, Amazon has great support, so I am happy with my decision to buy from them.----‚Äî-‚Äî-------------Update 1Although the hardware is good, Lenovo is terrible at extending warranty or any service related issues. I would say Dell is far better in customer friendliness than Lenovo. I paid for extended warranty but could hardly get any response. Also, there's some backlight bleeding but it's not a major issue until now."
1,Never fall trap of deals. Its amazon new scam that they send you faulty product and after that will not retun your money back
5,"Worth the investment. It's been more than ten months, and the system is working fine.Worth the money. I was in the Apple ecosystem for more than five years. And was using Apple products since 2007. I thought I was competent to use Apple, and it was quite the opposite. Windows and Android shattered my belief about my smartness in regards to choosing tech.I was wondering how people would be so wrong and choose Apple over windows and Android.Yes, Apple looks beautiful but then without brains!It's like your local syllabus pretending to be IB syllabus.It's a welcome change, and this is my 2nd Lenovo in 2 months. And more to come."
1,Received a defective product. Disappointed with shopping for a high prize products in Amazon !! No proper communication for return/refund/replacement of items from either Amazon or Manufacturers
1,"Didn‚Äôt even boot-up.The laptop had some hardware issues, it didn‚Äôt even start. On startup it displayed ‚Äúfan error‚Äù and shut down immediately.Make sure you make a video while unboxing and while starting the laptop for the first time. It will help during interactions with Amazon and Lenovo."
5,"One thing i was really confused about before buying, is there are two models available20RAS0W500 and 20RAS0JW00 , both having exact similar specification.Only difference I found is W500 has NVME SSD whereas JW00 has SATA SSD. NVME is always better to choose. rest all specs are same.Great looks, feels sturdy and very comfortable keyboard. Charge to 100 % in approx. 75-80 mins. and last for 6/7 hrs minimum with average usage. 14 inch is always better than 15 inch option as it is comparatively lighter to carry and more battery backup than 15 inch.Also the backlit works fine but is not as good as compared to ideapad servies."
1,Full payment taken in advance and defective product delivered on November 9th. Wait for Technician to come on November 12th for next steps. Such a waste of time.
1,"Brought E14 on 16 November and delivered a faulty product which will not boot . After multiple followups (10 times in 7 days) one person came and checked to confirm the laptop is indeed not working. He also mentioned this laptop has frequent problems. Based on that, I have asked for Refund of my money.. Alas, there is no refund possible from Amazon !!!!Apparantly only replacement with Same faulty series of laptop. Bottom line.. DO NOT BUY SUCH DEVICE FROM AMAZON. Buy it from traditional brick and motor showrooms where you can see touch and get the product you are looking for !"
1,"Laptop doesn't boot-up at all. It shows Lenovo splash screen and shuts down immediately after showing ""Fan Error"" message. Do record video during unboxing and turning on Laptop, which will be proof of your case and helpful to explain it to Amazon customer service representative.They are replacing the product, hoping that next one will work fine."
5,"I wanted a high performance but budget laptop for my son, who joined B.Tech recently. This purchase was perfect for him. The laptop had very good features and comes are a price at least 30% lesser than normal for such features in other brands! I have been buying laptops for more than 20 years now for my company as an IT Head, so I can recommend this laptop for anybody looking for performance at budget rates."
4,"Its good so far,built quality i love it, best part is keyboard you will love typing on it,i am facing some heating issues on the bottom side on the laptop near air inlet vents, but that maybe be because i use in on my lap or on bed.but is you can elevate the laptop somehow and let the air flow normally, there is no issue then.battery life is 5.5 hrs aprox ( half hr +/-).for now its going really greati havent played games in it yet (not much of a gamer), will update about it, but its i5 so normal gaming should not be a problem.other wise very good productjust that i get only 11 months warranty, i dont know whylets hope i dont face any issue in it within a year or else it will be very disappointing.and yes Display is IPS so no viewing angles issues faces in it, its amazing."
5,"Got this laptop with IPS display, Indeed a great laptop for multitasking for high bandwidth users, I have been using the same in office with TN display which has very narrow viewing angle but this is feast to the eyes with great viewing angle, and excellent contrast.Black is Black not gray."
1,The laptop which i got whose warranty start date already started 6 months which was supposed to show as the day I ordered the item which is very disappointing and please correct this issue in future.
5,Ticks all the boxes1 Good battery life2 Pre installed windows and office3 backlit keyboard with good key travel4 latest generation i5 processor5 light weight and thin metallic  body6 decent anti glare display with IPS panel for better viewing angles
5,Lenovo thinkpad i5 10th generation is truly value for money product . I am using the laptop for last 1  month and till now the experience is very satisfying and up to the mark ...
1,I'm hearing hard-disk click sounds. Really pathetic to see Amazon is delivering faulty pieces.Lenovo Touchpads are not good. I mean it is normal to get fingers sweaty it kind of hang and start moving here and there with sweaty finger. Very poor quality. You need ti have a mouse if you want to work with this laptop.Not worth the price. Keyboard is okay touchpad sucks
4,"It‚Äôs a good laptop. You can certainly gauge the difference in first use w.r.t. speed.One of the misleading feature mentioned is about backlit keyboard, which is completely false. Please rectify this information.Battery backup not as mentioned but lasts longer than average."
4,The ram slot is single so you can‚Äôt upgrade ram further. Reset all is good n nice product.
5,"A fantastic combination of power, beauty, performance and intelligence. I mean this is absolutely magnificent. It's one time investment and this rocks. Battery life, excellent with advanced features like Threshold, camera with ThinkShutter + Camera privacy security, sub mechanical keyboard. I mean what not. The Beauty of ThinkPad cannot be ignored. 8GIGS OF RAM, WITH HDD + SSD, INTEL core  i5 10th Gen . Power  and performance.GO FOR THINKPAD E14 . ITS BEST"
5,"I am reviewing after my 2nd laptop purchase as I replaced my previous laptop due to manufacture defects where every single process of replacement through customer service was just awesome.Got the 2nd laptop in good condition and everything work well.Being student, I love the laptop in aspects of everything.Worth the single penny.So If you are planning to purchase this, then order without having a single thought."
1,Do not order from this seller. You won‚Äôt get full warranty. I had a replacement twice and both the times only 5 months warranty was given. Hence returned the product.
1,"battery life is 3 hours on first charge also. claim is wring by the company. if any problem then have to contact private person, lenovo care is worse ...dont purchase this lenovo laptop. total fraud. laptop is hanging and fan issues always. dont waste money on such  company rather prefer hp or dell. i have wasted 57000 u can save...."
1,"Poor Quality,after the purchase within 15 days in 22 Jan 2021 I have to called replace my motherboard.Later after two day another issue appear black screen os issue,tech. Visited and installed new os.Called many times for Lenovo for replacement but they keep on troubleshooting on this waste laptop."
5,Really this laptop is very good. I hv buy very reasonable price. Key pad was very smooth. But there is no light in keypad. Camera are is very good
1,"No happy with the product , found fadded body ,keypad also founded fadded"
5,"This is a good choice if you are buying it for personal use as well. The system is fast, reliable, and provides the maximum utility that one needs in a Laptop. Loving it!"
1,2102: Detection error on HDD0 (Main HDD)It has not even been a week that I have purchased the laptop and it has started causing trouble while starting the laptop from the 3rd day on daily basis.
3,Laptop is not getting charged after 5 months of usage.Issue with mother board after I consulted service center for battery issue and went for servicing lost all my data and even preloaded softwares.
1,Poor quality of Display...it's not acceptable
1,Laptop did not start. Fan errorSad. We can't use this
5,All time winner!Amazing experience with ThinkPad Laptop.Simply go for it!
3,"So far looking  good, screen is little blurred"
5,Used 8 thinkpads since 2001 and 1st time want to try non thinkpad. This product is light weight and as of now battery life is at par with Thinkpad... overall very happy with this product
1,Worst Acer Laptop
5,"Good Laptop, thin and light with latest intel processor and good battery life. Completely worth buying at this price range."
5,This laptop is very goodGood speedLight weight so easy to carry around5 hours battery back up with normal work
5,one of the best thermals out there intels new Alder Lake CPU with Nvidia RTX 3050 for smooth gamingpersonally using it and liked it so muchJust add another ssd for even better performance
5,"- I am using this laptop for about 15 days and if you need a future-proof laptop then this is the one.- The best part is the thermal system of this laptop, literally, this laptop doesn't heat up which definitely extends the life your laptop.- Almost all software available in the market is optimized to give the best performance with Intel processors and here you got the latest 11 generation intel i5 Hexa core processor.- The build quality is best, the design is awesome and the performance is powerful.- The typing experience you will get on this laptop is simply fabulous, better than Legion and Tuf laptop.- You can easily open the laptop lid with a single hand.- I use MATLAB and some CAD Softwares on this laptop which works very smoothly without any issue.- The battery life is not that good as it is a gaming laptop. It lasts around 3 to 4 hrs for multitasking and heavy work.- Recently, I have upgraded my laptop to windows 11 which is working fine.- The battery life is not that good as it is a gaming laptop."
1,I got a faulty product the charger wasn‚Äôt working and i ordered the 1tb 256ssd variant but i got 512ssd variant delivered which was faulty even thou on my invoice it mentioned the 1tb variant.
5,For gaming and productivity this is hell of a beast in this price range. Aah and yeah battery is not too good but it can easily survive for approx 2:30 hr of normal usage. And at first I got deffective piece but got replaced in 2-3 days which is impressive. Not writting long but at last  wanna say that its value for money. :D
5,Best gaming laptop in this range even after long hours of gaming it does not get much heated like the other laptops.  The display is amazing for gaming. Does not get heated fast can play for 3 to 4 hours without it getting heated.  Comfortable keyboard for gaming. The battery life is excellent for gaming laptop. I thought my charger was not working so I got in touch with the customer care and they were super helpful resolved my issue immediately actually the charger had to be pushed all the way it is a double push when it connects we hear a click sound.
5,"Make sure u insert the charger jack properly, u need to press it hard. Nak pichal pack aipoinai on kakapote."
5,"BATTERY IS A BIT LOW COMPARED TO OTHERS OF SAME PRICE BUT HDD AND SSD COMBO MAKES UP FOR THE LOSS, THERMALS ARE AWESOME.SERIOUSLY GO FOR IT IF YOU WANT BEST RTX 3050 LAPTOP, EVEN THOUGH THE TGP OF THE GPU IS A BIT LOWER THAN THE ROG STRIX G15, THE PERFORMANCE IS TOO BIG. HENCE GO FOR IT."
5,"Worth the money, if anybodys laptop is unable to charge up, remember to push the pin inside the charger port all the way in."
5,Super for gaming and editing
5,Good for gaming and editing.I love it.
5,Been using this for almost 3 months.. performance is great..audio is average but rest all are great.
5,I bought this laptop for multi tasking and this laptop nailed it.! Just ran gta 5 and pubg at a time and it worked without any lag. I had best experience with this.
5,Display quality compromise but company fix that but there is no firmware update through company
4,After replacement I got the Best Product..Worth For The Money..Fast Replacement...1st Photo where keypad lights are not working..2nd one which I got after replacement..
5,Good GamingGood Performance
5,Good laptop
5,Good product
5,Good laptop at this range. Laptop speed is fentastic. And looking good with rgb keyboard and the buttons of keyboard are also good.
5,Love the Laptop. If you're looking for an excellent gaming laptop under 70k this is the best choice.
4,"Go for it, it's a nice pick."
5,Laptop is very slow unable to utilize
5,I received damaged product
5,Very fast booting process good quality but keyboard quality is not very good.
4,"The laptop has good specs. Booting time is very less. I basically use it for office work and general surfing. Overall happy with its performance in one month. Only point of concern is the 512 GB space, which might be less for many."
1,Mcaffe trial license usage had already expired. N it shows warranty period remaining as 11 months and it was already activated almost a month before I purchased laptop. Be careful.
1,Camera quality is soo much poor and built quality is very weak.
2,"I was surprised when I got the product, the laptop is sleek however the build quality is very substandard. The keyboard keys and the plastic used is of very low quality. Not happy after paying 55k for this."
3,"My opinion is Better to buy electronics in stores rather than online.... Iam very dissapointed i bought washing machine, tv and laptop and even mobiles none of them working well....i think some scam is going between amazon and constumer... Easily heated..charging capacity is very less.... Some one is replacing the parts of electronics b/w amazon store to constumer"
1,I would suggest never purchase anything form amazon i have bought this laptop from amazon and it is having 1 year default warranty but when I received the product it is showing only 10 months warranty. I am continually chasing amazon but they are not able to resolve the issue each time i have to explain the issue from start
4,"The laptop is very good but not the best. Just as the rating says, it has four good things and one bad thing out of five features.Pros:1) Outer design is good2) Fast processing. The combination of i5 11th gen, 512GB SSD, 8GB RAM and 32 GB Octane memory is so good that all of the software applications together are working really great without any lag.3) The boot time and shutdown time is so quick. It hardly takes 7 seconds when starting up and similar time for shut down as well.4) The weight of the laptop is too less.5) Awesome Sound Quality. I keep the sound level at 30-40, which is good enough for watching a movie. Just imagine what 100 level volume gives you.6) The features that are already provided like MS Office lifetime and the price that I obtained for are cool.Cons:The battery is not that good. The specifications in the amazon product detail page says 8 hours, but it gives only 4 hours of good working time. And if you are working on multiple applications, it is further less. Also, the keyboard quality is too bad. The letters and numbers are like painted kind just as the marking paint on the roads."
4,The laptop works fast and downloading speed is superb......The problem is just this that the build quality of it is not good......I mean it can be pressed easily.......I recommend you all to buy this product
1,heating problem üòëüòë
5,"It's nice for daily day to day use for light work (as that's what I am using it for). So not faced any problem untill now, I like it's black colour & nice screen."
4,"First of all the box was broken at one side, I thought it might damage laptop but not. The laptop is very light weight but getting heatup very early and it has noisy fan. The exhaust fan facing towards screen looks very bad design it heated screen.Overall ok product and delivery."
4,"Product is light weighted. Big screen, big size keyboard. Keys could have been better."
5,"Fast booting, loud speakers"
1,Good performance but batteries performance is very low while using any photo shop and other applications battery will empty very fast not it will not comes a hour and camera quality is also very low worst camera very disappointed warranty is already started before I buy the laptop
5,"I bought it for 50k during offer,everything is awesome about lappy,value for moneyBattery 5/5Booting 5/5Build quality 4/5"
5,"Very nice looking, rough surface to handle easy, very fast login and shutdown. Fast and smooth performance üëå"
4,I liked this laptop. Only issue I found was hp warranty started two months before my purchaseSo I got less than 10 months warranty on product against ‚Äúits being started from date of purchase.‚Äù
4,The performance & all other things are good but only the keyboard quality is not at all good. If the keyboard is good then the Product would have been very good.
1,This is one of the most wast product from HP. pls dont buy this Product it my experience off this product....
5,Op in the chat Market value 59k but Amazon 54990k only discount on card also thx ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòä you Amazon

5,It‚Äôs a very good laptop for study and daily work. Really loved it. It‚Äôs worth it.
3,Heating issue and build quality not that good. Performance is great.

The trackpad is small and kinda rough, so I don't like it so much, but it gets the job done.In summary, I would recommend this to those who have office or educational work, but are not planning to run heavy gaming or other software like MATLAB, CATIA etc. It is a thinkpad, so definitely long lasting with a great keyboard. I hope this review makes it easier for you to make your decision to buy a new laptop. Finally, Amazon has great support, so I am happy with my decision to buy from them.----‚Äî-‚Äî-------------Update 1Although the hardware is good, Lenovo is terrible at extending warranty or any service related issues. I would say Dell is far better in customer friendliness than Lenovo. I paid for extended warranty but could hardly get any response. Also, there's some backlight bleeding but it's not a major issue until now."
1,Never fall trap of deals. Its amazon new scam that they send you faulty product and after that will not retun your money back
5,"Worth the investment. It's been more than ten months, and the system is working fine.Worth the money. I was in the Apple ecosystem for more than five years. And was using Apple products since 2007. I thought I was competent to use Apple, and it was quite the opposite. Windows and Android shattered my belief about my smartness in regards to choosing tech.I was wondering how people would be so wrong and choose Apple over windows and Android.Yes, Apple looks beautiful but then without brains!It's like your local syllabus pretending to be IB syllabus.It's a welcome change, and this is my 2nd Lenovo in 2 months. And more to come."
1,Received a defective product. Disappointed with shopping for a high prize products in Amazon !! No proper communication for return/refund/replacement of items from either Amazon or Manufacturers
1,"Didn‚Äôt even boot-up.The laptop had some hardware issues, it didn‚Äôt even start. On startup it displayed ‚Äúfan error‚Äù and shut down immediately.Make sure you make a video while unboxing and while starting the laptop for the first time. It will help during interactions with Amazon and Lenovo."
5,"One thing i was really confused about before buying, is there are two models available20RAS0W500 and 20RAS0JW00 , both having exact similar specification.Only difference I found is W500 has NVME SSD whereas JW00 has SATA SSD. NVME is always better to choose. rest all specs are same.Great looks, feels sturdy and very comfortable keyboard. Charge to 100 % in approx. 75-80 mins. and last for 6/7 hrs minimum with average usage. 14 inch is always better than 15 inch option as it is comparatively lighter to carry and more battery backup than 15 inch.Also the backlit works fine but is not as good as compared to ideapad servies."
1,Full payment taken in advance and defective product delivered on November 9th. Wait for Technician to come on November 12th for next steps. Such a waste of time.
1,"Brought E14 on 16 November and delivered a faulty product which will not boot . After multiple followups (10 times in 7 days) one person came and checked to confirm the laptop is indeed not working. He also mentioned this laptop has frequent problems. Based on that, I have asked for Refund of my money.. Alas, there is no refund possible from Amazon !!!!Apparantly only replacement with Same faulty series of laptop. Bottom line.. DO NOT BUY SUCH DEVICE FROM AMAZON. Buy it from traditional brick and motor showrooms where you can see touch and get the product you are looking for !"
1,"Laptop doesn't boot-up at all. It shows Lenovo splash screen and shuts down immediately after showing ""Fan Error"" message. Do record video during unboxing and turning on Laptop, which will be proof of your case and helpful to explain it to Amazon customer service representative.They are replacing the product, hoping that next one will work fine."
5,"I wanted a high performance but budget laptop for my son, who joined B.Tech recently. This purchase was perfect for him. The laptop had very good features and comes are a price at least 30% lesser than normal for such features in other brands! I have been buying laptops for more than 20 years now for my company as an IT Head, so I can recommend this laptop for anybody looking for performance at budget rates."
4,"Its good so far,built quality i love it, best part is keyboard you will love typing on it,i am facing some heating issues on the bottom side on the laptop near air inlet vents, but that maybe be because i use in on my lap or on bed.but is you can elevate the laptop somehow and let the air flow normally, there is no issue then.battery life is 5.5 hrs aprox ( half hr +/-).for now its going really greati havent played games in it yet (not much of a gamer), will update about it, but its i5 so normal gaming should not be a problem.other wise very good productjust that i get only 11 months warranty, i dont know whylets hope i dont face any issue in it within a year or else it will be very disappointing.and yes Display is IPS so no viewing angles issues faces in it, its amazing."
5,"Got this laptop with IPS display, Indeed a great laptop for multitasking for high bandwidth users, I have been using the same in office with TN display which has very narrow viewing angle but this is feast to the eyes with great viewing angle, and excellent contrast.Black is Black not gray."
1,The laptop which i got whose warranty start date already started 6 months which was supposed to show as the day I ordered the item which is very disappointing and please correct this issue in future.
5,Ticks all the boxes1 Good battery life2 Pre installed windows and office3 backlit keyboard with good key travel4 latest generation i5 processor5 light weight and thin metallic  body6 decent anti glare display with IPS panel for better viewing angles
5,Lenovo thinkpad i5 10th generation is truly value for money product . I am using the laptop for last 1  month and till now the experience is very satisfying and up to the mark ...
1,I'm hearing hard-disk click sounds. Really pathetic to see Amazon is delivering faulty pieces.Lenovo Touchpads are not good. I mean it is normal to get fingers sweaty it kind of hang and start moving here and there with sweaty finger. Very poor quality. You need ti have a mouse if you want to work with this laptop.Not worth the price. Keyboard is okay touchpad sucks
4,"It‚Äôs a good laptop. You can certainly gauge the difference in first use w.r.t. speed.One of the misleading feature mentioned is about backlit keyboard, which is completely false. Please rectify this information.Battery backup not as mentioned but lasts longer than average."
4,The ram slot is single so you can‚Äôt upgrade ram further. Reset all is good n nice product.
5,"A fantastic combination of power, beauty, performance and intelligence. I mean this is absolutely magnificent. It's one time investment and this rocks. Battery life, excellent with advanced features like Threshold, camera with ThinkShutter + Camera privacy security, sub mechanical keyboard. I mean what not. The Beauty of ThinkPad cannot be ignored. 8GIGS OF RAM, WITH HDD + SSD, INTEL core  i5 10th Gen . Power  and performance.GO FOR THINKPAD E14 . ITS BEST"
5,"I am reviewing after my 2nd laptop purchase as I replaced my previous laptop due to manufacture defects where every single process of replacement through customer service was just awesome.Got the 2nd laptop in good condition and everything work well.Being student, I love the laptop in aspects of everything.Worth the single penny.So If you are planning to purchase this, then order without having a single thought."
1,Do not order from this seller. You won‚Äôt get full warranty. I had a replacement twice and both the times only 5 months warranty was given. Hence returned the product.
1,"battery life is 3 hours on first charge also. claim is wring by the company. if any problem then have to contact private person, lenovo care is worse ...dont purchase this lenovo laptop. total fraud. laptop is hanging and fan issues always. dont waste money on such  company rather prefer hp or dell. i have wasted 57000 u can save...."
1,"Poor Quality,after the purchase within 15 days in 22 Jan 2021 I have to called replace my motherboard.Later after two day another issue appear black screen os issue,tech.

1,"It heats a lot for basic tasks , i5 i a piece of garbage combined with the non existent fan of LG gram makes it worse (evo certification is just for putting basic things right , it doesn‚Äôt guarantee everythingIf you are a fan of good build please don‚Äôt  go for it , it‚Äôs so flimsy and  the screen wobbles even for a normal speed ceiling fan airLg post sales service i don‚Äôt know please enquire if it‚Äôs  available  near youResale value : don‚Äôt even expect anymorePlease remember this device is not returnable , don‚Äôt have a buyer‚Äôs remorse after buying it1.

Speakers Audio output =  basic phone output.Only ProScreen resolution and Clarity which is not a pro with these many cons"
5,"I have gaming 3 screen setup at home and bought this one to replace my macbook 13"" for travel and work.Pros :-1. Amazing battery life( Above 12 hours everytime I used it and even more).2. Screen size with 16:10 so much extra space.3. Screen quality and color accuracy on this thing is amazing.4. Able to use VScode for frontend with multiple browsers with multiple tabs open without any lag.5. Was able to run linux/Ubuntu WSL2 on windows for running my projects.6. Upgrade to windows 11 and everything feels much better now.7. Keyboard keys are wide which helped in typing accuracy above 96% most of the time.8. Camera for video calls is good enough.9. Speakers on this is good enough please set the music mode to automatic in dts:x settings.10. So light no words.11. Amazing texture and look of the laptop.Cons -1. There was McAfee installed on the system with some cyberlink softwares. (removed them at first sight)2. LG doesn't know how to make good advertisements for their amazing line of products."
5,"I got it at 82990 , mainly for media consumption purpose , for that is perfect.It gets little bit heated at bottom. By default sound is very low but tune dts x app and sound will be perfect fineDisplay is gorgeous with QHD+ and 16:10 display web pages look beautifulConstruction quality is top notch and sturdy will little bit of flex in chassis  which is understandable as it's 17 inch .No laptop bag or pouch is provided .Bezels are narrow .Battery life is fantasticKey caps are largeIt has 2 level of backlitCharging is via type C portTrackpad is large and super smoothOverall enjoyed using laptop"
5,"Single hand open is the best!!Large screen with Quality sound!The best laptop is you are a light user, strongly suggested for Manager or any Business persons who were mostly in between calls.Not for gamersNot for Software engineers."
5,"The laptop is awesomely light in weight and doesn't compromise in performance.I have tested multiple boot on this laptop. Have done software development and ran around 10 BigData JVMs with varying memory capacity, to which the laptop still functioned quite well and supported other multitasks.Have tested this laptop with games such as GTA (till San Andreas), NFS most wanted (max graphics) and Counter strike GO.Battery life on laptop is around 9 hours for casual browsing and non-heavy tasks and around 6 hours for full brightness heavy tasks.All in all, this is a good purchase."
5,"I had an old hp 17"" pavilion laptop and was looking for a replacement. I chose LG gram 17 mainly because of the price and also of very good reviews that I had read about in Forbes and PCmag. And I am not disappointed. At Rs. 82990 it is a real bargain. The specifications and performance are consistent with what is stated in the Amazon website. The only issue that I found was with the display. The various colours appear different from other laptops. For eg red appears as dark shade of orange in LG gram. Also the battery storage capacity is overstated. It lasts only for 6-7 hours.  Another plus point is you get 3 yr warranty unlike other brands which come with only 1 yr."
5,"Purchased just 4 days back. The laptop is very light and well built.After going through multiple Reviews, I opted for 17 Inch model. All the reviews I saw are showing model with Alexa support hence purchased it.But after receiving the unit, found that Alexa support is missing on India variant which is a big let down. LG Look into this and provide support for Alexa.There are several video and questions here in which it is menioned that RAM is expandable but it is not true. RAM is not expandable."
5,Laptop withReasonably good battery lifeClass apart IPS screen. Maybe as good as Retina DisplayFast because of I7 evo processor and latest DDR4 RAM
5,"Very good screen, silent operation, very lightweight, decent battery.Good for light weight workCons-Keyboard is OK, could have been better. RAM is not upgradable."
5,Good Ezperience
5,Excellent performance and light weightWorth buying
5,"I do not think that it is possible to get another laptop at this price. I use it for regular office purpose and it is blazing fast. The batter lasts all day long for 8 hour working day (comes to 55-60% at end of day). Instant wake. Boot time is also extremely low. It is light as a feather. My earlier HP laptop was 14 inches and was much heavier.  The trackpad is centrally placed but because of the numpad (I think) it comes towards the fight of the typing keyboard. Because of this the mouse moves around a lot when typing (maybe there is no palm rejection or it does not work properly). Since I even otherwise use an external mouse, I turn off the trackpad and hence it is not an issue for me. However, for those who use the trackpad normally, it may be an issue. While the screen is high resolution, it is somehow different (unable to explain why). My earlier HP screen was much better.Overall, highly satisfied with the machine."
5,My requirement was a 17 inch with high resolution for spreadsheets and trading. I also needed it to be light weight to carry around. LG nailed it. Screen is superb. CPU Temp is between 43 to 58 (Max). Battery is around 9hrs in mixed usage.My suggestion go with 16GB Ram as Ram is soldered to the board and cannot be upgraded.Overall its a fine product.
5,"UPDATE:So Amazon has updated the invoice with serial number in it and given it to me via email.FULL REVIEW as I promised:1) Build, looks, hardware:Sturdy build, minimal flex, looks great(subjective), hinge goes 180 and feels sturdy.Keyboard is nice to type, has two levels of brightness. Touchpad is good, uses windows precision drivers. No creaky noises from the chassis, 4 cooling vents.Fan noise minimal even at load. Privacy shutter for camera. 4 Usb 3.2 gen 1 ports and has all the ports you need (except sd card slot). Charging brick is of 170watts, charging is super fast(have to turn on rapid charge in lenovo vantage, 80% in one hour). Speakers are decent, can be tuned via dolby software.2) Display:120Hz BOE NV156FHM-NX1.45% NTSC, 63% Srgb, 250 Nits brightness, response rate 14.9ms.Looks just like any other 45% ntsc display out there, brightness more than enough for indoor use, looks fluid due to 120hz, my amateur eyes didn't notice any ghosting. Increase saturation in amd radeon software to make it look better, try calibrating too.I can't lower refresh rate to 60Hz, no such option. Maybe have to use custom software.3) Storage and RAM-SSD: SAMSUNG MZVLB256HBHQ-000L2.Great SSD. Read speeds of 3500MBPS and write speeds of 2500MBPS. Best I've seen so far in a laptop in this range.Has a 2nd SSD slot but have to remove harddrive to access that.HDD: WDC WD10SPZX-08Z10Standard 5400rpm hard drive, speeds upto 120MBPS read/write.RAM: Kingston 3200Mhz LV32D4S2S8HD-8. Can be upgraded upto 64 gigs based on videos online.4) Battery life-60whr battery.Updated Battery Life (70% brightness, startup apps off, better battery + balance mode, hybrid mode on, keyboard lighting level 1)8.5 -9 hours watching offline movies on VLC with airplane mode on.7-8 hours reading PDFs, making notes, little browsing, office apps.5-6 hours light usage like browsing, listening to songs, youtube, background apps open like discord, telegram etc(Do not use chrome, battery and ram eater)5-7 hours YouTube playback4 hours medium usage2-3 hours heavy usage1 hour gaming.Battery life heavily DEPENDS on what you're doing. For most people, it will be 3-5 hours.5) Gaming&Performance-Hardly any difference between 1650 and 1650ti, and this 1650 is as good as a 1650ti on other laptops as you can run your display directly via Nvidia graphics(option in lenovo vantage and BIOS) so you'll get an FPS boost in games.Not much of a gamer myself, bought this mainly for productivity but played hitman 3 at ultra, both cpu and gpu temps were around 66-67 and FPS around 50-80 so good results.  Valorant gave temps around 60 for both CPU and GPU and fps around 150. Check YT videos for gaming reviews.Cinebench R23 gave score of 8600, CPU boosts upto 57 watts(can be more?), slightly more than the competition. Temps stayed below 90 at full load.6) Linux compatibility:Works, I'm running Manjaro but out of the box touchpad isn't working and display brightness can't be lowered(fixes available for both).Great laptop overall, only issue for me is average battery life, I expected more since this has a 60whr battery and a 7nm processor but you can run this for 5+ hours doing light stuff at medium brightness and keyboard lighting off.  Medium usage will give you 3-4 hours(full brightness, keyboard lighting on).Don't expect rtx 3000 series and 1660tis below 70k, we have to settle with 1650s and 1650tis so no point waiting for 2021 laptops if your budget is limited."
5,"The laptop feels premium and the performance is smooth. Have to test some games yet. The only issue is that the brightness is on the lower side. If you're okay with that, look no further, this laptop is for you. The laptop is not the lightest out there like Zephyrus G14, but the weight is manageable considering it's a mid-level gaming laptop.I would go for this one rather than IdeaPad gaming 3 and this laptop is superior in every aspect. For example, this laptop is versatile i.e., can be used at work too as it doesn't have that vulgar gamer look with RGB and shit. Looks stealthy, elegant, and minimalistic.I will be back with a detailed review.Edit 1: Gaming - Played battlefield 1 on this machine. Getting steady 75 fps in performance mode. Surprised by the temperatures which don't go more than 65‚Å∞C even after long gaming sessions. Fan noise is not disturbing too.Edit 2: Played Far Cry 5 on my legion. The game can be run at up to the highest settings, but I opted high and getting 65 fps steadily on average. Again the GPU temperatures don't go above 62‚Å∞C. Some serious cooling!Edit 3: Back with more insight! Valorant runs at an average of 150 fps which is more than anyone can ask for. But it comes at an expense of temperatures which can go to 68 degrees which is not that bad. But still, I used the fps limiter to limit it at 85 fps resulting in cooler 58 degrees. Win-Win for all xD.Also, the speakers on this laptop are great. Great for movie watching andif you really want to, for gaming too. The keyboard is derived from Thinkpad which means it's awesome for any work you throw at it. Keystrokes are clicky and tactile with anti-ghosting enabled.Also a tip, please make a restore point on the external hard drive using macrium reflect immediately after buying. These windows updates can f#*$ up your lovely legion 5. If possible avoid them completely.Will try more recent demanding games and come back. Cheers."
5,I liked everything about this lappy feels great in hands I only faced battery issue which is common in all gaming laptops but makes this different is that super rapid pro charging which charged my lappy from 20 to 80 in 45-50 mins.. that's to kool this is best value for money lappy
5,"This lappy is awesome, at this price point truly a beast. Been using this heavily for 10 days now not cons whatsoever. My purpose is programming plus gaming and my boy this has given me everything ‚ù§ Gaming takes a lot from hardwares, so i am getting good fps an average of 45 to 60 fps on AAA title games like Rdr2, Control so on. FPS games are smooth in Valorant(170 fps) and CSGO(180 fps). 120hz display is quite vivid and speakers are amazing. Lenovo provides a lot of variety to control or tune our device with thier own Vantage software."
5,"Just bought it 3 days ago, my review is based on whatever I have observed in these 3 days. I'll keep editing this review as time passes.Gaming: As of now, I have only installed Forza Horizon 4 and Valorant on the ssd. Forza gave about 70fps on medium settings which i have locked at 60fps. Valorant gives 110-130 fps.Thermals: This laptop is excellent in the thermals department. It barely heats above 80. Even after playing forza for 2 hours cpu was only at 77. The fans are exceptionally quiet. You cant even hear its fans churning in the summer when your ceiling fan makes more noise than your laptop cracking games at performance mode üòùBattery: Reviews here are so negetive about battery but I found it to last around 6-7 hours when doing casual work. (By casual I mean running android studio, chrome and terminal together) Dont expect it to last more than 3 hrs when gaming tho. Well still, Id say battery performance is sufficient. Also it has a rapid charge option, which i havent tried yet. But the battery charges fast enough as it is.Build quality: Legion is legion. Nothing more I can say here.Storage: I wish it had 512 gb ssd. 256 gb fills up way too fast. Only 45 gb free after 3 days. Ps. YOU CAN upgrade storage without removing anything as there is another m.2 slot where you can add a ssd of upto 512 gb. üòÅCoding and video editing: If Multicore performance is what youre after, buy this laptop eyes closed. This is a beast in multicore performance. Leaves i7 11th gen in the dust. Plus 7 nm chip means much less heat. Buy this if you want an entry level workstation at this price. üòçPs: bought at 65k."
4,"Hey,so I've been using this laptop for quite a bit as of now and here are few things that I like and dislike about this laptop in no particular order.Pros:First of all this laptop is blazing fast,like bootup,app loading etc takes minimal time and SSD is amazing.Build- completely made with plastic but it's super sturdy and great quality plastic is used,it will not feel cheap. Material used near keyboard (palmrest) is damn good.ü§§Display- display is decent,I feel somewhat screen could have been a bit more brighter. 120hz is great and I think the difference between it's competitors which offer 144hz screen has no difference overall. It covers 45% NTSC color and almost every laptop(gaming) under this price range has the same so no worries. Unless you're pro photographer and color grading is your go to thing then I don't think you're looking for this laptop or you can get an additional monitor.Speakers- speakers in this laptop is good,you can watch movies without using earphones and worrying about sound quality,audio is by Harman Kardon and it offers great quality while consuming content.Keyboard- there are little things that we don't consider when we're buying a laptop, keyboard is one of them. Keyboard is greaaaaaatttt, I mean greeeaat, although I use an external keyboard but whenever I use the laptop's keyboard it just feels fab and super smooth, also key travel is nice. There's one thing that is subject to personal preference the backlight is basic not RGB, it would have been great if it had the RGB backlight keyboard BUT this normal white backlight also gives this laptop an elegant and bit more professional look.Graphics Card: it's the basic 1650 which is in every laptop coming in this price range and if you're a moderate gamer/casual gamer you should be okay with it. The graphics card is directly connected to the screen of this laptop which is a great as you can visibly get more FPS and better gameplay experience while playing. Use hydbrid mode to enhance battery backup and use the inbuilt GPU and 1650 simultaneously.Battery: Battery is better than I expected when watching movies and screen at 50%-70% it can easily survive for 5-6 hrs or maybe more. Also you should switch into hybrid mode in order to get the most out of the battery. Coming to charging,it has a massive 170W power block,and it can charge using its quick charge 2.0 which is ridiculously fast. You can tweak few settings in Lenovo's Vantage software.Performance: It's a beast,you can throw any apps and games in this can run that smoothly and R5 4600H is an amazing processor and combined with 1650 it delivers a great performance. The thermals in this system is the most amazing part in this laptop, ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§π‡•å‡§≤ ‡§π‡•à. I've been playing Farcry 3 and 4 and it runs like makkhan in high & ultra settings.I bought it for 68k and now it's priced at more than 72k.It's competitors: Asus TUF f15 (Lol it's not a competitor), Acer Nitro 5 (somehow similar), HP victus 16 (do not even consider this).Verdict: Should you buy this? If you get it for 65k go for it, buying this laptop for more than 70k is just waste of money & irrelevant."
5,"Very happy with my purchase (65k!). Been just a couple of days, no problems as of yet. No external defects, no software problems, no missing parts. Everything was perfect, from packaging to performance. Played Far Cry 4 and NFS Payback. Ran buttery smooth, easily giving around 100+ FPS on avg! CPU temp was max around 65¬∞C, and GPU usage was 95-99%.. And the Display is not at all dim, as many have mentioned. It's pretty good indoors. Best part is the built-in Lenovo Vantage app. You can do every necessary thing for your laptop's good performance via that app. And make sure to check your Warranty start date from Lenovo support website. Mine was more than a month before my actual purchase date. Just register a complain and upload your invoice and it will be updated. No issues!"
5,"The laptop performs good, good wifi,good gpu,fast ram but it has a major compromise on display, battery and camera. My 7 years old laptop had a better camera than it. The colours on the display are not that good and the battery is decent. It is a good laptop for gaming. I played valorant 215 fps at highest setting. I upgraded my ram and got a 25fps boost. Gta 5 112max, warzone stable 90 fps. Did see some shutters in the game but after updates it was solved. Overall a good gaming laptop. Must buy if u don't care bout battery üîã.Edit- after updates battery is good and the camera is improved."
5,"It's good laptop, won't say it's best, but yes definitely it's not bad. For gamers it's good to go, one important thing with this machine is like is with it's clean minimal look, doesn't looks like a bulky gaming one, matte plastic finish it's good. No laptop is perfect & no one can claim for such, because every machine will have one or other negative side with the positive, same is with this laptop as well. For professional creator's this is a good laptop to work with 68k budget range. You can upgrade the ssd n ram in future. N people are working on i5 n ryzen 3 to creation purpose so why can't one do it on this good machine.Rest everything is good.I won't b telling about the negative one's, because it's gonna be therein in every machine.Much metta to all ‚ú®"
5,"It have very premium design lookslike very professional not gaminglaptop. But BatteryNot that good getting around 3 hours on normal use(Chrome and classes)thermals are really good of this laptop,but charging speed is good(50% in 25to30 minutes ). Speaker are loud. Overall I'll rate it 4.5/5, as it lacks RGB keyboard and battery and colour accuracy."
5,"Literally, at this price its a supercar. As an IT professional, i use to implement long hours of coding  and yes also gaming.  Its buttery smooth for each and every task you perform.The build quality, it was damn good and also the heat control of this lappy is insane. I worked constantly for 7 to 8 hrs a day but still the laptop is so nuch cooler than expected. If you want a laptop at around 65 to 67k, dont go for anything else just go for it blindly. You will not disappointed."
5,"Battery life is 3.5 hrs on average. Performance wise, this is a beast. (Both processor and graphics card)I play v√†lorant at max settings and parallely I open 10 chrome tabs, 6 PDFs, and more apps running in background. Multitasking at its best.There were reviews saying brightness is not upto the mark, but it works fine for me.Speakers are fine, I'll not say great. They forgot to put some more bass in speakers. I have 2.1 speakers additionally so I prefer to use them.There are lot of ports on this laptop, more than enough.120hz is smooth. I got 160-170 fps average in v√†lorant.Keypad is very good.Thermals are excellent, it doesn't touch high temperatures and you won't feel it.Overall value for money. First I didn't have good opinion on Lenovo laptops before buying. After usage of this laptop, I recommend this to everyone whose needs are gaming, multitasking."
1,"It's not regarding the products quantity, it's about how bad is Amazon's customer service and their return policies. The product I received was defective as it shuts down randomly in middle of nowhere. So I asked for a replacement but since it was out of stock they said they would provide me a return. So I kept the product ready in its original state for return but the delivery guy use to come to the door and says that they can't take this back since it doesn't works. Moreover he added that his Station Manger asked him not to take it back. I called the customer service they assured me that they will contact the station regarding this but they did nothing. Now it's the third time he repeated the same thing. Now I'm stuck with a 68k dead laptop and no one is picking up my call."
1,I bought it on May after 1 month of normal usage.... Laptop video output reduced.... then I called lenovo support....they told to install nvidia driver.... after that display got blurred.... then I raised the complaint in lenovo support ...... Till now no response from lenovo support..... worst service from lenovo......
5,"I am the kinda guy that does not care about the battery life OR the weight of the device, not at least when you know you bought a gaming laptop. Still, it weighs around 2KG and the battery lasts for around 4-5 hrs with normal usage, which, I must say is more than enough.I would say the display could have been better with the color accuracy but this thing with a 120Hz refresh rate does a farely good job averall. You cant change the 120Hz setting to 60Hz though.About the gaming performance: it actually is very scilent and thermally perfected. Stays within 70-75 celcius mark although I havent reached 60 till now but I'm thinking this thing could reach 75-80 if you try to throttle it. Which, I must say, still is very good as compared to the intel varients.Looks wise: AWESOME! I never needed a Gaming Looking kind of a device so this thing does the perfect job in that front.CPU: I havent actually unleashed the beast yet as I am not that hardcore with the use.SSD: This game me about 4bgps of read and 3.5bgps of write speeds. NICEHDD: It has a Toshiba's hdd that does the job down with about 300mbps of read and write speed.The OS is on the 256 M.2 NVMe PCIE (obviously), so, if you want to change the hdd to a SATA SSD, thats without any issue.The device comes with a good amount of packaging support. BUT it does not have a carry bag which could have been an awesome deal if it had one.I got a good deal with 55k only for this."
5,Everything is perfect!Well i was hoping for a good battery backup butit‚Äôs same as other laptops in this price range in terms of battery performanceBut you can get better batter backup using hybrid mode so it‚Äôs fine.One thing i can surely tell you that under 70k budget it‚Äôs the best laptop u can get now.Thermals are awesome and fans are not loud even in performance mode.120hz screen feels really smoothI bet you won‚Äôt switch to 60hz after using it.Overall it‚Äôs a good laptop and if you want to buy it you can go for it without any second thoughts but remember you won‚Äôt get battery backup for 8 hrs while playing games...2hrs-3hrs max u can get if it‚Äôs charged 100 percent but after turning on hybrid mode + lowering your brightness to 50-60 percent you can get battery backup upto 4-5 hrs.
5,"Great product for ~70k price point. Even though there are laptops Lenovo gameing pad 3 for almost the same spec for ~5k less  , I still went with this because of the port configuration and specially the cooling system . Legion  has OP cooling system and tons upgradability . Got the package with in 2 days and was delivered without any hassle . Only issue is the GPU is 1650 varient . Would have been really OP if there was a 1660 varient under 70k."
5,This Laptop is the best buy u can get under 70k if u r looking for a gaming machine.The thermals are amazing... You can play most of the AAA titles without any lag from medium to high settings... And even though the material is plastic it's biuld like a tank doesn't feel cheap in any way...However there is one con with this device and no it's not the screen brightness like it or not this is the best screen resolution and brightness u can get under this budget and a couple more devices use it... The problem lies with the bleeding it's a lot more than you would like to see... But apart from that it's a perfect device and I would suggest to go for it
4,"The screen is more on a warmer side ,Battery is averaged for office usage or entertainment purpose (lasts around 2.5 hours at 3brightnessIt has 0-7 level for brightness and 0-1 is useless with close to 0 visibility due to warm shades produced on screenRGB production is valued at 33.8%For gaming battery lasts around 50 minutesVery good drivers for sound production and can be used for midi controls over productionSound card badLaptop turns into thermal mode often during games setting at ultra or highCS:GO would easily turn the fans on making it cause more power"
5,"I JUST LOVED IT.Don't compare it with any laptop under 75k, it really has destroyed the competition.HERE ARE SOME PROS AND CONS THAT I FOUND AFTER A MONTH OF USAGE ...PROS1. BUILD QUALITY =>  It has one of the finest build  quality around this budget, it goes head on with  the Asus Tuf lineup in terms of build quality.2. DESIGN => Just loved the minimalistic design, I love aggressive gaming look but I loved  this minimal design.3. TEMPERATURES => One of the key selling  features of this laptop is it's cooling system, it  really is the coolest gaming laptop in the market  rn.4.  Keyboard => It doesn't have a customisable RGB  keyboard but it's so damn good that I don't mind  not having RGB.5.  Performance => It really is a beast.-------------------------------------------------‚Äì---------Cons1. SCREEN => It doesn't feel bright enough to me.2. Build üòë => I know I mentioned it in the pros,  although it is a sturdy laptop but the hinges don't  seem to be that promising ‚òπÔ∏è.3. BUGS => The Vantage software is great but it  needs a lot of improvements. Worst bug is that it  resets all the settings after a restart . But this  could be easily fixed with an update.------------------------------------------------------------Every machine has Cons, but I think if this one month usage was a demo, I'd still buy the legion as it has much more positives than one or two negatives.IMPORTANT TIP : If you want to take your legion's perfory to a whole new level then just add an 8gb ram stick.HOPE YOU FIND THIS HELPFUL AND IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A LAPTOP IN THIS BUDGET THE LEGION HAS NO COMPETITION.JUST GO FOR IT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT !üëçüëçüëçSORRY FOR ANY ERRORS..."
5,"Okay so I had to get a replacement done for this laptop once because the left control button was sticky. Amazon replaced it and the laptop is fantastic for the price.Performance is one of the best that you could get out of a 1650 and R5 4600H because of the thermals and ability to disable optimus.Battery is nothing to write a song about. 3 hours max with Hybrid mode off.Display is surprisingly good. Black levels are great, color reproduction is very good. (Not accurate but very good) comparing to my Elitebook 840 with 98%sRGB, this doesn't look bad at all. +120hz refresh is amazing. Lil bit of ghosting. Brightness is quite high over 300nits for me is pretty darn good.Lenovo could work on QC a little bit. Parts not checked properly for all the components.Amazon service was amazing as usual. Replacements on point."
1,Actually this is very worst product if you wanted to purchase it for an editing laptop ... colour are so bad ..... brightness is very low.RGB is very badHeavy weight is not portable.Size is also large for a 15.6inch display.take more space of your bag .
4,"Thermals are overkill for this specs so the only which would kill this laptop would be dust so take care of operating surrounding. Overall a must buy laptop but with few years the GPU won't handle much of stuff., can't complain cuz we are in India where we are buying a 1000 dollar laptop for gtx 1650 where for the same price overseas we would get a 1660ti. Packing was bad with tape worn out so I suspected foul play but it turned out to be packaging issue.On a side note: Kudos to Lenovo sales team for selling a 2020 laptop in '21 with higher prices than that of overseas."
5,overall its amazing at 65kThe ssd speed is almost near to that of samsung 970 evo plusthe thermals are amazing the gpu temp never goes above 57¬∞Cit is a bit heavythe keyboard is a little disappointingthe lenevo vantage app offers many optimization settingsthe touch pad is smooth.i got 200+ fps in valaorant at low settings.all 4 USB Type A ports are 3.1 Gen 1Type c port can't charge the laptop
4,A decent device if your budget is below 70k. Bought this mainly for mid-tier gaming and coding.Listed out Pros & Cons below.Pros: 1) Good laptop for AAA games if you are looking to run them at medium settings and around 60fpsAC Valhalla - 45+ fpsAC Odyssey - 50+ fpsThe Division 2 - 60+ fpsStar Wars: Jedi fallen Order - 60+ fpsGTA V - 80+ fps2) Pretty good sound system and a snappy keyboard.3) Awesome cooling system where temps hardly go above 80.Cons: 1) Screen brightness is too low to my likeness.2) Battery backup is really pathetic even while not gaming. Hardly getting 3hrs on minimal usage.3) Lenovo warranty is kind of dubious as my warranty start date and purchase date does not match. Have reached out to support but ticket is still pending. Will update if any response.4) Camera quality is bad. Suffices for casual meetings and calls.
5,Best laptop in this budget. I bought it in 68k.
5,"The laptop is great. nice keyboard. build quality is top notch. just the brightness is not good. 250 nits is a setback. 300 would have been perfect. Webcam is typical (bad). thermals are amazing.get ur legion too guys, its better than tuf, nitro and pavilion gaming. can't say abt 5600h nitros"
4,"Overall performance is great in this range. However,The battery is the biggest disappointment. It barely runs for 2 hrs on balanced usage.Also the built quality is not great in this range and these are the areas where i think this product lags.My reviews are based on 3 months of usage."
5,"I am writing for 2 days usages .Battery - 85%Standing 4 to 5 hrs without gaming.Speed - 90%Login and logout , page surfing all are goodDisplay - 100%Smooth looking and good to viewCamera - 75%Good in meet callsSound - 85%Slight noise is there but good oneHardware - 100%Matt finish , quality keys , smooth ports and keybord light nice lookingOS - 100%Original OS but MS Office is trail only not original that's disappointed lotOverall - 90%Go for it ."
5,"Writing this review after 10 continuous days of usage.If you can get this laptop below 65k with offers and sale it is still the best option on market if you are a casual gamer or one interested in esports titles rather than AAA games.Processor - Ryzen 4600h is a beast in performance. The laptop boots up in 5 seconds and generally uses around 30 percent of the processor for general gaming. It is future proof easily for next 3 to 4 years so if you want to work on codings, 3d modelling and video editing for 1080p it is a perfect option.Graphics - GTX 1650 is an entry level gpu but still provides great fps for esports titles. I got 90 fps for PES 2021 and around 80 to 90 in COD Warzone. It will be able to play all pre 2020 games for 60 fps at medium to ultra settings. Also since the display is connected to nvidia gpu it provides better fps stability and response.RAM - it has onboard 8GB 3200MHz ram. I suggest you to upgrade it to 16 Gig by adding another 8 Gb stick as it will improve both your gaming and editing performance due to dual channel.DISPLAY - display is 120hz ips fhd panel with 280 nits brightness. It is really bright enough for indoors and has 63 percent srgb. Good for students and general editor but wouldn't recommend for a professional editor.Keyboard and touchpad - lenovo always has the best keyboards and there is no exception here the keyboard is smooth has great key travel and works really well. There is only one backlight of white color no rgb. Touchoad is really good smooth and highly responsive.BATTERY - you cant expect too much battery life from a gaming laptop but if you use this laptop on hybrid mode and at quiet mode i got 5 hours of screen on time with youtube and general works. Rapid charge feature is really great and charges laptop much quicker. When gaming or intensive work you should on conservative mode it will cut the power for laptop battery thus improving the life of battery.OTHERS - speakers aren't generally highlight of gaming laptops but it has still a good pair with nice quality and little bit of bass. Wifi 6 and bt 5.1 are included. Windows 10 home is preinstalled and fully licensed.UPGRADE - it has 256 gb ssd and 1tb hdd which is enough but if you want faster storage you can upgrade hdd to ssd and used the left out hdd as your external storage using an adapter. Has dual channel ram which can be upgraded to 32 gb but 16gb is enough for gaming.Overall a Brilliant laptop in price segment. You can wait for upcoming rtx 3050 entry level laptops but they are definitely gonna be above 75k to 80k so if you are at a hard 65 k budget then go for it."
3,"First of all the initial unboxing was really good. Loved it. But as soon I opened the laptop, I was dumbstruck upon seeing the Legion logo not glowing. Upon inspection it had a layer of laminate.Okay the first impressions were:1) Laptop is blazing fast man (With the pairing of Ryzen 5 and GTX 1650) it's a feast to your eye coming from 60hz.2) Camera was really bad (considering every gaming laptop camera)3) Battery is really bad (You have to limit your usage pretty much to no internet for getting a good percentage of battery left). I used YouTube for like an hour and the battery depleted way soon. Would've been nice if they had included an option to change the hz to 60.4) Installing softwares went really good. But when i installed and opened 'Your phone' app, the laptop went black. I restarted 4 times and it remained black. But upon 5th restart it became normal.5) Okay guys the main disadvantage of this freakin laptop (more like the seller's fault) Instead of the promised 1 year warranty, i was given 9 months. Come on man that's no way fair.6) Thermals are pretty good after a hour of CSGO and there were no framedrops or so.7) Would really recommend this laptop for anybody who can roam around with the adaptor given and are in need of a proper gaming lot with good thermals.(Also instead of the usual selling price of 68k, the seller sold me this for 75k and I being in need of a good laptop bought this with no second thoughts. Pls don't buy this if the price goes more than 72k.)"
5,"According to me it is 100% worth to buy this laptop in the budget of under 70K.Let us now discuss about it's pros&cons:Pros:1.In fps games like VALORANT,CSGO,etc.It has given me 150+fps in Valorant and arnd 80-90 fps sometimes 100+ on Gta5 High and1080P.2.Second,comes it's thermals,which are very very much optimised,you got 4 air vents for cooling.3.Third is it's display which is connected direct to the Nvidia gpu and its Igpu is disabled.4.Minimum fan noise,your cieling fan can make more noise than this Laptop's fan.5.It's sound quality is above average,it comes with 2 speakers of 2-2 Watts each powered by Harman.Con's:There are not very much cons in this laptop but what I found is that:1.There should be a rgb keyboard at this price range in the Laptop but Lenovo doesn't provide us in this.It's battery backup is also not that bad,it's OK 3/5 for the Battery backup."
1,Third class laptop delivered by amazon. Dead laptop delivered by amazon. I placed replacement order then they book technician visit but technician did not visit and marked visit completed in amazon application. When delivery agent came for replacement he refused to replace because laptop was not turning on. After that I called customer care 10 times all executives assured me your return would be picked without any verification but everytime delivery agent refused to pick up the return because of verification. I frustrated with amazon customer service and their way to deal with customers. I suggest everyone  not to buy this laptop. And also suggest not to buy any product from amazon. Their service is wrost.
4,The product is OK but the lenovo gives only one year warranty and the amazon is telling that it will give 1 year additional warranty from amazon end. How they will fulfill this promise i dont know.
4,Camera and speaker would have been better. Rest all meets the standards specified .  Finger print reader and back light option would be excellent today those aspect getting importance.  It is close to master piece. No heating issue.
1,"The major issue is wifi connectivity. It does not work properly. It takes a long time to connect, sometimes ut does not and a lot of it it gets disconnected all of a sudden at times."
2,"Everything other than fingerprint sensor and backlit keyboard is fine. 8 gb RAM and 512 name ssd dies a great job... Although, backlight keyboard has become a compensation... very disappointing that there is no fingerprint sensor or backlit keyboard"
5,Keyboard quality could have been better. Stylish and thin. Fast processing and quick boot up time.
4,Overall laptop is good and has a good performance ratio in its league but camera quality is very poor . Though you get 60fps streaming but quality is only around 1 mp which is heartbreaking
5,Will add more details after using it for a while.
4,This laptop meets my daily requirements surfing and excel sheets and good to have 512 gb ssd at this price range
4,"Nice colour, it is fast ,good battery backup I expected to have more loud speakers in it ,,audio is good quality,,not bad can be used for simple works for call center job etc not effective for software Engineer work"
5,Affordable product with best features in this budget but I think i5 processor is most better than i3 sooo if someone have any extra budget go for i5 processor thanks Amazon
5,"Great design, love the speed, I have 8gb,512GB, it is super amazing"
5,Pls go for this product. Make sure 8Gb ram and SSD drive for best performance.
5,NIce product for the price
1,"Takes a lot of time to fully charge battery. Also battery life very poor, it drains quickly. Screen dull. I recommend dont purxhase this item"
5,It's good
5,Good product
4,Guys this is a very good laptop for office works and student needs. But this isn't  a hardcore gaming laptop. For good gaming laptop go above 55000.
4,"I love this laptop very much vere easy to operate and having fun to operate in 45000 budget it was very well laptopThanku lenevo ,"
5,Nice build and quality. Lightweight. Quick start  and fast response.
5,Nice
4,The overall product is good. Keypad needs more improvements.
4,Overall laptop is good and has a good performance.

5,Very nice laptop. Thank you Amazon.
5,Good laptop working smooth as expected..
4,Multiple tabs stutter at times
5,Very nice laptop
4,Good speed
1,Very disappointed
2,"In description it is written that laptop is full hd ips displayBut it is not, it is tn dislpay"
1,"Worst experience. It started to hang at first. Then after placing for replacement, serial number was wrong. It took a month to return and refund."
1,their warranty is just a fraud .You would not be able to get repairs later as they won't pick calls and their technical support won't come up.
5,"It's good for office work and to run normal softwares without any hiccups .. got it from offline store . Ssd with i3 11th gen is must.. 2yr onsite warranty is real deal.. work execution is really fast. Most imp build is sturdy, not cheap plastic ... Must buy"
5,1. Great performance on heavy audio editing software.2. superb upgrading capability with both SSD & HDD.3. free SATA cable inside the box.4. Battery performance is ok.
4,"I have used this laptop for almost a week now.I found many pro's as well as cons while using this laptop.First the pros..I tested many games like Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Watch Dogs 2,Destiny 2.No problem whatsoever while gaming.Really good fps in older games like Destiny 2 and Watch Dogs 2,and decent fps in newer titles like AC Valhalla.Some setting tweak and it is possible to get almost 60 fps in Valhalla.The 144hz screen is really great,everything feels smooth tho i wont use it cause the screen is too small.I connected the laptop using hdmi to a monitor.The rgb keyboard is a nice touch.Overall it does what it is good at i.e,gaming.Now for the cons..this laptop gets waaay too loud while gaming.I use headphones and i can still listen to the noise if the volume is low.I was using a PC before so i havent experienced this kind of sound.Now comes the battery backup which is absolutely pathetic.U can barely use this laptop for 1 hour 30 mins while doing normal stuff.The backup is very bad.The other problems i faced is that the adapter gets waaay too hot and i mean it,way too hot while gaming.I plugged it in for 3 hours while gaming and it gets so hot that i almost couldn't touch it.I have to stop between my gaming sessions and unplug the charger for it to cool down which is very frustrating since i was using a PC before and never had to face this kind of problem.Now comes the camera.The camera is...bad,just bad.I would never use it for anything,i would rather use my phone camera for meetings and other stuff.So in conclusion this laptop is good for gaming while plugged in,but for watching movies with backup power,its not great and u can watch only a 2hour movie at most.I would give this laptop a 7/10."
5,"Product works fine for casual gaming. Getting close to 50-60 fps on high setting in AAA titles, and some with 30-40 in ultra setting.The laptop is a bit noisy during gameplay but is silent when performance is not need (daily tasks and surfing).Good job to Amazon for delivering me this laptop under 2 working days!!!Will further update this review every 2 quarters."
1,In the technical details it is shown that microsoft 365 included but came without product key.
4,"I was just making a report on word and using google chrome simultaneously. And look at the temperature of laptop. Literally I scared so much. The feeling was like carrying a bomb on my lap. But this was only just once. Overall I loved display, battery life and speaker."
5,Happy with the laptop & delivery
4,"mainly for the office purpose and it works really good everything looks ggod as new,"
5,Like
1,Got this laptop today. There's wrong description that it has SSD and 1TB hard disk space. There's only SSD. Horrible experience.
1,They have given wrong description here...There is no HDD... any of the feature mentiones not thereIts a scam.
4,I like the product. It is a value for money product. It provides great performance. Excellent viewing experience with the FHD display. I am quite happy with the product.
4,Overall no issue
5,"Laptop is slim and lightweight, Screen size is 15.6' which is standard, and quality of screen is great, battery life is too good, Performance is excellent."
1,Keyboard heats up and windows crashed
1,No words.Don't buy this laptop by spending 40k
5,It is really good love  it the speed is fastIt is the best laptop must buy i play minecraft on 120 plus fps and i can give my classes really fast
1,"Didn't liked it because as promised in the advertisement, this product is not at par with other company standard.Very, very very poor product."
1,"Don't waste your money and time in this product ,there is problem in laptop it's hanging to much.I was experience this problem to much,"
4,"I bought this Laptop couple of weeks ago primarily for my kid's online class, general browsing and basic MS office products usage. It is worth buying for these purpose. Audio is good, Camera is OK (could have been better) for online classes/meeting. Booting, Shut down and processing is fast/good.I am not sure on the performance for Gaming. MS Office Home and Student 2019 is pre-installed. Used Excel, Word and PPT for normal usage. It works fine. Battery life is decent. Key pad is OK.Draw back is its storage capacity. It comes with 256 GB, but usable is approx 237 GB out which around 50 GB (approx) is pre-loaded. So, around 180 GB will be available for our use.If there is a requirement for high volume storage, then this model is not recommended. You may have to buy additional 1TB / 2TB external hard disk for files storage."
1,Noisy fan. Requested for a replacement.The item was replaced by Amazon. Thanks to Amazon for the prompt service though the replacement arrived a little late.Unfortunately the replacement has identified as defective (audio doesn't work). No Amazon is processing refund.In my experience this model is troublesome.
4,Purchased for non office work... Serves my purpose... Screen glares when viewed from different angle other than perfect straight... No back light for keypad.. keys are large enough and typing friendly... Super fast laptop...boots faster and loads the applications quicker...
1,"I brought this laptop 3 weeks back, and the laptop is not working. It's just keep blinking, not charging and screen gets locked every few seconds, finally its says admin disabled account message. I raised support tickets, contact amazon and seller, i have not received any response till date. Please think twice before placing an order at Amazon."
3,"Too Down market product quality.. Laptop Body is made of too bad quality... Battery is too poor, Works only max 3 hours post full charging... Never expected this bad quality product from HP... Don't Buy this product, u will not have a feel that u hv purchased a new Laptop..."
4,"For a person who needs ultra thin laptop for frequent travel within Rs.40k, then go for it.Super fast system.Webcam - looks clear, audio is audible for webinar, online class. Alexa is inbuilt you can enjoy.Internet Wifi connectivity is good.No antiglare,No baclitNot touched upon gaming."
1,Poor display damaging eyes.  What's the use of a laptop with worst screen????It's as good as cheating users without highlighting the trouble within this model.They are trying to trick & sell you this very very very poor product.STAY AWAY.
3,"Overall very satisfied with the product which has everything pre-built in it. Keypads are easy to use and bigger in size. Battery back up is okay. All the ports are also working fine. Writing this review after a week of use.Compared to the specification and my earlier HP laptop purchase, I felt, I bought it at a comparatively higher price."
4,"Light weight Laptop, good for regular office work or school but plastic quality is not upto mark."
4,It‚Äôs worth the price. 14 inch screen .. quite small but overall looks great with good graphics and fast processing.
5,"Interestingly I did not buy it for gaming purpose at all. but for purely academic, where extensive drafting work plus online lecture was required.The size of laptop is hardly little more than the std 15.6inches screen laptop so no issue with the bulkiness but better screen area utilisation. Multiple window work is easily doable.Screen is glare free and easy on eyes,Battery life not an issue as you can adjust the refresh rate and brightness etc and enhance.The deal was superb and unmissable on account of exchange offer.Overall good deal and it served well my purpose."
5,I am not a gamer and it's my first time using a gaming laptop. Before I was on to an low performance one with just 4 gb ram and so... Back then i was dreaming of playing GTA 5 and froza horizon and i had fulfilled it through YouTube. But now I can play what ever shit I want and gives me a different feel of gaming. I regret I was too late on to msi gf series and surely will buy one for my best friend.. Thanks msi for providing this budget friendly gaming beast and supporting new gamers like me.. Iam loving it
5,"I got this laptop under 61k and I love this laptop, it's just amazing, solid bulid quality, looks simply sexy, very smooth as well as fast and it's 144hz screen was cherry on cake but it feels quite heavy otherwise it's an amazing laptop. If ur budget is approx 60k then close ur eyes and buy this without any doubt. Now windows 11 Updatedüòâ"

5,The difference between this and my old device  is wild. It's perfect for multi tasking . Games run without a hitch as you would expect from an msi device. The sound lacks base but super loud . Boot speed is amazing and the cooler boost sure does its thing . The amount of heat you can feel is very low. Overall it's an amazing device
4,"MSI Modern 15 is possibly the cheapest Ryzen 7 Octa Core laptop at this moment. We all know the specs, so I won't bore you with that. Rather let me write the Pros and Cons which I found in my first impression.Pros:1. Well built, metallic body, nice greyish blue color (looks great), minimal clean look2. Lid can be opened with one hand (however the hinge is very loose, got a feeling that anytime the lid may start moving freely, meaning it may not hold. but i could be wrong)3. Great first time setup experience, minimal software present, giving you an unbloated experience4. Expandability -- this is probably the USP of this laptop. 1 extra slot for both RAM and SSD (as per the info I got from internet).. made me buy this laptop5. Performance of Ryzen 7 5700 Octa Core processor6. Good display which is anti glare too7. SSD is snappy (it's a Kingston SSD). Windows boots up in less than 10 seconds.Cons:1. Speaker is average. Sound is very feeble. Even with headphone the sound is nominal.2. No finger print scanner (although I knew it. buts till competition does offer this)3. No webcam shutter4. Opening the bottom cover will void your warranty possibly (because there is a sticker on one of the screws)5. The adapter cable is flimsy and feels very cheap. Feels like it will snap at any moment. Why can't a better quality adapter be provided when we are paying such a premium price for this laptop.6. No RJ45 port. That means no way to connect ethernet cable.7. Only a micro SD slot available.Overall the Ryzen 7 version seems unreasonably pricier than its Ryzen 5 sibling which is being offered at ~ 47k INR at one of the other most prominent online ecommerce stores in India (hope you guessed it !). I felt for the price we are paying, the features could have been better."
1,"I hope all you guys knows the pros of MSI laptop and that's why you are here, Please find the major drawbacks below and think twice before you purchase ""anyway I got trapped"".1. As you can see the attached screenshot, To extend the warranty for one year you need to pay 8499 rupees which is more than 13% of laptop price, and if you search the reviews about msi service you will get to know that they are taking this huge amount for the pathetic service. (Crazy thing is you won't pay that much amount even for your two wheeler 1 year insurance) check with your friends who is using other brand laptop you will get to know the difference because they are not even charging half amount of this.2. Microsoft office is not coming with license, and if you want to purchase a licence it will cost around 8k.Conclusion : Get 16k rupees extra before you purchase this laptop :)"
5,"I have searched online , but no other laptop company provides upgrade upto 64GB of RAM(2 Slots) and extra slot for SSD at this price range. This is the USP for this laptop. Apart from this:1. Build Quality is very Good, metallic Military grade finish.2. Keyboard is good , layout of keys are bit different but good.3. Screen looks nice with less bezel , Screen Brightness is not great but its enough for normal usage.4. Processor is Ryzen 7 5700U octa core , No complaint about performance.5. Camera Quality like other laptops is not good.6. Hinge seems to be not that sturdy, strong , But I hope it lasts long.7. Trackpad is small but it works fine.8. Since there are 2 fans in this laptop and enough space given to blow out heat, there is no heating issue till now.9. Charger looks cheap, It should be branded compare to laptop. But it works fine.10. Connectivity is good.11. Plenty of ports are given except RJ 45.12. Sound Quality is average, not that loud. But If you are using Headphones then it does not matter.13. No Finger Print ScannerFor me overall experience is great. System works fast. Look is simple, sweet and premium. At this price range looking at specs, It's the best choice."
4,Sound outcome is very low sound
5,Very good product!battery backup is excellent! Gaming expirience good!must buy it or lose it
4,"If you want best specifications go for it.And do not fall for the claims about Average audio output from the speakers, it is POOR not even AVERAGE.But if you use an earphone or Headphones you are good to go."
5,It is very good laptop in this price range.i was very disappointed by Amazon delivery which took 12 days to deliver
5,Best laptop in this price range
4,My Backlit keyboard light is not working.I ordered first laptop and it had screen bleeding issue. Now I made a replacement and this new laptop has light issue on keyboard (doesn't turn on keyboard light-hardware issue). Really frustrated to have to go through this.Changing my review after taking my msi laptop to their official service center- the laptop was opened and the keyboard backlight wire was loose. They fixed it in 10minutes and my laptop is good with keyboard backlight issue solved. Hope this helps others. I am rating one star less for the problem faced on new laptop for everything else this was a value for money laptop.
3,"Got it delivered today. Here are my first impressions:1. Sound: it is awfully low. You will always have to use headphones or speakers if you want to listen to something.2. Screen seemed bright enough for me so no complains there.3. WiFi: the signal strength seems to be dropping quicker as you move further away from the router as compared to other laptops. On testing internet speed in the same position, my macbook pro tested 140 Mbps whereas modern 15 showed only 95Mbps ( I have a 150 Mbps connection). The results were the same when testing closer to the router.4. Battery and charging speed are better than other laptops in the price range.5. RAM and SSD are upgradable, cpu is great (only reasons why I bought this machine. You don't get these in any laptop in the price range)."
2,"At a price of 60k, you get a 6-bit IPS panel. I trusted MSI on this, but they again went over like other brands giving 6-bit IPS displays instead of 8-bit."
4,"Performance- Ryzen 7 5700U is an Octa-core processor. No doubt It's the top-of-the-line processor in this price segment. A laptop is snappy. It boots around 4-5 secondsDisplay- I didn't expect that much quality display. The display is really good. But it doesn't feel 15'6 display.Storage - 512 GB SSD is not enough for me. So I'm gonna buy an extra SSD. Yes, it has an extra SSD slot and RAM alsoKeyboard/Touchpad- It's not a full-size keyboard even though it's a 15-inch laptop. It has a backlight, we can change the intensity of the backlight. Key travel is really fast. The touchpad is average.Battery - It varies from user to user. If you are using the internet, the battery will last up to 5-6 Hr. Without the internet, it will last up to 7 hr, not more than that. MSI also provides a 65W charger in-box It charges laptop within 2 HrGaming- It's not meant for gaming. But you play casual games like GTA V, Valorant, on low setting 1080p 50-60 FPS (Plug charger while Gaming)Design- It has Aluminium Body, unlike Other brands that give plastic bodies. Design is unique. You can feel the quality of the Laptop after touching it.Final Verdict- Just don't think it is not a mainstream brand. MSI provides top-of-the-notch quality. I was also really worried about the quality of the laptop, and it is really good.The battery impressed me because it stay longer than I expected. Windows 11 is not till now in Update Setting, so I upgraded through the Microsoft official site. TIll now I now haven't faced any bugs.Some Cons- It doesn‚Äôt have RJ45 PortI don't know it is an issue or not. Some people already talked about this. It is a hinge problem. After 150Degree suddenly falls."
4,So far so good. Bought 4 days back. I have been using Asus laptop from 10 yrs. 1st experience was excellant. Hope this laptop will give the same performance.8GB RAM with prosessor's base speed of 3GHz is giving me an experience of  brousing and other functions as smooth as water. Charging is fast.
3,"It is unfortunate that the product delivered to me is found broken seal of the packet from the company but fortunately the product is ok.Question arised why the seal on the company packet is found broken, is this refurbished or returned unit, the supplier of this product is found something unethical practice of business which may lead to disappointing of the customers at large, I have such experience through my orders of other products supplied by Appario Retailing Pvt Ltd."
4,I got the laptop on 40k. Charger quality is too low. Once laptoo restarted automatically.  But working well till now
4,The product is good but the special price tag is fake. you can get it for 39.9K at any time during sale time or non-sale time!!!!
5,I first time bought asus laptop and literally I think it beats hp and dell laptops in many aspects. Specially the display clarity and quality. Also the built quality is super.
4,Like this product... camera quality is good...i purchase this for my office work
1,It has screen bleeding issue....I got it replaced but new one also has same issue.....
4,"Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).Clarifications/issue points:1. It‚Äôs a plastic body and not aluminium.2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.4. There‚Äôs no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it‚Äôs body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.Pros:1. Configuration is best at this price level.2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.4. It‚Äôs light weight as it‚Äôs a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.6. Display is average and gets the job done.7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it‚Äôs expandable upto 1 TB.9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it‚Äôs a really well thought product by HP.I‚Äôll update this review after one month of usage."
1,"Different charger was sent in the box by Amazon and they were not ready to provide a replacement as I had open the laptop box.Later after several calls and struggle I was able to get the replacement and now, camera is not working for the laptop.Laptop's over-all performance is nice. Buy it from a HP showroom directly instead buying it from Amazon."
5,"Amazing laptop.. I ordered this laptop on its released date i.e. 24th feb seeing it's wonderful configuration.. I must say the decision was right..Thank u HP for this superfast laptop. And after so much of research, I think in HP this is the only laptop with high configuration (11th gen, 16gb ram, 512 SSD, 14 inch screen, light weight, finger sensor & Alexa inbuilt) under this budget."
4,"As soon as I found 11gen Gen i5 at ~62K I got stuck at it & after reading some initial reviews placed an order. Got it at promised time. Here's my review after 3 days.Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance. 1.4 Kg is not too light & noticeable. People complaining about placement of Power Key button beside delete button but believe me it'll hardly ever come your way. The plastic feels like metal. The screen doesn't lift keyboard. Typing is a pleasure.Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Finger print unlock is superfast. Apps opens in no time. Gestures works perfectly. All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram & 512 NvMe SSD.Features: Comes with ""Office Home & Student 2019"" (didn't checked is it lifelong). Dropbox 25GB for 1 year also available. Comes with some HP apps & Express VPN as well. HP quick drop helps you transfer files from your phone easily. It has Type C charging point but not sure if it is delivery charging or receiving charging point. Keyboard is backlit with two setting (full & med bright).Display: Didn't checked in daylight but at home it is very bright. Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure.Camera is 720p Camera is OK. Pictures & Videos are grainy. I won't be using it much so I'm fine with that.Speakers is unbelievably very loud & clear. At 67 its was reaching all across my apartment. Speakers are on the two sides below keyboard.Only drawback I noticed was charging pin is too tight to push & pull out.I will be posting more updates on performance, battery etc & also my overall experience as I keep using more & more.Update after 2 weeks:After lot of research & by doing practical I found that this Laptop can be charged by a Type-C charger. Believe me this is an exclusive piece of information, not many people knows this. HP call center didn't knew this, HP Showroom people don't know this, even when I asked question here someone provided wrong answer. This is an important information they should have mentioned in product detail that this Laptop supports Type C charging. I'm using HP original 65 W Type C power adapter to charge it. Attaching a photo. I did some research myself & found its USB Type C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. After reading this I ordered the Type C power adapter & it worked."
2,"If you are a College student or a professional who depends heavily on laptop for pretty much everyday then  this laptop is not for you. It hangs more often than it runs. Cannot install essential computer science software such as Eclipse or android studio because then this laptop just dies.I took this laptop thinking that it will have good performance based on its configuration.But if you are someone who wants to attend online classes or just browse, then you may go for this laptop."
5,"Very Thin, light weight, fast boot, fast shut down. Longer battery life. You will love watching full HD or 4K videos on this display.As I used for 2 days, so yet to validate battery strength on regular basis. I will share battery review after 1 week.16GB Ram, L3 8MB, 6 core Ryzen 5, NVME, good finger print lock.Delivered next day by Amazon.Keyboard gives initial impact that keys letters/numbers could be bolder. But with continued use you may find it comfortable. I think silver background and light black text may gives illusion of thin text on keys. It might be due to my use of complete black body laptop with white text keys earlier. But not big deal.Software is Win Home provided. Anti virus provided is McAfee which is one month free version. It could have been 1 year. Dropbox 12 month provided free, it could have been 1 month instead of McAfee. MS Office provided is desktop version. Office 365 is not included.I will recommend better you order laptop cushion cover and keyboard cover with this. This generation laptops are very delicate not sterdy as like before"
1,"The battery is gone in a month's time it was delivered on 5-Apr-201, hardware diagnosis says battery needs to be replaced. Have already faced issues where the keys just froze and had to contact support team."
5,11 Gen Laptop with 16GB RAM is a dream combination as of now. Good deal
4,HP Pavilion laptop is slim & look premium. It's design as similar to Apple Macbook Air. I had a another HP Pavilion laptop but it had a complaint that if you open the lap the keyboard cover will slightly bend. This HP Pavilion laptop solve it's problem.Advantage1. Light Weight2. Slim Body3. Great Display & Camera4. Enriched Bang & Olufsen sound5. Output heat is place between screenDisadvantage1. To make laptop slim they had to remove Lan/Ethernet2. The Key are white. Some time we have to turn off to see the letter of the key3. Need to buy Adapter for Lan/Ethernet supply4. There are 2 USB  & One Type C USB. If u need to connect more device buy a5. Some time it is hard to physical connect to USB AConclusion: Since it has some drawback. I did buy the product for it's price & it's Brand Also. I loved it
4,"I just see one month trial version of microsoft 365, it doesn't show me option to setup ms office. can some one help me on this?"
5,"Awesome features in this laptopScreen is delight, back lit keyboard is awesome, finger print recognition is really good. I cannot imagine I could get all these features at this price. Super fast drive, free office what else you need.... 16 gb ramBeen using this for more than 2 weeks.. I am really really happy. On top of it awesome customer care service on what's app"
5,"Did a lot of research and landed on this laptop. I am not a gamer and didn't want a gaming laptop or a laptop with a dedicated graphics card. If that's your thing, then probably look elsewhere. Was not able to find this configuration anywhere for this price - 512gb SSD, 16gb RAM with i5 processor. It's an absolute beast. Everything flies and windows is looking so much better now (I was coming from a macbook pro). I was taken a back at how good this thing is. Does all the daily tasks without a sweat. The audio output is also decent (not great). Has a USB C port which can be used for charging (haven't tried this, but someone else had put a detailed review with this feature - check it out).One con: If you close the lid and connect it to an external monitor, the wifi speed drops, if you're a bit far from your router. Let me explain: my office room is a bit far away from the router (don't ask me why I set it up like this). I took the laptop there and connected it to my monitor and closed the lid and kept it on a stand. The wifi became very slow. I disconnected the monitor and opened the lid and checked to see that the wifi speed was triple now. Googled and saw that the wifi antennas are below the trackpad - so someone suggested to keep the trackpad part of the laptop on top while placing it on the stand. This helped a bit; in the end, I kept the lid a wee bit open on the stand, and this solved the issue."

5,"This is an excellent product. Appearance looks great. Start and shutdown in a blink due to NVMe SSD. All the configurations including RAM, processor, ports are well tested and optimized. Very light waight and portable for frequent travellers."
1,"Good laptop with a decent hardware spec, was able try out some heavy graphics games and sever configuration. The disappointment was the promised MS word processing software with life long validity. Where the seller did not share the product key. This is a common scenario as many other buyers are also complaining. License software subscription is around INR 1200 per year, so please factor in that also in ur owner ship cost.Again this kind of behaviour from one of the reputed sellers on the platform is disappointing."
4,"Bought this laptop DV0543TU during GreatIndianSale-2021 at 54k(including bank offers). Apart from bank offer, I also got free PRIME membership for 1 yr and Audible membership for 6 months bundled with this laptopü§©. Used this laptop for 1 week and below is detailed review üë®‚ÄçüíªPROS üëç- Expandable option available for SSD and RAM. 476 GB of available SSD memory.- Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance- Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Applications starts/loads fast- Applications like Python, PyCharm,Photoshop etc loads quickly and runs efficiently without any hiccups- Speakers are also loud, although bottom firing- Microsoft integration is seamless, hence setup is quick.- USB Type-C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. You can also charge from Type-C port.- Battery last average around 5-6 hours (however depends upon usage patterns)CONS üëé- Charging pin, USB slots is too tight to push & pull out- Does not have SD card slot or fingerprint reader, images shown in AMAZON doesn't have correct images.- No camera shutter/privacy button- If HP doesn't bundle bag, they should atleast provide a carry case or sleeveüö© Keeping aside the cons, the HP Pavilion DV0543TU with (8GB/512GB/i5-11) can be ideal machine for buyers looking for a portable yet powerful machine without a hefty price. It's like using a trimmed down version of HP ENVY premium laptop without compromising on processing power üíª !!!"
2,"Update after one month usage - MS Office 2019 preinstalled edition became unlicensed version within 30 days and refused to activate. HP support shared their product sheet that stated that this laptop came only with a trial version of MS Office 2019. Now I am chasing seller Appario Retail to honour the commitment.Bad experience after paying high price (around ‚Çπ67,000) for preinstalled genuine software.Other wise product has sleek looks, superfast fingerprint scanner, very good display, very responsive touchpad, decent (but tinny) speakers, USB C and barrel plug charging options and under 10 second boot up (SSD drive). Preloaded with Win10 Home and MS Office (not sure whether trial or full version). Drawbacks - weighs 1.42 kg, base gets warm rather quickly and so does the power adapter. Decent for a college student."
1,"Worst Amazon experience ever. This laptop arrived with a defective battery and even after 3 hours of charging, the battery level remained at 65% when the power cord was removed from supply. Immediately on removing the power cord the laptop shuts down. There is no matter any charge left on the laptop battery which seems to be defective. Never expected such a faulty product from HP. Very pathetic and really disappointed. Could not return it or replace it without booking an inspection appointment. Waiting for them to arrive and inspect it. Never buy HP products as they dont appear to be QC ed properly. Could not give a negative rating so selecting 1 star.Edited - The inspection happened 2 days after requesting for replacement. The replacement laptop was approved and ordered. It took another 2 days for Amazon to ship and deliver. However, the delivery person refused to hand over the replacement and accept the defective laptop as he could not power it on!!The actual defect was the battery and there was no way he could start it or power on without using the external power cord.The delivery person left without accepting the inspected and marked defective laptop. I‚Äôm still waiting for confirmation that the laptop will be replaced. Pathetic experience from both Amazon and HP. Would have given negative 10 stars for Earth‚Äôs customer centric company if possible."
4,"Cons:This laptop has rectangular display and if you were using MacBook 13, you might get surprised to see this screen feels smaller than that. So I suggest checking this out in physical store before buying.I did not like the mouse trackpad as it‚Äôs not very responsive and sometimes gives wrong feedback.Battery is decent, If not the best.Pros:Thin, sleek, lightweight and handy.Windows package is good with free office.Laptop in general is quite fast"
5,"Writing this review after 15 days of usage. The box contains the laptop and the charging cable. The laptop weighs  exactly 1.4 KG, and it's quite nice. It has all the specifications as advertised, i.e. 16 GB ram, and 500 GB NVME SSD. It does not have IR camera so no face unlocking will support. The finger print sensor is fast. Office 2019 is pre-installed and needs only to be activated, so while booting up for the first time it's best to have a mail id ready. the USB type C port is good and I have tested with data transfer only, not display and power output, although according to blogs and forums it will support both. Battery life is not completely tested but it's fairly ok, as of now I have got backup worth of definitely 6 hrs."
1,"HP would not consider dead pixel in warranty as they need 2 dead pixels. Above that if in case there is a dead pixel, then they will try their best to put up many reasons to not entertain it in warranty, calling it customer induced damage.. LOL..Buy this at your own risk from Amazon. Who knows what i faced was because of Amazon induced damage during delivery...Someone tell HP that most common reason for a dead pixel is a MANUFACTURING DEFECT.."
1,"A bad choice purchase from amazon. After a week of use, the laptop screen display goes off every 5 to 10 minutes. When it goes off, I need to switch the laptop on, the display comes back and after 5 minutes again goes off, again switch it on.  Tired of it. Frustrated. Don't buy electronics from Amazon."
2,It‚Äôs look like renewed laptop because laptop charging jack is loose and left side speaker sounds like it‚Äôs tear. Bad sound quality  and finger sensor quality look like 2011 touch phone of wing and any Chinese phone touch. Waste of money and one more thing day by day Amazon product quality getting poor
4,"Product design looks good, good display, tacky keyboard and good battery.The price could have been better.And missing on finger scanner!! This was missing information from the Q&AAlso office 2019 is just installed, but not activated. Microsoft account is required to activate. And If you are using a license elsewhere against the Microsoft account, then you will have trouble activating.. Factor this please"
5,"Like:Booting time is very less.Light weightSuper fastFinger touch unlock is super fastDislike:180 hinges are missingOpening lid is not designed properly, bit difficult to open the lid"
1,THE PROCESSOR MENTIONED ON WEBSITE IS OF 4.2GHZ BUT WHAT I RECIEVED IS OF 2.4GHZ
1,Had an issue with the product and the HP service support is horrible.I have called their support number about 10 times and written multiple emails. It‚Äôs been more than 10 days and nothing much has happened.Now the laptop is jst a piece of waste affecting my kids online school.
5,"This is a clean and elegant device. The keyboard strokes are so smooth and makes you to type more. Weighing at 1.75KG it handles with ease. The FHD display with thin bezels gives you an immersive viewing experience. 16GB of RAM, SSD and Ryzen 5 gives you instant responses. It also upgraded itself to Windows 11. One issue was with '@' and '#' as they couldn't be typed. HP Support asked to uninstall and reinstall keyboard driver to solve the issue. However the laptop seems to work fine now even without doing it. Fingerprint reader is fast. The aesthetics is great minus the stickers. Overall a worthy purchase. If you are eligible for exchange please use that option and use credit card for getting a better deal."
4,"I got the laptop last night. It is amazing. The display is awesome. The laptop is very light and it is well constructed overall. The keyboard is great with a few quirks e.g. A somewhat strong backlight. The performance is awesome. Kudos to Lenovo for bringing an excellent product at the right price point to market.There is an inbuilt facility LENOVO VANTAGE to check your laptop overall performance.You can do Hardware Scan, System Update, Enable Dolby, Enable Rapid charge, Enable Network Boost.1. CPU-Intel(R) Core(TM)i5-10300H CPU @ 2.50GHz. Very powerful processor.2. RAM-Samsung 8GB. RAM is not enough. For improved performance, more than 8 GB need to be upgraded.3. The design is very cool and the fabrication quality is very good.4. The battery is like most gaming laptops.5. GPU-NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 makes the gameplay flawless.6. SSD-Samsung 250GB. More than enough to boot OS smoothly.7. HDD-WDC 1 TB. Enough to handle the storage.8. 15.6-inch Full HD with 120 Hz IPS screen for better viewing angles, outstanding image quality and color accuracy.9. The sound and bass quality is really good. Must use the headset in a noisy environment otherwise you will not be able to hear the speaker even with full volume.Top of that you get access to over 100 high-quality Xbox game paas. After one month your subscription continues to be charged at the regular price and selected terms unless cancelled in Microsoft account."
1,"Battery life is not good, approximately 2 hr on full charge. Display quality isn‚Äôt up to the mark. Laptop has internet connectivity issues."
5,Considering the prize( i bought it for 64k ) its very good. U get 120hz panel n other hardware is very good also there is fast charger. Camera privacy shutter is very good addition.
4,"This is best laptop in this price everything is great, with advanced features, best for gaming,study, work, because of its high performance capability.The only thing to be improved in this laptop is BATTERY not very great, hardly 2 hours backup, Better to plugged in for most of the time.Except this everything is just wow, keyboard backlight, privacy camera think shutter, great anti glare high resolution screen, great thermal management,great decent look.Simply good laptop."
5,"First of all build quality is very good it's very light for its build and it's also very solid for a plastic build, second Screen Quality is just awesome and with 120hz it gives a very fast fps for gaming and for normal use, Third Thermals in a strong build and great screen the thermals are very good as it doesn't heat up the laptop and because of its lenovo Vantage you can maintain the thermals pretty well, Now for Gaming I'll be honest I am not much of a gamer so I didn't care for fps or benchmarks but this laptop blew me away with its 1650 gtx and its gaming as by its name it is a beast in gaming and finally its battery, for a great gaming and thermal with heavy performance laptop the battery is pretty good, you'll find in many reviews that the battery life is only 1 or 2 hours but that is not true, if you are using it for surfing on internet or watching a movie or Netflix and chill it will give you approx 3-4 hours of run time but if you're just thinking of gaming in this you'll need to keep it charging during gaming as it will give you 1 - 2 hours max but if you ask me I didn't find it much bothering as I used laptop for 30 mins in surfing over net and then I watched a movie for 2 hours and then it was like 27% on battery and then i kept it on charging while playing call of duty it worked smoothely and the battery didn't bother me, so if you're looking for casual gaming with multi tasking this laptop is your soulmate."
5,"Everthing is fine. The builds is best in the market. No other laptop brand giv s rhis level of toughness. Just one con I would like to mention that while I was playing a game in the game the right mouse button was for aiming and simultaneously left is for shooting. But while I preesed right button to aim and at the same time i wanted  to shoot But it didn't took the left input. Basically it only takes one input at a time. Fortunately I also purchased a Dell wireless keyboard and mouse which solved my issue. But once again this is much better than the legion laptop as it gives you a professional look also and also allows to run heavy games like gta 5 , cyberpunk and also can run gta 6 with these specs. So if you are a casual gamer and doesn't want a gaming look just go for it."
1,"Writing this review after a week of usage.Pros:1. Design is very attractive with very good body finish.2. Keyboard is pretty good.Cons:1. NVidia card is useless as no decent graphic demanding games like GTA 5, Euro Truck Simulator 2 are not running on this laptop. Only games that are sufficient to run on regular intel IRIS XE graphics like CS GO, Far Cry: Primal are working fine. Not getting any help from Lenovo or Lenovo community to get these graphic related issues addressed. So if you are planning to buy considering its NVidia card, don't buy.2. Battery backup is hardly 2-3 hours even with low load like documents work and web browsing.3. Charging most of the times do not work, not sure if it is a manufacturing defect or pin problem. Have to keep the laptop plugged in always."
5,"If you want it only for pure gaming then you can look out for better options.If you are looking for a personal laptop, decent gaming, programming then this will a very good laptop.Pros:‚óèNice built quality‚óèExpandable RAM‚óèSsd + hdd drive‚óèBacklit keyboard‚óèHigh performanceCons:‚óèBattery backup (refer note)‚óèDisplay brightness (depends on your eyes üòÇ)‚óèSpeaker Sound is decent. If you are at a noisy place or your fan speed is at max then you will find it difficult to hear the sound. But at normal times it is fine.Note: Battery backup completely depends on personal usage. As i mentioned above if you buying it for personal use like coding, surfing internet then you can switch to battery saver mode. Battery will easily last for 4hrs+ on 100% charge.Brightness is 250nits only. You may feel like it is little dim. Brightness has to be set to more than 85% only then ul feel like the display is bright. But this is also ok. If you are indoors then it doesnot matter.Iam 100% satisfied with the purchase because i took this after a good research according to my requirements. Check if the laptop has all the features and ticks all the checkboxes in your checklist so that you will not be disappointed after your purchase.I brought it for 57k in sale üòçüòçüòçü•≥ü•≥ü•≥Not recommended if the price is above 65/67k. You can get better laptops at that price than this one."
5,"Completely satisfied with this laptop be it booting time, to processing (medium to little heavy) to size or battery backup. Seems to be a perfect configuration. Comes loaded with win10. It has 8GB Ram(which seems to be sufficient) but can be extended to 16GB along with NVIDIA GTX 1650 with 4gb DDR 6 graphic RAM. It has 120Hz IPS display. Totally satisfied. Could be a little cheaper as it a hybrid system with 256 GB SSD drive and 1 TB regular Hard Drive."
5,"I've hadthe laptop for a konth now and I can say with confidence that it is a very decent laptop. I've seen people complain about the battery which I've had no problem with, because I don't game on the laptop on battery, I usually use it on conservative mode while plugged in as it is obvious that the battery would dry out quick while gaming. The display is great, keyboard and mousepad is very response, the speakers are a let down. So far I've not experienced any noticable problems with it, and for the price I bought it in (60k) it is great, and I highly recommend it."
4,"Advantages:Very smooth performance.good refresh rate.Instant turn on without delay.good screen lighting and comfortable keypad.Disadvantages:Not much, need to explore more as my laptop is just <1 month old as of now.I feel its a little heavy to carry. But as the configurations are high for this price range, its ok to compromise on weight.As it is a gaming laptop, battery backup will be less. currently 3 to 4 hours for me. I might have to change the settings."
1,"I bought this laptop because I need to work on a few softwares. After buying this laptop, I found out that my old buisness laptop works as good if nit better. I'm disappointed for the following reasons-1) The processing speed is not as fast as I expected. It's just an average laptop.2) It's same with all other gaming laptops, but I'm just mentioning- the laptop is very bulky and heavy. The adaptor is very heavy and bulky too.3) It does not include MS Office licence. We'll have to buy that seperately. There are laptops in the same range which involve MS Office licence, check them out before buying this. You'll have to spend extra 7.5k for official MS Office home version.4) The battery backup is mentioned to be around 6.5 hours, maybe that's when the laptop is not being used. It came to be around 2.5 hours for continuous moderate-to-heavy usage.5) The maximum volume is a bit low. It works for music, but it's difficult to listen to someone speaking on a call/meeting when there is some noise on my side (when I switch on the fan or some other random noises)Apart from the display, nothing else is great. It works just alright. I didn't buy this laptop for gaming, so I don't know about the gaming experience. Nevertheless, check a lot of other options before buying this laptop."

1,It's display is not working.
4,"I am using this laptop from past 4 days and my true reviews are-First of all display. It's pretty good and the colors are also fine.The battery is the main issue. With normal office work and meetings it can only run upto 3 to 3.5 hours maximum.Other performance is great.The speakers could be better and the microphone can also be better.The cooling system is not upto mark it cant cool down the laptop quickly. In 15 min of 1080p gaming it was heated and wasnt able to cool down.the charger is pretty good. It charges the laptop in 1.5 hours . Overall if you want to do office work,editing and programming it is good in this price but if you want to do only gaming there are many other laptops you can go for in this price range"
4,4star is due to very Poor Battery. 3 hours max with 100% charging which is very bad. I bought it in store not in Amazon. I would suggest to consider this point for battery backup. I upgraded with 8 more GB of RAM. Robust machine with good features. There r other brands in this processor segment which can be considered but the price variation is there. Overall good with disappointing battery backup which is a not good for WFH.
5,All are fine loved the laptop best screen quality and mouse also so good for gaming purpose it is a budget beast
2,Battery life is very poor as it get fully discharge in 1hr- 1.25 hrs.Overall performance is below average .
1,BAD PACKAGING/ SCRATCHES ON THE SCREEN/ LOOKS SLUGGISH/ USED IT FOR 10 HOURS AND THE BATTERY ISNT GOOD AT ALL. DONT BUY THIS LAPTOP GUYS. ITS NOT WORTH A PURCHASE.BAD PRODUCT.
4,I received the package on time and the laptop is absolutely great there is no issue.Clean and clear delivery and guys please for name sake don't comment negative ratings.I have been using it for Official tasks and its performing great.

5,Really good laptop. Flawless. Value for money. Not for gaming. Battery life is ok. Do not go by the negative comments being posted by people.
4,It was worth it at the affordable price brilliant performance but the audio is little low but it's perfect for notebook and office use. I would like to say purchase the laptop.
5,After using more then a week laptop working fine I have face no issue no lag also good for normal gaming and video quality of screen also good. Worth buy for office work.
3,"The charger is not working, and the laptop is good."
4,"on first impressions it is a value for money, work well without any lag, slim and sturdy, does not have MS Office, screen resolution is nice, keyboard typing is easy"
3,It works OK it's a bit slow can be made faster by disabling few unnecessary background process. Good for casual use. HDD laptop so slow in bootup also. Good points - does not heat up a lot for casual use battery is also not bad keyboard and looks are also good.

2,"its just about okay for online classes and basic email and document editing but its slow and sluggish, screen quality is bad, you can see aliasing in the letters."
1,I had bought the laptop for simple purpose like power point presentation & Excel files. But this laptop is so slow that it takes 25 seconds to open anything. It takes 3 minutes to boot. That to when laptop is not even loaded yet. This laptop is not worth buying at all.

2,Display and processor was not good
5,Great product in the long run
5,"Ordered this laptop y'day and got it delivered today (too quick). The initial impression is very good as even with plastic build, the laptop looks slim & feels premium. I would have preferred a darker colour but didn't had a choice so can't complain on it. Now on the product:1. The keyboard is very responsive and easy to use. Sound is good (not much loud though). Backlit option would have been great :-(2. Display is impressive and fulfils my need for a 15.6 inch view.3. Packaging was basic with an adapter (haven't used yet...it came with 70% charge) and a thin paper manual.4. Setting it up was a breeze but took a long time to download and install all updates - usual pain with new laptop/mobile.5. It comes with Windows 10 pre installed and Office (H&S) which needs to be activated.6. Till now response and performance is awesome. Tried opening Youtube videos, website, files and few games (asphalt and sniper).... everything was a breeze. Been using an i7 laptop since last 2 years and found speed /response to be comparable...but too early to give the crown here.7. Now the most IMP part: A newly launched Product from a reputed manufacturer HP having this combo of  Ryzen 5500/ 8GB RAM/ 512 GB SSD/ Win10/ Office/ 15.6 display under 50K is a STEAL. Got this Beauty at 46.5k (including all offers & CB) so very Happy. You won't find any laptop with similar config for less then 52k currently. If you are on the fence then don't wait, blindly get this beast which is capable of most of the task you can imagine (except hardcore gaming)"
5,"One of best available in the 8GB, 512 SSD, 50k price range. Good to go if you like a larger screen than a typically preferred 14"" screen."
5,"I'm using this device for web & mobile app development. Overall great experience, great performance. I installed Manjaro onto it, which took 1.5 minutes to complete, which is amazing. Only thing is, I installed Network Driver (Realtek on Linux) on my own. It worked fantastic. With full charge, I get 15 hours of battery life (keep in mind that I'm using Linux).The keyboard looks like it has backlight, but it doesn't. I researched online, but none of them made the backlight work which is the only problem as of me.Display is good, audio quality is acceptable.You can run Android Studio smoothly, which tells everything ;)To conclude, it gets the work done. You can seamlessly build Web Applications and Flutter Apps(along with Virtual Device).If you are a Developer, Just go for it.If you are a content creator, you edit the videos without any hastle, but don't expect flagship level rendering(but it does it's job well)."

Easily 5 hr backup, charges is 1.5hrPerformance: ryzen 5500 is beast. No lag till date. Good performanceHeat: 4.5/5,no heating issue. After 2 hr of continuous usage, it heats little. But that managable. Every processer have that issue. Quite normal.Storage: no extra slot, but 500gb can be replaced to 2tb.Memory: 8 gb, expandable to 16 gb.Built: 3/5, not a rough and tough laptop.

Not too great, not too bad.Price: 5/5.best vanlue for money.Ovearall: 4.5.good laptop at this price point. Surely recommend. Bought at 49000 on may 2021.thumbs up."
2,You cant see letters... Grey paint on silver background... Worst idea... How can a big company do this stupid thing... And also it don't have backlit keyboard. Its too hard to type .. can't see a key properly... And beware of display.... It doesn't look good.
4,Cons:No Backlit Keyboard. Average build.Pros:Rest all is great.
5,"Perfect for office work. I have no issues with this product. Totally satisfied. Build is premium. Keyboard and trackpad are of great quality. Screen is okay at this price. Sound is crisp, clear n perfectly loud. Webcam is like all other laptop (dont expect crystal clear video from it). Performance is the no. 1 highlight of this laptop. At this price a 5th gen ryzen 5500u (even though built on Zen2 Architecture) is more than any1 can ask for. Extremely snappy and fast program opening speeds. U can bet on it. Go ahead and experience it urself.Ps - I have no use of a backlit keyboard coz i bought this to use in my office with ample lights."
3,"The looks touch nd feel is premium for sure...light weight , but u will find the performance of system and battery life to be pretty average nd somewhat disappointing considering price point of almost 50k.....Not a  gaming laptop by any means.....but can can play some light games ....For students and wfh purpose...on paper specs looks descent....win10 msoft office 512 ssd no hdd 15.6 inch display fhd and antiglare...no backlit keyboard...ryzen 5 5000 series processor.....still feel the value u get ...is around 40 k but we are paying 10k extra for HP brand"
1,All things are good but trust me guys you should not trust the display...I have been facing display flickering issues while I am playing any kind of videos. My desires to watch movies and series just went airways...Also the hp assistant wasted my 3 hours misguiding me downloading unnecessary updated and even after re installing windows I lost all my data..and finally congratulations on the fact that now display flickers even without playing any video
5,"Just got the laptop y'day. Useful tip: wait for Appario retail to stock it because they give a lower price.The product is advertised as 15s-eq2040u but the HP software installed tells it is 15-ef2000! So there is some mis-selling there? See the attached image.Looks sleek - its not light, but its big screen and is built to a price with plastics, so that's expected.The display is very average, but I kind of expected that. Still its FHD, so that's good. Its got a matte look - which might be the anti-glare coating? Not impressed.It boots from sleep by the time you open the lid fully, and from hibernate in 8 seconds - very nice.The RAM can be doubled to 16GB which makes it a bit future proof, especially as the RAM is shared by the built-in graphics processor."
1,"Microsoft Office Home & Student not installed as assured activation key not provided.Cheap, poor build quality used for body doesn't look like 50k system.Battery backup is poor.Heating very quickly, not suitable for gaming.Don't buy if your preference is gaming or editing etc.Can play games on low settings.Screen colour accuracy is not good.Overall not satisfied with the product, performance, build quality, using it since last two months."
2,"The power button was not working properly. When i click on the power button it is not turned on. The. I thought the laptop has no charging and incorrect it to charging cable, then it turned on and battery was 89%. Why did it not turn on ? It happend 2 times in 4 days. i have decided to return it back and i have not got replaced the device isntead they refunded me. Well i have to search again for someother laptops and all my effort to find the hp laptop was useless."
4,"Laptop is good. No lag so far.If you are are spoiled by good amoled or ips screen, you will be disappointed. This is sva panel. 14 inch has ips could have better screen than 15 inch one14 inch also has backlit keyboard and same battery capacity 41WH."
5,"I have ordered this laptop on 18th may, it had some dents even though Amazon package was good. But Hp package had small holes (approximately 0.5 cm2) with these holes laptop body got two small dents of 2mm2 and 1 mm2. For which I have contacted customer service they readily agreed to replace the  laptop and replacement order received today i.e 30/05/2021. Now I have fully configured the laptop and battery is good. Overall good experience at 45k."
2,"Display screen in description is sva butIt was a low quality tn  panel display images got dark and fade and view angles are also bad .If you want a good screen laptop this laptop is not for you .dont buy this laptop it has only a good processor and nothing else no backlit keyboard no finger print sensors ,no graphic,and has a plastic build .also amazon dont return/refund  this product unless you find a major defectI recommend you to enhance your budget upto 60k go for dell or asus and make sure laptop has a ips antiglare display"
1,"While on hibernate laptop still remains warm. So battery will drain overnight. Tried all possible solutions under power settings, nothing helps. Wifi disconnection is frequent, 1-2 daily. Once disconnected, for sometime wifi will not detect any network.Generally laptop build quality is cheep. Made of full plastic and feels fragile. I am scared screen might damage if you close-open lid frequently. Keyboard also feels cheap.Sound quality is good. Ryzon 5 5500 performs well. CPU and GPU speed is good.Really bad experience with this HP laptop."
4,"Amazing laptop with some hidden issues and flaws.Pros.1. The processor is an over kill for being a day to day laptop. It border line works as a productivity and entry level gaming laptop.2. Great battery life considering it is a 6 core 12 thread processor.Cons.1. Cheap low quality nvme from WD without any good controller.2. Ram is also high density nand with quality controller.3. 14inch laptop has backlight but the 15inch does not have.Minor issues.1. Construction of the laptop was not good, I had to open and align the chasse to close all the gaps.2. There is a place to add a 2.5inch SSD but has been blocked by HP. This was available in the 14inch edition which I bought from Malaysia."
5,"I upgraded from an HP probook 440 g4 so this feels like a Macbook in my hands! Totally value for moneyPros:- The screen is awesome especially when I compare it to my previous laptop, 15.6 inch and not reflective at all, very clear. But you have to view it from the correct angles (how you use a laptop normally) which is fine because nobody uses a laptop looking at the screen sideways or from downwards- The battery life is amazing, lasts anywhere between almost 8h to 12h even when watching videos- The CPU is very nice and latest gen, multitasking is a breeze- The ssd makes it boot up in 2 seconds, I used to wait 4 mins for my previous laptop- You can even play some old games, sims 3 works very smoothly on Medium settings but of course as vram is only 512 mb so can't play intensive games- Build quality is goodCons- The storage might seem less and I don't think you can upgrade it or add an hdd, but this is easily solved by getting an external affordable hard drive for storing items- The dual speakers, while pretty loud, aren't the best quality in terms of clarity, but still pretty good for laptop speakers- The keyboard is not backlit, and the grey paint on silver colour makes it hard to see the keys. Solve this by getting a keyboard cover from Amazon for some 400 rupees, they come in very nice colors and protect keyboard from dust- The webcam is average, not full HD clearOverall I would say get this laptop if this is your budget, without a doubt. It's very good for coding, studying, virtual meetings, entertainment and light gaming, and HP service is usually very good."
5,"Boot up in max. 10 seconds, shut down is in 2-3 seconds. The configuration is worth and it does processing very fast. Compared to my earlier Dell PC (4G ram with i3 10th gen processor), it is at-least 4-5 times faster. Superbly better than the dell and I am totally satisfied with this HP laptop. It's worth and I recommend buying it -- though NOT as a gaming PC. It does most of my normal stuff without lagging/slowness in response."
1,Disappointed with this purchase. Within one and a half month laptop's display went dark right in the middle of work. I have reported the issue (Case Number 5069042865). It's a hardware problem and requesting for a new laptop in exchange as it falls well within warranty.
5,"Super impressed with the performance thos laptop delivers,the new ryzen 5 5500U processor delivers that with ease. I ran Valorant on this lap and it delivered constant 60fps without fail.Also got 10 hrs of battery backup with light work.The oly thing that needs improvement is the screen,There is a bit of light bleeding around the edges.Overall an amazing buy under 50k"
4,"The Laptop is worth its money due to the latest AMD 5000 series processor with 6 (2.1Ghz each) core & 12 threads that helps in numbers crunching processing power.You can also run many editing and Programming softwares seamlessly without any Lag or bottleneck.The best part in this laptop is options for upgrading the RAM upto 16Gb and Hard drive upto 2TB! You can also upgrade it to Windows 11You could smoothly play games such as PUBG, Far-Cry, GTA in low settings. Battery life might be affected due to higher consumption.The only Cons on this laptop is it's display and no LAN port."
4,"I've ordered it on last week, sold by appario retail private ltd, everything is fine, but the laptop has issue with keyboard, one key was not working, issue was intermittent, so I contacted Amazon then they arrange for return.  So my advice is please do check the laptop thoroughly, don't blindly believe in QC sticker."
3,Honest review after using 5 months. Battery life is good. But hardware quality is not so good also sometimes it gets hangs and lagging also. As per product description it has Ryzen 5 but it‚Äôs not work as it has to. Slow processing. You should have to take another option.
5,Beautiful display and beautiful design.. Build quality is good... Laptop is fast..... But one con.... Viewing angel which watching video is not good.... You not able to watch video even you silently change your angle
4,ProsVery good performanceUpgradable ramAwesome and loud speakerNormal battery backupConsDisplay lacks viewing angles. Need to look straightNo backlight keyboard
5,"Like:1. Build quality2. Keyboard, Screen3. Light weight4. Fast processingDislike:It's been only 2 days I bought it. But keyboard back lit should have been there."
1,Worst display.. Don't buy it
4,"This laptop is good but not best at the price . U can go for hp14sfq1030au model which has better screen and backlit keyboard too. But if 15.6 inch is imp for u then u can definitely go for it,it will not let u down. U can do occasional gaming editing and every type of coding stuff. Also on battery life which is 6hrs max i got. Wifi connectivity is fast. But tge camera is very poor. Build quality good but what can u expect from plastic build"
4,"That color rendering on the display could have been better, but this is what we can expect in a midrange laptop I guess. Overall performance barring that brillant with and additonal 8 gb added on"
5,No backlit keyboard. No anti-glare display. These are the 2 big negatives. Otherwise everything is superb. Very light weight. 6 core Ryzen 5 5000 series CPU is very fast. Boot time is less than 10 sec. Build quality is good. Look is beautiful. So far so good.
5,Best thin and light laptop you can get in this price range.Pros:5000 series processer...ssd makes Laptop pretty fast..booting in just 5-6 secondsCons:Screen is not good..I'm seeing some yellow tint always..its because this is not a IPS panelAgain processer because 5500U is still zen 2 architecture not the latest zen 3.
4,I like.. everything is good except the keyboard back light.. there is no keyboard backlight. I feel thats the only drawback in this model. Other than that perfoemace and portability is wonderful
4,"This is got to be best ultrabook which is priced less than 60K, I bought this at Rs.58990/-  from Appario Retail Private Ltd. SellerIts model name as per lenovo website is ideapad 5 14ARE05Various features are not mentioned in product description page and I was doubtful when I ordered whether it will have certain features like fingerprint reader, backlit keyboard, etc.Turns out it does have fingerprint reader, backlit keyboard, MS OFFICE(home and student) lifetime validity.Comes with a feature where laptop automatically boots up when the lid is openedBoot up time is less than 13 secondsKeyboard panel area( palm rest area) of laptop has got a matte finish, does not feel slippery, feels good to hold.Getting Battery Backup of more than 6 hours, just doing regular tasks, no gaming. ( it has different modes such as Intelligent cooling, extreme performance, battery saving mode, I have kept it on intelligent cooling mode, you might get more backup if you are using battery saving mode)My device came with Premium Care Warranty Pack (i.e. It has a base warranty as well as accidental damage protection for 1 year)Now there are  some negatives:You cannot completely bend the display to 180 degrees ( like few others Lenovo laptops)Audio Quality is Average(no bass)Camera is below average(its actually worse than you expect it to be)You may feel the base of the laptop warm although CPU temperature didn't cross 50 degrees Celsius mark. But still there is a bit of warmth at the base when you are using on your lap.Overall a very good purchase, you can go for it if you are looking for a 14-inch laptop in the 60000 price bracket.(excuse me for any typos)EDIT : RAM is NOT upgradable (Laptop was listed recently on lenovo india website and RAM is onboard, contacted the support number to confirm and the representative has confirmed that there is NO second slot for RAM)"
4,"Amazing spects under 60k but complete details must be mentioned like ssd type, Mhz of ram, graphics details, keyboard type, power adapter watt."
1,If graphic processor detail mentioned that should be great as international version have  vega 7 and india version detail is not mentioned
1,I don't know...wtts the issue...is...bt within 10 dayz...it's heating like hell...In just 10 dayz...it's Boot time increased...it became slow....it ssd...read spreed...feel likes it's been forever......worst part is...now I cannot even replace it.....I'm stuck with it....
4,"I'm satisfied with the product ,Lenovo has done great job ,the build quality is good ,I have been using it since a month now ,it gives 7-8 hrs of battery life including my online classes and some research and just some YouTube.the speed is good and thats expected with the processor in it ,overall a good buy I would say."
5,"I bought this laptop especially for the Ryzen 4700 processor which is really hard to get at this price point. This is my honest review after using this for about 4 months:Build: Super build quality. Very compact and light in weight. No creaking or bending happens even when you push it. Only one small thing, the laptop lid opening could have been smoother for one handed operationPerformance: This is the USP for this laptop. Ryzen 4700 is superfast and handles almost anything you throw at it with ease. The SSD helps with the speed tremendously. It takes 5 seconds to boot up which is amazing. I didnt game on this but i am guessing the processor can take that up as well. All applications run smoothly and there is no lag even when multiple applications are open simultaneously.Other pluses: lifetime free office 2019 which is a great addition and free upgrade to window 11 will also be available. Stereo speakers with clear distinction and front firing speakers to avoid any muffling.Cons: The camera is simply horrible. it gives grainy images even in best lit conditions. low light performance of the camera is abysmal. Camera is the weakest thing in this laptop. The battery life is also not that great. I was getting about 5-6 hours of uptime without charge. But the charger is fast charger. Also i wish it had USB C type charger instead of the normal one. The speakers are fairly decent. Not very loud and punchy.Overall, for office work (apart from video calls) and normal day to day useage, this is a great buy."
5,"Its a complete package for professionals as its sleek, portable and powerful. It does all your important office work and even lets you enjoy basic gaming on the other hand.Great matt finish on the top with the metallic upper body.Awesome keyboard with suitable backlight.The battery performance is decent!The speakers are on the weaker side, but does the job at times depending on the media.Connectivity options are great! Fingerprint reader is amazingly fast and the touchpad is also smooth.For the people who love good screens, this one delivers the HD content really beautifully and yeah, it has great viewing angles. Go ahead and watch your favourite shows and movies on it. Its not very bright for outdoors, but won't even disappoint you completely.I am a professional technical writer and have to run multiple tools and do a bit of coding as well. It has proven to be a perfect fit for me.You can go for it blindly if you are looking for a portable, sleek and handy laptop."
1,"Misleading images...no usb c charger in the box , barrel pin charger given in the box. No barrel pin dc in port in the images but there's clearly one on the laptop...extremely annoying,  now I have to spend another 3.5k to get a 20v 3.25amp USB c charger."
5,"Except for the fact that 16GB variant was not released in India at the time of purchase, it the greatest in this price range without a doubt.The only cons that come to my mind:1. It's srgb rating is around 54% or something so basically not for you if you are a content creator with a need for colour accuracy.2. 16 GB RAM is not available and 8GB RAM is soldered so, RAM not upgradable.So if you don't fall into the category that has a extreme need for them, then just go for it.Now then lets answer some obvious concerns regarding a laptop:It has a metal outerbody so doesn't flex.It has a empty m.2 NVME SSD slot.Battery is long enough.Keyboard is great and so is the track pad.It is upgradable to Windows 11(for free of course. Just keep the windows updated and it will eventually show the upgrade when released.)It is not noisy.The speaker are good, as for loudness, windows laptops never specialized in this area did they? Lol. But it is loud enough.Webcam...don't expect something magical, its just enough for video call purposes and such things. Because laptops don't specialise in this area due to demand for thinner bezels.Mic is clear.Well, these are the concerns that I remembered on the spot and answered, I will try to update it if I remember something else.And for the ones new to this AMD Ryzen 7 is a processor that is supposed to rival Intel core i7 but ryzen 7 generally is a better choice as it performs better for better price and lesser power consumption. This is because they use 7nm chips while intel still uses older ones, and SSD is always better than HDD. You can always confirm this on internet."
5,"Excellent product, light weight, very fast, doesn't heat up, and long lasting battery. No problem is using it continuously for 6-7 hours to attend online classes."
1,Guys please do a full testing on the new laptop for defects and issues pls dont blindly trust these people as I had worst experience with 2 laptops buying from Amazon.Pls pls dont assume things and keep the laptop do a test and then come to conclusion.
4,"1. DesignI consider Lenovo‚Äôs ThinkPad series to be the absolute benchmark when it comes to productivity-oriented laptops. For the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15, Lenovo has tried to bring some of that robust and practical design to this meant-for-the-masses laptop. And safe to say, Lenovo makes this rather uninspiring laptop appeal in flesh. This has got a full metal body but with a luxurious ‚ÄúThinkPad-esque‚Äù matte coat of paint for the deck.2.DisplayThe IdeaPad Slim 5i 15, as the name suggests, comes with a 15.6-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. There‚Äôs support for a 45 percent NTSC color gamut and it can go up to peak brightness levels of 300 nits. The refresh rate stays standard at 60Hz, which seems alright given that this isn‚Äôt a gaming PC.3.BatteryWith its 3-cell 57Wh battery, the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15 is rated to last up to 11 hours at a stretch. In the real world though, I found the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15 lasting on an average of 7-8 hours on a regular working day with my kinds of abovementioned workloads, i.e. 9-10 tabs on Chrome with a constant connection to Wi-Fi networks. The 65W adapter tops up the battery from 30 percent in under an hour. Additionally, I was also able to charge the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15 using a 65W OnePlus USB-C power adapter.4. PerformanceHappy to report that the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14-inch feels snappy and handles multitasking very well. Working with 10-15 tabs open in Chrome at the same times proves to be no issue, even when editing spreadsheets at the same time.The Ryzen 4000-series chip is behind this impressive performance, and in Cinebench the 4700U competes with the Intel Core i7-7700K. Even more impressive, GeekBench 5 gives us a single-core score of 1,092 which is on par with the Intel Core i5-9400F, and the multi-core score of 4,800 even beats the same chip with a noticeable margin."
5,The laptop is gives me good experience. nice keypad. track pad gestures are giving fast work experience. IPS Display giving crisp and clear screen. Colors are great. Speakers giving good sound quality.  Wifi 6 connectivity great connectivity. never feels like working in Wifi.Cons.Laptop comes with only two USB ports. that also in right side only.  No USB in left side.  No option to choose OS type while purchase. It comes with Windows 10 Home edition only.
5,"Superior product by Lenovo. excellent build quality considering its price point. NV Me SSD and AMD Ryzen 4700u processor is a deadly combination . Its lightning fast. It powers on so fast that it felt like unlocking a phone. Very lightweight and ultra portable, excellent backlit keyboard also. The key travel and clicking is satisfactory. Color accuracy is not good but you cant expect anything better at this price range . Overall go for it blindly."
4,"overall nice spec in this budget. Thanks amazon for delivering this product in same day that is just in 9 hrs.Prons: 1. Good processor 2. weight is ok in this price range which helps easy handling 3. display quality, keyboard, finger sensor, touchpad , speaker quality is good, all connectivity features/ ports are good.Cons: 1. non upgradable 8 gb ram, camera quality is below than average, UP-DOWN arrow keys are two small for operation"
2,The processor can hardly support games that was launched in 2014 at medium settings. The games start to lag after sometime. HP 5500u  handled the Game much better.
5,The processor is quite powerful since it's an Ryzen 7 but the igpu with 8 GB ram is not ideal I would be better if we had atleast 12 GB and at max 16 GB ram but it's has not updragability option I love the IPS display and lights in the keyboards the only drawback is the ram which affects the igpu's potential
1,"Awesome Processor, Good battery, Decent Screen, decent Build qualitySpeaker good for meetings bad for music okay for movie because it's a front facingWorst keyboard and worst trackpad, no RAM extension, not so good camera, Get current/vibration on metal top while charging"
1,Warranty was only for  9 month instead of 12 month as claimed. Very poor support from Amazon even after raising complaint against seller.
5,Brightness is good enough matt finish works great.Camera is ok but it can be better.Processor is great.GPU is great but u may consider its really less storage if u go for high-end gaming or video editing.Battery life is good enough.NOTE:- Ram isn't upgradable.
5,Very lightweight. Monster battery back up. Faster response for multitasking. Pls read product specs for more details abt component or reach out to me for usage related queries
5,The battery life is too good approx 6-7 hrs .on full charge.Camera is Ok for your regular vedio calls.Brightness is good.Over all a good laptop for business and daily use.A higher end laptop at cheap price.
4,Product got delivered in just one day. Got updated to windows 11 without any trouble and all software licenses are working fine including office. Superb startup time and figure print works very fast. Still haven‚Äôt figured out the power button. Product warranty registration is very easy. Kudos to amazon and the staff for getting in delivered on time as per the commitment .
4,"I hope this issue is with only my device. Top corners of the display panel is not fitted correctly, it is moving and not strong. I have raised a return request. I hope Amazon will respond quickly and help to solve this issue."
5,"Speed Performance is awesome.. sound average. Looks is good .. camera is bad, bad means bad. Plustic build..."
5,"Good Laptop, Fast finger print sensor boots fast thanks to SSD, at this price range Good for basic day to day work.Mine, Sliver coloured is a finger print magnet, it should have been a Matt finish.MSOffice365 is a trial version- 5days free usage, after that it requires purchase."
5,Installation was worst..he just switched on and  logged in..i wanted to know about laptop storage etc...he dont know anything about also internal hdd apparatus was given i asked him he told go to service center and i asked about antivirus installation he told 1 month is free after that u can get..so do i have to pay for installation again..why did he come than
5,good one.. booting time also fast.. inbuild ms office
5,I like this product so much The keyboard is very smoot and it's processor is very good. I am using it last 1 month and every time my family member used. It will shut only at night. And we will start working on it from 9 am in the morning
5,Just go for this laptop.....as it is solid slim and thin laptop in this price range....just ignore everything nd go for it .....totally satisfied
2,"no ethernet, no backlit keyboard, flickering screen, waste of money...."
5,This is a wonder piece and perfect quality product. I recommend it fully.
1,We can't share the screen on monitor.
5,Good item ....
5,Hiii its such really goob laptop pls chose this laptop for codingLet youBuyKkByyy...
1,Product descriptions shows MS office is free but I cannot get key details though I had tried n no of times via customer care.I need key details on priority so help me how to get it.
5,"This is a decent machine with all the features required for an working professional just the sound is average...It's light weight , small and compact which makes it best in its range ...Just go for it...Best machine by asus"
1,Is there anything to like? Defective and refurbished items are sold on amazon. It is useless product. Never buy anything from this site
1,"Edit: reducing my rating from 4 star to 1 star. customer support is not good. Problem with software and they are unable to resolve. Don't buy this...this laptop is garbageProbably I am the first person to buy it. It costed me around 75k and it completely worth it.Pros:Display (it's not 4k, but its almost close)Design (it looks no less to spectre)Light weightImproved StylusGood battery lifeFingerprint sensorDecent processorCons:Only 256GB storage (we get exactly 200GB in it to use, which is terrible)Not for heavy games or heavy video editingThe charger is not type C, so it's a headache.Heating issue at recommended setting - (good thing is we can change the settings to cool)Verdict: best 2 in 1 convertible laptop in market. If u r a gamer or a programmer then stay away, this is not for u. But if some one want laptop which also work as a tablet and easy to take notes, play music/videos, study books.. this is the one.Giving 4 stars ( -1 for poor storage, it should have been 512GB atleast)"
2,"Don't buy this version. It's a 300 nits display as claimed, but hovers around 270 nits. This model number ends with ay0044au.200 gigs of available storage is a bummer. I got this in a rush. Should have waited. The storage doesn't bother me but the brightness does. It doesn't feel adequate sometimes.Get the one on HP website it ends with ay0045au. Better storage and better screen. That one has a 400nits claimed brightness and an actual brightness of 430nits. Overall a better screen and storage for just about 5k extra."
4,"I love the premium feel of this laptop. Its casing is aluminum and is so portable - weighs around 1.3KG. Ryzen 4500 is amazing in comparison to Intel 10th gen. The display is stunning and really good. There is a dedicated button to close the webcam, also one for muting.Things to note: -1)Not for gaming (Can do some light gaming but it does heat up).2)HP provides the HP Pen3)It is a touchscreen laptop4)RAM is not upgradable5)Battery Life - Around 10 hours6)256 GB HDD - If you need more space do reconsider, HDD can be upgraded by the user later on.7)One of the best keyboards I have used in laptops, really good feedback and spacing; especially considering its size.An alternative laptop which is slightly heavier is Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5 (has a better processor 4700 and 512 GB HDD); I am happy with my purchase though"
1,"I was looking forward to buy this, but the Indian pricing is stupid to say the least. After adding import duty, it should be 59k, but you're selling it for 75k?Wouldn't buy or recommend buying this if pricing isn't fixed to at least 60-62k. The specs and build aren't worth more than that."
4,"This was a very satisfying purchase. The price seemed a bit much to be honest but hey, its India the import tax is well you know. This a real premium built with all metal design. Feels good to use, is good to use and plus the pen. Yes you get a type c chargeable pen. Maybe this justifies the price. The only downer is the screen it looks phenomenal but sometimes feels less resolution. Over all Great purchase!"
1,"I bought this laptop a week ago. For a couple of days, it worked really well without any problems. However, recently I've noticed heating issues. Specifically, the touchpad heats up way too much in a particular spot near the center to the point where keeping a finger on it for more than a second is painful. WIll be returning this laptop. Shame, because it seemed great otherwise, but with wfh it doesn't seem reliable.Edit: Be advised, in case of such an issue, Amazon will REFUSE to replace your device. They wasted hours of my times asking me to do several steps and then at the end made me install a diagnostic application. When the diagnostic application said my system was fine, although the touchpad is literally burning, they said they can't do anything for me. Absolutely pathetic customer support. If I could give 0 stars, I would."
4,As expected the performance is top notch due to the new ryzen 4500u processor.The display is good with vibrant color accuracy.RAM is soldered to the motherboard so that's a problem..But SSD is upgradeable.The product includes the stylus in the box which is very helpful.I am using it for both gaming as well as coding purposes and I think it is a bang for bucks!! Since the last year envy model still priced the same and competing the price with us market is of no use. Since India has huge import charges. Overall the product is great. The only disappointment is the wifi should have been Intel Wi-Fi 6 rather than Realtek Wifi 5 ax... As the new windows 10 uograde is causing problems to the WiFi drivers for all Realtek Network adapters it is a problem. I think they should have chosen the intel wifi card 6 when thought of importing this product to India. It would be a 5/5 then.
3,I will never buy a laptop with less than 512GB Storage. Nice.And it's overpriced.
5,"Pros:1. Ryzen 4500u processor makes it more powerful than intel laptops twice its price. Especially its integrated graphics.2. Amazing screen. Can get cheaper 4500u laptops but if screen is important to you, this is worth it.3. 13+ hr battery life with light usage4. All metal body. Very durable. Great keyboard and speakers. Great Pen.5. Looks!!!! Stylish and slim.Cons:1. Less thermal efficiency due to its slimness. Gets hot when on full load - like during gaming. But this is not the right laptop for heavy gamers anyways.2. Soldered RAM. Cannot be upgraded in future.3. Finger magnet4. No HDMI port. Need to use USB C to HDMI converter."
5,"If you want a ryzen 5 laptops, there are plenty of cheap options, the reason why this is priced at 74k is the robust build quality and  beautiful looks, the 13.3 inches (33.78 cm) display does the job well, little glossy but okay, the fonts on keyboard are really great, the backlit keyboard works fine. Touchpad is also awesome. The hinges, although little loose but is robust. If you have to add an external monitor you may have to buy one of the USB c hubs available on this site. The charger is also compact and does not weigh much.The laptop can be made a little lighter and HP could have added at least 512 GB of storage, other than that this is an awesome product"
2,Bought this laptop inspite of the reviews on Amazon because the online reviews were great and I was really curious about the new ryzen 5 chipsets and how they perform. Unfortunately the touch functionality does not work and I tried downloading all the drivers and updated the BIOS. Even tried reinstalling windows 10 and still nothing. Have requested for a replacement and will update once that happens.So far the conversation with Amazon technical support has been cordial and they're trying to help.But definitely not happy with HP support. Waited for almost an hour for someone to help and yet nothing.The low rating is for a faulty product and not for the laptop itself.Will certainly review the status and update.ThanksUpdate: returned it and picked up the 512gb storage option. Also has 400 nits brightness which is a better experience than this one with 300 nits.. only complaint is I wish they'd offered this with wifi 6..
1,Not worth .. just been two days chromeBrowser hangs frequently no other applications are running poor performance heating issue .. too low battery backup and takes more time to fully charge..
5,Great little laptop with high performance. I generally use it as a travel backup for my desktop. I have not seen any performance issue so far. Build quality has been top notch except small quality control issues in some places. HP makes good products generally and this laptop is not an exception.
3,"Amazon rdecreased the price by 5000 literally two days after I bought it  so I'm citting two stars since this was really bad I'm at a loss of 5000,all in all its a gud laptop"
4,"Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).Clarifications/issue points:1. It‚Äôs a plastic body and not aluminium.2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.4. There‚Äôs no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it‚Äôs body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.Pros:1. Configuration is best at this price level.2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.4. It‚Äôs light weight as it‚Äôs a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.6. Display is average and gets the job done.7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it‚Äôs expandable upto 1 TB.9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it‚Äôs a really well thought product by HP.I‚Äôll update this review after one month of usage."
1,"Different charger was sent in the box by Amazon and they were not ready to provide a replacement as I had open the laptop box.Later after several calls and struggle I was able to get the replacement and now, camera is not working for the laptop.Laptop's over-all performance is nice. Buy it from a HP showroom directly instead buying it from Amazon."
5,"Amazing laptop.. I ordered this laptop on its released date i.e. 24th feb seeing it's wonderful configuration.. I must say the decision was right..Thank u HP for this superfast laptop. And after so much of research, I think in HP this is the only laptop with high configuration (11th gen, 16gb ram, 512 SSD, 14 inch screen, light weight, finger sensor & Alexa inbuilt) under this budget."
4,"As soon as I found 11gen Gen i5 at ~62K I got stuck at it & after reading some initial reviews placed an order. Got it at promised time. Here's my review after 3 days.Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance. 1.4 Kg is not too light & noticeable. People complaining about placement of Power Key button beside delete button but believe me it'll hardly ever come your way. The plastic feels like metal. The screen doesn't lift keyboard. Typing is a pleasure.Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Finger print unlock is superfast. Apps opens in no time. Gestures works perfectly. All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram & 512 NvMe SSD.Features: Comes with ""Office Home & Student 2019"" (didn't checked is it lifelong). Dropbox 25GB for 1 year also available. Comes with some HP apps & Express VPN as well. HP quick drop helps you transfer files from your phone easily. It has Type C charging point but not sure if it is delivery charging or receiving charging point. Keyboard is backlit with two setting (full & med bright).Display: Didn't checked in daylight but at home it is very bright. Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure.Camera is 720p Camera is OK. Pictures & Videos are grainy. I won't be using it much so I'm fine with that.Speakers is unbelievably very loud & clear. At 67 its was reaching all across my apartment. Speakers are on the two sides below keyboard.Only drawback I noticed was charging pin is too tight to push & pull out.I will be posting more updates on performance, battery etc & also my overall experience as I keep using more & more.Update after 2 weeks:After lot of research & by doing practical I found that this Laptop can be charged by a Type-C charger. Believe me this is an exclusive piece of information, not many people knows this. HP call center didn't knew this, HP Showroom people don't know this, even when I asked question here someone provided wrong answer. This is an important information they should have mentioned in product detail that this Laptop supports Type C charging. I'm using HP original 65 W Type C power adapter to charge it. Attaching a photo. I did some research myself & found its USB Type C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. After reading this I ordered the Type C power adapter & it worked."
2,"If you are a College student or a professional who depends heavily on laptop for pretty much everyday then  this laptop is not for you. It hangs more often than it runs. Cannot install essential computer science software such as Eclipse or android studio because then this laptop just dies.I took this laptop thinking that it will have good performance based on its configuration.But if you are someone who wants to attend online classes or just browse, then you may go for this laptop."
5,"Very Thin, light weight, fast boot, fast shut down. Longer battery life. You will love watching full HD or 4K videos on this display.As I used for 2 days, so yet to validate battery strength on regular basis. I will share battery review after 1 week.16GB Ram, L3 8MB, 6 core Ryzen 5, NVME, good finger print lock.Delivered next day by Amazon.Keyboard gives initial impact that keys letters/numbers could be bolder. But with continued use you may find it comfortable. I think silver background and light black text may gives illusion of thin text on keys. It might be due to my use of complete black body laptop with white text keys earlier. But not big deal.Software is Win Home provided. Anti virus provided is McAfee which is one month free version. It could have been 1 year. Dropbox 12 month provided free, it could have been 1 month instead of McAfee. MS Office provided is desktop version. Office 365 is not included.I will recommend better you order laptop cushion cover and keyboard cover with this. This generation laptops are very delicate not sterdy as like before"
1,"The battery is gone in a month's time it was delivered on 5-Apr-201, hardware diagnosis says battery needs to be replaced. Have already faced issues where the keys just froze and had to contact support team."
5,11 Gen Laptop with 16GB RAM is a dream combination as of now. Good deal
4,HP Pavilion laptop is slim & look premium. It's design as similar to Apple Macbook Air. I had a another HP Pavilion laptop but it had a complaint that if you open the lap the keyboard cover will slightly bend. This HP Pavilion laptop solve it's problem.Advantage1. Light Weight2. Slim Body3. Great Display & Camera4. Enriched Bang & Olufsen sound5. Output heat is place between screenDisadvantage1. To make laptop slim they had to remove Lan/Ethernet2. The Key are white. Some time we have to turn off to see the letter of the key3. Need to buy Adapter for Lan/Ethernet supply4. There are 2 USB  & One Type C USB. If u need to connect more device buy a5. Some time it is hard to physical connect to USB AConclusion: Since it has some drawback. I did buy the product for it's price & it's Brand Also. I loved it
4,"I just see one month trial version of microsoft 365, it doesn't show me option to setup ms office. can some one help me on this?"
5,"Awesome features in this laptopScreen is delight, back lit keyboard is awesome, finger print recognition is really good. I cannot imagine I could get all these features at this price. Super fast drive, free office what else you need.... 16 gb ramBeen using this for more than 2 weeks.. I am really really happy. On top of it awesome customer care service on what's app"
5,"Did a lot of research and landed on this laptop. I am not a gamer and didn't want a gaming laptop or a laptop with a dedicated graphics card. If that's your thing, then probably look elsewhere. Was not able to find this configuration anywhere for this price - 512gb SSD, 16gb RAM with i5 processor. It's an absolute beast. Everything flies and windows is looking so much better now (I was coming from a macbook pro). I was taken a back at how good this thing is. Does all the daily tasks without a sweat. The audio output is also decent (not great). Has a USB C port which can be used for charging (haven't tried this, but someone else had put a detailed review with this feature - check it out).One con: If you close the lid and connect it to an external monitor, the wifi speed drops, if you're a bit far from your router. Let me explain: my office room is a bit far away from the router (don't ask me why I set it up like this). I took the laptop there and connected it to my monitor and closed the lid and kept it on a stand. The wifi became very slow. I disconnected the monitor and opened the lid and checked to see that the wifi speed was triple now. Googled and saw that the wifi antennas are below the trackpad - so someone suggested to keep the trackpad part of the laptop on top while placing it on the stand. This helped a bit; in the end, I kept the lid a wee bit open on the stand, and this solved the issue."

5,"This is an excellent product. Appearance looks great. Start and shutdown in a blink due to NVMe SSD. All the configurations including RAM, processor, ports are well tested and optimized. Very light waight and portable for frequent travellers."
1,"Good laptop with a decent hardware spec, was able try out some heavy graphics games and sever configuration. The disappointment was the promised MS word processing software with life long validity. Where the seller did not share the product key. This is a common scenario as many other buyers are also complaining. License software subscription is around INR 1200 per year, so please factor in that also in ur owner ship cost.Again this kind of behaviour from one of the reputed sellers on the platform is disappointing."
4,"Bought this laptop DV0543TU during GreatIndianSale-2021 at 54k(including bank offers). Apart from bank offer, I also got free PRIME membership for 1 yr and Audible membership for 6 months bundled with this laptopü§©. Used this laptop for 1 week and below is detailed review üë®‚ÄçüíªPROS üëç- Expandable option available for SSD and RAM. 476 GB of available SSD memory.- Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance- Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Applications starts/loads fast- Applications like Python, PyCharm,Photoshop etc loads quickly and runs efficiently without any hiccups- Speakers are also loud, although bottom firing- Microsoft integration is seamless, hence setup is quick.- USB Type-C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. You can also charge from Type-C port.- Battery last average around 5-6 hours (however depends upon usage patterns)CONS üëé- Charging pin, USB slots is too tight to push & pull out- Does not have SD card slot or fingerprint reader, images shown in AMAZON doesn't have correct images.- No camera shutter/privacy button- If HP doesn't bundle bag, they should atleast provide a carry case or sleeveüö© Keeping aside the cons, the HP Pavilion DV0543TU with (8GB/512GB/i5-11) can be ideal machine for buyers looking for a portable yet powerful machine without a hefty price. It's like using a trimmed down version of HP ENVY premium laptop without compromising on processing power üíª !!!"
2,"Update after one month usage - MS Office 2019 preinstalled edition became unlicensed version within 30 days and refused to activate. HP support shared their product sheet that stated that this laptop came only with a trial version of MS Office 2019. Now I am chasing seller Appario Retail to honour the commitment.Bad experience after paying high price (around ‚Çπ67,000) for preinstalled genuine software.Other wise product has sleek looks, superfast fingerprint scanner, very good display, very responsive touchpad, decent (but tinny) speakers, USB C and barrel plug charging options and under 10 second boot up (SSD drive). Preloaded with Win10 Home and MS Office (not sure whether trial or full version). Drawbacks - weighs 1.42 kg, base gets warm rather quickly and so does the power adapter. Decent for a college student."
1,"Worst Amazon experience ever. This laptop arrived with a defective battery and even after 3 hours of charging, the battery level remained at 65% when the power cord was removed from supply. Immediately on removing the power cord the laptop shuts down. There is no matter any charge left on the laptop battery which seems to be defective. Never expected such a faulty product from HP. Very pathetic and really disappointed. Could not return it or replace it without booking an inspection appointment. Waiting for them to arrive and inspect it. Never buy HP products as they dont appear to be QC ed properly. Could not give a negative rating so selecting 1 star.Edited - The inspection happened 2 days after requesting for replacement. The replacement laptop was approved and ordered. It took another 2 days for Amazon to ship and deliver. However, the delivery person refused to hand over the replacement and accept the defective laptop as he could not power it on!!The actual defect was the battery and there was no way he could start it or power on without using the external power cord.The delivery person left without accepting the inspected and marked defective laptop. I‚Äôm still waiting for confirmation that the laptop will be replaced. Pathetic experience from both Amazon and HP. Would have given negative 10 stars for Earth‚Äôs customer centric company if possible."
4,"Cons:This laptop has rectangular display and if you were using MacBook 13, you might get surprised to see this screen feels smaller than that. So I suggest checking this out in physical store before buying.I did not like the mouse trackpad as it‚Äôs not very responsive and sometimes gives wrong feedback.Battery is decent, If not the best.Pros:Thin, sleek, lightweight and handy.Windows package is good with free office.Laptop in general is quite fast"
5,"Writing this review after 15 days of usage. The box contains the laptop and the charging cable. The laptop weighs  exactly 1.4 KG, and it's quite nice. It has all the specifications as advertised, i.e. 16 GB ram, and 500 GB NVME SSD. It does not have IR camera so no face unlocking will support. The finger print sensor is fast. Office 2019 is pre-installed and needs only to be activated, so while booting up for the first time it's best to have a mail id ready. the USB type C port is good and I have tested with data transfer only, not display and power output, although according to blogs and forums it will support both. Battery life is not completely tested but it's fairly ok, as of now I have got backup worth of definitely 6 hrs."
1,"HP would not consider dead pixel in warranty as they need 2 dead pixels. Above that if in case there is a dead pixel, then they will try their best to put up many reasons to not entertain it in warranty, calling it customer induced damage.. LOL..Buy this at your own risk from Amazon. Who knows what i faced was because of Amazon induced damage during delivery...Someone tell HP that most common reason for a dead pixel is a MANUFACTURING DEFECT.."
1,"A bad choice purchase from amazon. After a week of use, the laptop screen display goes off every 5 to 10 minutes. When it goes off, I need to switch the laptop on, the display comes back and after 5 minutes again goes off, again switch it on.  Tired of it. Frustrated. Don't buy electronics from Amazon."
2,It‚Äôs look like renewed laptop because laptop charging jack is loose and left side speaker sounds like it‚Äôs tear. Bad sound quality  and finger sensor quality look like 2011 touch phone of wing and any Chinese phone touch. Waste of money and one more thing day by day Amazon product quality getting poor
4,"Product design looks good, good display, tacky keyboard and good battery.The price could have been better.And missing on finger scanner!! This was missing information from the Q&AAlso office 2019 is just installed, but not activated. Microsoft account is required to activate. And If you are using a license elsewhere against the Microsoft account, then you will have trouble activating.. Factor this please"
5,"Like:Booting time is very less.Light weightSuper fastFinger touch unlock is super fastDislike:180 hinges are missingOpening lid is not designed properly, bit difficult to open the lid"
1,THE PROCESSOR MENTIONED ON WEBSITE IS OF 4.2GHZ BUT WHAT I RECIEVED IS OF 2.4GHZ
1,Had an issue with the product and the HP service support is horrible.I have called their support number about 10 times and written multiple emails. It‚Äôs been more than 10 days and nothing much has happened.Now the laptop is jst a piece of waste affecting my kids online school.
5,"This is a clean and elegant device. The keyboard strokes are so smooth and makes you to type more. Weighing at 1.75KG it handles with ease. The FHD display with thin bezels gives you an immersive viewing experience. 16GB of RAM, SSD and Ryzen 5 gives you instant responses. It also upgraded itself to Windows 11. One issue was with '@' and '#' as they couldn't be typed. HP Support asked to uninstall and reinstall keyboard driver to solve the issue. However the laptop seems to work fine now even without doing it. Fingerprint reader is fast. The aesthetics is great minus the stickers. Overall a worthy purchase. If you are eligible for exchange please use that option and use credit card for getting a better deal."
1,"Giving 1 start to this not because of any performance issue to hardware defect, but because of the misleading advertisement which is been done for this laptop on Amazon.I purchased this on 10th Oct 2021, below are the specs which are incorrectly mentioned by the seller.1) 95 W TGP.  I mean seriously , 95W TGP for GTX 1650.???2) 100 % SRGB. They themselves mentioned that it has 45% NTSC and 250 nits of brightness, how on earth can this panel have 100% SRGB.3) 4 Zone RGB keyboard. I have attached an image of this laptop and also confirmed this from lenovo customer care, this laptop only has white backlit keyboard. But in the product description here in amazon you can clearly see that its mentioned that it has a four zone RGB keyboard.Performance and quality wise the laptop is nice, but this kind of misleading advertisement is not expected from amazon. And this should be reported."
5,"I'm writing this review after using this laptop for almost 1 and a half week.PROS:1) Build, looks, hardware:Sturdy build, minimal flex, looks great, hinge goes 180 and feels sturdy.Keyboard is nice to type, has two levels of brightness. Touchpad is good, no creaky noises from the chassis, 4 cooling vents.Fan noise minimal even at load. E-Privacy shutter for camera. 4 Usb 3.2 gen 1 ports and has all the ports you need. Charging brick is of 230watts which is super fast. Speakers are pretty good, can be tuned via Nahimic audio software.2) Display:Comes with 120Hz BOE NV156FHM-NX1.45% NTSC, 63% SRGB, 250 Nits brightness, response rate 14.9ms.3) Battery life-60whr battery. (could've been 90 whr in this price range, but its fine)Battery Life (70% brightness, startup apps off, better battery + balance mode, hybrid mode on, keyboard lighting level 1)8.5 -9 hours watching offline movies on VLC with airplane mode on.7-8 hours reading PDFs, making notes, little browsing, office apps.5-6 hours light usage like browsing, listening to songs, YouTube, background apps open like discord, telegram etc.5-7 hours YouTube playback4 hours medium usage2-3 hours heavy usage1 hour gaming.*Battery life heavily DEPENDS on what you're doing. For most people, it will be 3-5 hours.4) Gaming Performance and outstanding thermals-Hardly any difference between 1650 and 1650ti, and this 1650 is as good as a 1650ti on other laptops as you can run your display directly via Nvidia graphics using the MUX swith/hybrid mode so you'll get an FPS boost in games which is the main highlight of this device.Not much of a gamer myself, bought this mainly for productivity but played Witcher 3 at ultra, both CPU and GPU temps were not even close to 60 degress.CONS:1)The PriceIt should be around 65-68k. But lenovo does provide better build quality and speakers so its kind of debatable.2)Doesn't come with an HDD like in the 2020 Legion.3)Should have a 4-Zone RGB backlit keyboard variant.(Subjective for people having different opinions and needs).*IT IS MENTIONED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION THAT THIS LAPTOP COMES WITH A 4-ZONE RGB KEYBOARD, 100% SRGB, 95W TGP ETC WHICH ARE COMPLETELY WRONG AND MISLEADING. THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER WITH THIS PRODUCT BUT IT FEELS LIKE AMAZON ALONG WITH THIS SELLER IS CHEATING THEIR COSTUMERS*"
5,"My first gaming laptop purchase, it was this or Dell G 5515 5600h which is cheaper than this by 6K (when I bought), I didnt like the color or look of Dell G 5515 and its charger looked bulky n big.Display - Its a very good display only drawback is the brightness, 250 nits is not sufficient, brightness level should be kept above 80% for normal viewing.Keyboard: Excellent, typing experience is great, with good palm rest. only white lit (doesn't matter)Weight: not bulky , easy to carry 2.4 KgCharger: 230W, slim but heavy brick, with a very long cordPorts: many USB ports, you wont run out of it.Battery: 60 WHr, 4-5 Hr of normal usageUpgrade: one empty RAM slot and one empty SSD slot for upgrade.Webcam: 720p its just there..Speakers: Loud enoughOverall worth the price"
5,"Laptop looks awesome.. bus price bhi achi rakhna, 5600h 1650 should come under 70k. If lenovo really wants to sell laptop and make their reputation in the market.. they should provide more stocks in decent price."
4,Laptop will be worth only if it comes under 65k. Hp is providing that spec in 62k. Waiting for the price reveal
1,"Totally overpriced and the specs are misleading..the seller is totally lying to all the viewers, it's not less than fraud... pathetic"
5,"After my 13inch MacBook I have tried several window laptops HP, Dell, Asus, Acer but this is first laptop that has amazed me with its extreme engineering design and a display to die for, stunning colours and best sound ever on a laptop, this beats MacBook retina display anyday and fast charge is amazing. I think it should be priced at 80k but surprisingly it's being sold at 69,999. The ports are more than adequate, the thunderbolt port and charging via USB is cherry on cake, fast charge, hdmi usb 3.2 port, only thing I felt was ram 8gb is just okay. You will forget hp, Lenovo and Dell and now I felt cheated on getting those mediocre specs and quality of laptops at 80k. You will not regret a bit once you hold this piece of beauty in your hands. WiFi 6 BT 5. Close your eyes and go for this you will love it and will become your routine companion. I have gray colour one and it's best. Fully recommend this laptop. Thanks Vaio for this amazing device."
1,"I had vaio gifted by my company. It only takes 8months for the screen hinge to break apart. The customer service is horrible. They take several months to change it. By the time the hinge is replaced the warranty/ guarantee is over. Now starts the fun. 3more months the hinge breaks again :D . The repair cost is extremely high. Its a flimzy laptop, Very delicate. You will notice when u have your hands on the laptop. The speed is also not great!"
5,It‚Äôs an amazing product. I have not used such a fast laptop before. Everything happens so fast that it‚Äôs unimaginable. The setup is also very fast. I will recommend this for everyone.The only glitch I have is that the office 365 as promised on the site is not available and I didn‚Äôt get the key to activate it. I have written to vaio and still awaiting response.
4,This is not the VAIO that I am used to - but it has all features for my day to day needs . It is value for money for everyday business use . Light weight and fast . Keyboard is not as sleek as the old Vaio's Beware of  Office 365 license : I have not been provided activation key for Office 365 which was a part of the deal.  Service response from VAIO is not fast. I am not sure why they advertised and charged for the Office 365
5,"I am using vaio laptop not this model ryzen 5( purchased 2 month ago ) and i feel best laptop according performance and smoothness of workgrate looks ,screen &fast.specially their service - once i call service centre technician came to my house (they have 2 years home service )"
5,Overall nice laptop with good performance and good battery backup. Speaker sound is low. Display is good with fast finger print sensor.
4,Product is ok.but Microsoft account can be set up with product key code.Pl send same immediately.shall try and then only comment
1,The worst laptop ever. New issues everyday. I regret buying this. Never buying sony again. Better go for some other brand.
1,Over slow product
5,All over good deal... Value for money and model is dynamic as well.
4,I have selected emi option. As mentioned on Amazon is not the actual amount. You need to pay above that amount.Amazon need to mention proper amount detail.
5,"Delivered in Just 2 days,this is the first time i am using MSI laptop and Trust me ..one of the best display and Cool Keyboard.. Obviously Good for gaming and other things.."
5,Just go for it amazing productPros: i7 10th gen is best processor in this price rangeYou can add storage and most importantly ram is expandable upto 64gb which is freaking awsome.144hz screen is flawless.Now cons: material quality is metal but low level plastic is used with it. Battery drains even in normal usage.touchpad in not upto the mark like it works but not that much smooth.
5,"Although it's a good laptop.For gaming and everything else, it's Good and in this price it's a good deal. At Amazon it's very good deal."
4,"Best laptop for WFH use. Best keyboard,display is good, Microsoft Office 2019 provided, BACKLIGHT KEYBOARDS IS ALSO THEIR FOR 60K MODEL. Charging is fast, takes 1.5 hour to full charge. And battery back up is upto 4-5 hours.Boots up in seconds."
5,"Good laptop but some pieces are faulty for mic and speakers, it was happened with me, but got replaced with new piece on next day, thanks for understanding issue and  arranging replacement."
5,"Sleek And Good Build QualityFast, Precise and SharpGreat Display [You can tweak the color balance Using Color Calibration Settings in Windows]Battery Backup is well tuned depending on the usage. If you just require Word Processing, Browsing and reading pdfs then it can easily last for more than 6 hours and upto 8 HoursGot it for 47000 after exchange and DiscountFinal Verdict : Amongst the best in segment. Can easily beat HP in looks and Design. One exceptional product from Lenovo"
2,Product is good but Amazon's hidden policy might force you to cry..be very carefulGenuine review
1,"Even upon contacting Lenovo support, issue is not yet resolved since 13/10/2021.. would suggest not to purchase Lenovo products .And even the laptop have 2 year warranty, still lenovo team is unable to resolve. Shame on Lenovo and Retailer selling it. Both are creating bad image of Amazon"
5,Till now it's working perfect.
2,"Not able to switch it on, now need to contact service centre, hope they respond"
4,Laptop is good as expected except battery. For extensive use on battery may not stay more than 2 hours. For simple use may stay 3 to 4 hours after full charge.
1,Very poor sound. Very poor support. So far I had 2 keyboard issues. Only remote support. They would make you a IT support engineer to create bootable disc etc. Finally you may need to visit the support centre. Very bad product.
4,"Build quality is not good, performance and battery seems to be okay."
5,Good laptop in this budget ...i was going for a asus laptop but shifted to this because of the ips screen ... it's loaded with windows 10 but while setting up i got the option for windows 11 as well
3,Mouse Touch pad is very shaking and bit loose
4,Overall good laptop.Only cons I have experienced are:Low peak brightness(300 nits)Low peak volume.
2,The product says 1.4 kg but it is much heavier than that. I wished a lightweight laptop but this disappointed me.
5,worth buying for.
5,Every thing i felt is good but alexa is not working rest of the thing is good ..
5,Overall performance is good according to Laptop Price.
5,Paisa vassoool laptop......
4,Back lignt is not is working
5,Good product
1,"Very bad product. I bought this product on 2 Oct 2021 ,I got this product dead i.e. product is ON only when I connect to charger and speaker is very low sound ,I complaint to Amazon customer service they assigned me replacement product after verification but next te courier boy didn't return this product he said your product is dead so I am unable to pickup this product.Again I call Amazon customer service next time they said your is returned to us but still next time same issue courier boy did not pickup my product he said your product is dead so I can't pick this product .This scenario happened again and again still my product didn't pickup.Every time Amazon customer service saying I will arrange new slot for pickup and also saying plz truth me.They also saying your product is expensive that's why you faced this type of problem.so friends if I buy expensive product We will faced this type of product.Very bad service of Amazon."
5,"There is nothing in it that I can give dislike about..... within 15 sec, it restart while others laptop taking 1-2 min. Speaker is quite good what expected....camera is just okay. You will have to use flat stiff board below the laptop to maintain air flow....as you can't use it resting it over bed as it bloked fans openings.But there should be user guide for some of new features which are unknown for a new buyer."
5,Must buy for WFH purpose.. Except Sound quality everything is good.. Battery life is excellent Lenovo provides the best customer service aswell..
5,A very good laptop. I played minecraft even in shaders it didn't lagged. Let me tell some pros and cons.Pros- i) Multitasking taskpad ii) backlit keyboard. iii)impressive display. iv) Windows 11 supported v) camera shutter vi) good gaming experienceCons- i) taskpad sometimes stop working ii) It lags (for some seconds) when I turn on my camera (in hd) in zoom. iii) Windows 10 pro should be thereTip- Buy it online because I spend 62000 on the offline shop. You have to give 65000. I got in 62000 because the retailer was known to me
3,I just bought this laptop and it was lagging for 2 sec after every click so I updates the latest version of windows 10 few drivers and after restarting it a couple of times the lag is no more but it's still 1sec lag. Now that the windows 11 is out will it replaced even if update and still lags?
1,You need to get ready atleast 25 minutes before the class for children if you are going to use this laptop.
1,Tooo slow .....
2,Good product
4,Don't buy the hdd version cause it's slow af. Beside that everything is fine.
5,"As far as i used i think this laptop is fine,‚Ä¢Build quality is good but hinges are little weak so display wobbles‚Ä¢Display is good and is quite big and i like itEdit 1  I checked my display model using Hwinfo and found out that it has 6 bit china made chi mei display, but Good 8 bit display for boe display for other victus variantNot a good move Hp‚Ä¢Speakers are also good‚Ä¢Trackpad is good‚Ä¢Laptop keyboard is excellent‚Ä¢Value for money as you are getting newer cpu and sufficient amount gpu performanceEdit 1:Hp has wantedly capped 5600h to 30w to avoid higher temps which performs just like 4600H . So if you are thinking to buy this laptop dont buy this as it has more cons than pros.Even IdeaPad with 4600h gives same performanceBuy IdeaPad 3 gaming or legion 5 or acer nitro 5 instead of this laptopYou will praise me for neglecting this laptop and buying a better value laptop"
5,"It's great for gaming as well as for daily activities, the screen wobbles a bit if touched and is slightly heavy but I think as per the price it's great and does all tasks very smoothly.UpdateGames running smoothly with good graphics and colour accuracy, no problem at all in daily tasks."
4,"It's a good gamming laptop (normal gamming) things i love in this laptop is its battery life,thermals,ms office life time validity and it comes with a decent looks. if you're student and search for good gamming and normal use it is the best but if you want only a gamming laptop then go to hp pavilion 15-ec2004AX model in flipkart it comes with same specifications and includes refresh rate of 144hz in 64k price"
2,Laptop looks ok.Charger is looks like power bank. Heated soon after 15 mints
4,Build quality is good.its not what everyday dad said but screen does wobble. Overall it's a nice package
3,"Screen wobbles like anything if you switch on the fan . Hp shud note that not everyone in india use centralaised ac without ceiling fan . i think the loosened the screen hinge so that u can open/ lift the screen without applying pressure or holding the keybord , and they have ended up creating a very loose screen which wobbles like anything . has anyone found a solution to this"
5,"Advantages:CheapPowerfulYou could buy this laptop and add a RAM stick later to increase the RAM further.Disadvantages:Chargers heats up, although it's probably heat resistantLaptop heats up while playing CPU intensive games, so you gonna place it a bit above the surface to allow the fans to cool it.Screen wobbles a bit if moved quickly. Not too unstable though and will not wobble during use, unless you literally smash yiur keyboard while typing. Might as well smash your laptop then."
3,"Wobbling effect is very prominent and no doubt in that. Just switch on your fan and you can see it clearly. If still you can't notice it, then start your webcam and see the earthquake on your screen. Apart from this everything else is very nice. Amazon offer 14% off, Exchanged my 10 years old asus laptop for 12k, coupon discount 2k, some more discount with credit card.... Got it @Rs. 51,740. Thanks to Amazon for excellent service and offer. Delivery received on 10.08.2021. Finally, you may ignore the wobble effect for this configuration at this budget. Even though the screen will be having wobble effect but it's not affecting while doing any work on laptop. Opening the lid a bit extra reduces the wobble effect to a great extent. If getting the lappy on a good offer price, then go for it."
3,First of all  there's no doubt that the product is cool and awesome but something I would like to share is that this product can give you problems with one very basic thing... The BIOS ... Be very careful with the bios and know that this laptop does not have a separate cmos battery on the motherboard so if you disconnect the main battery while doing upgrade of any kind the CMOS will reset. And Becareful with updating the BIOS software from windows always use windows 20H2 version . Donot upgrade to windows 21H1 before doing bios update. My laptop unit failed the update due to this and now is in coma. HP is not very helpful and fast with their service so it's more than 2 weeks now that they haven't sent the new replacement motherboard yet. Its really sad that brands like HP hode this kind of things. Before update or upgrade make sure you know everything about the product. And all these tiny details as they are not mentioned even in HP's own guide videos available on YouTube.
1,Good laptop overall but for a gaming laptop with such high specs refresh rate of 60 Hz makes no sense and to not list that in the specs is very unprofessional. Did not expect this from HP. Please update your specs to provide this information to your customers
4,"Amazon delivery was poor. Package damaged, but no issues in product.Product is a beast. If you are a student, just go for it, I got this for 66.5K. Base model of victus, yet delivered mid-high range performance. Speed stunning ! Display was good, but for gamers it's not so.. limited to 60Hz.150W smart charger doing good, Battery Ok performance.I got HP mouse G200 free with victus, mouse was big and too heavy to handle, it have excellent control."
3,Pros-1)Pricing was good for these specs.2)Many use full app pre installed.3)Good upgradation level with 2 ssd slot and 2 ram slot.4)Simple and classic design and look.5)keyboard fell good and trackpad is also very responsive.cons-1)Build quality is not strong and durable for travelling.2)Ventilation and cooling is not good. Playing games and quickly they temperature of cpu reaches from 50 to 90 degree Celsius with in 30 minutes.3)Not good performance when unplugged from the charger .They performance drop is dramatic. Playing games like control and fortnight and they fps reaches 1/4 .Control at medium settings reaches from 45 to 12 fps and fortnight from 75 to 30 fps and bellow.
5,"- Built like a tank- Light wobble (even 13 inch laptops wobble), but even the Macbook Pro wobbles- Excellent crisp sound by Bang and Olufsen- Super fast performance- MS Office pre-installed- Efficient cooling system- Excellent matt finish, lesser chance of scratches- Beautiful display, plays 8k videos like a boss- Has all the ports one needs- Upgradable to Windows 11"
1,The product title have Flicker Free Display which normally used for high refreshed rate monitors. I contacted amazon but they refused to help.
4,"CPU is locked at 25/30watts out of the box. Can be unlocked easily to 55watts using Ryzen controller. Doesn't seem to hit above 95 degrees at full fan speed and cpu stress test.GPU is great as well, although it is 45w. The 5500m may be better for performance, but it also sucks up 85watts, taking a toll on battery.Keyboard is snappy, isn't as deep(lesser travel distance) as Asus tuf and strix keyboards. White backlight only, but it is even and solid.It is built extremely well, little to no flex anywhere. The screen does wobble a little till 90 degrees and reduces wobbling after that angle.LARGE trackpad. It seems like it's double the size of the pavilion trackpad. Rough surface doesn't feel too good tho, I'll be applying a skin/protector over it. It's very accurate.Battery just doesn't seem to run out. I set TDP to 10w in Ryzen Controller on battery and went down from 100% to 77% in 2 hours running Google Meet, Word, and Whiteboard and showed me 7hr 3 mins remaining at 77%. Brightness was set at 60% with kb backlight off. I think one can easily get 10 hours+ of battery life if you set the TDP to 3watts(at the cost of performance) and disable dgpu. Should be fine for most word, excel, meeting(zoom/google/msft teams) at 3 watts.Display is honestly not that great. It's a 6 bit panel and banding is apparent on even the most basic greys. 60hz only and stock display configuration is garbage. Set it to 7800 white, saturation to 110 in AMD Radeon software in the custom display colour options, to make it better. Still is a bad panel honestly. I would suggest getting a 144hz 100% srgb panel replacement from the HP service center whenever you feel this isn't cutting it.The feel and build of this is amazing and nowhere near the pavilion. This feels in between the legion and the strix g15"
3,"Below points to be noted1. Heating issue: I am doing normal office work in standard conditions, system heats.2. Screen wobbles, it's manageble by the way.3. Due to heating performance suffersI compared lenovo legion in the same conditions with victus and found that legion is far better than victus.Another important point is after sale support is useless, if someone having nearby service center than it's fine otherwise it's very painfull, Dell support is best in my experience."
1,"I purchased an HP Victus laptop less than a month ago which has already started encountering issues. The camera does not work and an error message of ""Camera not found"" pops up in my face every time I try to access it. Upon attempting to contact service centers, nobody picks up. I have already tried twice or thrice all the troubleshooting steps mentioned on the HP website. Unfortunately the Whatsapp support team is not very helpful either, as they only tell us to repeat the troubleshooting steps.Upon purchasing such an expensive laptop, a bottomline expectation that it would not face problems for at least an year or two is developed, but if such nags start popping up in just a month, I would be extremely willing to get a replacement or a refund so I can purchase a better functioning laptop.Case no. of the complaint- 5073641563Country-  IndiaProduct Name- Victus by HP 16.1 inch Gaming Laptop PC 16-e0000 (2V8Z8AV)Product Line- Gaming NotebooksProduct Number- XX4P2PASerial Number- XXX128F3JPFailure Description- Camera not working. Error message of ""We can't find your camera"" pops up."
1,"After some bios updates pushed by HP ,the system won't start .Raised a complaint with HP and they shceduled a site visit in 48 hrs , today is fourth day since the complaint and no show from HP."
5,"I am not a gamer. I purchased this laptop to do the Coding activities. I do the Frondend development using reactJs ,Node and Docker and it seems everything is pretty fast and has no lag at all.The Browsers and VS Code open very fast and overall very good performance.The Touchpad is very bad .its not up to the mark of my 10 year old Sony Vaio. screen is average"
5,"The screen wobble is not noticeable while typing/using the laptop. I could only notice it if I intentionally flick the screen.The display quality is great, battery life is great, performance is amazing.The laptop doesn't look too big compared to 15.6 inch laptops.Great battery life for a gaming laptop.The keyboard is satisfying to type on, and the touchpad is quite big and responds well.The surface of the laptop is prone to fingerprint marks.Cooling is done well as temperature goes down in seconds once we stop heavy usage.Webcam is average quality.Probably the best laptop available in this price right now."
4,"I have been using HP Victus laptop since a week. My preliminary views are as under:1) Battery Life - this is the best gaming laptop in terms of battery life. 70WHR battery last for 8 hours on normal use and 5 hours on gaming which is best out of all. So will give 5 out of 52) screen - the laptop screen is good for use at home and not outside. 250 nite brightness is not good for using it outside. Further, 60Hz screen is not apt for proper gaming,  it will give less FPS. All other players are giving min 120 hz in this price range. So will give 3  out of 5.3. GAMING - Have played games in medium settings. Worked fine. But it get heated much, so need to improve on thermals. Graphic card GTX 1650 works well. Also 60 hz panel. So will give 3 out of 54. MS office - Best part of this laptop is free lifetime ms office 2019. No gaming laptop in this price range give this. So will give 5 out of 5.5. Weight and Looks - This weights almost 2.5 kgs which is really high, I guess due to battery. Looks give office feeling and not gaming feeling which is good for me.6. Built quality - Built is ok. As most reviewers said, screen wobbles even with fan operation. Fully plastic and hinges are not strong. Still you will have no problem in working with it. So will give 3 out of 5.7. Sound Quality - The sound quality is ok types for gaming laptop. The sound is not too great and you will have to use headphones for gaming as well as movie streaming. So will give 3 out of 5.8. Conclusion - in totality, I will give 4 out of 5. For those who want to use it for office work, playing medium setting gamew, this is best in price and features. Not for hard-core gamers. For gaming, buy HP Pavillion 5600H with same price with 144 Hz screen."
5,"1. Very very powerful, R5 5600h more than an i7 9th or 10th gen H (geek bench)2. Battery life is good, around 5-6 hrs on battery saver mode ( uninstall the hp omen gaming hub and click on battery to adjust performance, was getting higher benchmark score on doing this and also battery lasts more )3. Screen is wobbly but in normal use I don't notice it very much4. Screen quality is very good5. Speakers are good6. 8 GB ram is really good, can run multiple apps simultaneously7. Not that heavy for college8. Instant boot up and shut down/sleep wake9. I Love the Huuuuuuge track pad (one of the best features and it's quality is also good)10. Camera and mic decent"
1,"The setupService provided  was not up to the mark. Many aspects were not attended. Technician wanted to hurriedly leave, stating that he has to attend two more cases.Issue was informed over phone. Refund promised has not been credited to my account."
1,"After Bios update I got motherboard issue within one and half month. I have raised complaint and service engineer visited within two days but he raised request for motherboard replacement, still now I didn't get the replacement. I disappointed with HP service and product."
3,"For gamers-1. Did all the stress test and the fans were working perfectly, they get loud sometimes but not a big deal.2. Thermals are okish, personally did not faced any over heating, but could've been better.3. Screen is the best part, it's big, colour rich and good viewing angles.4. Wobble is there, under fan it wobbles, but not a major issue can ignore it, should not be a deal breaker for anyone, hinge passes the one hand open test.For gaming overall good.For non gamers or casual gamers1. Do not buy, you may be enticed by its processor and big battery, which lives upto their expectations.2. Everyday task are handled like a pro, multiple tabs on brave browser were working without any lags.3. Windows crashed few times but it's on windows really.4. The main reason I do not recommend is wifi receptivity. It's really poor, the realtek wifi card is shit, if you are a normal user or a professional one looking for light gaming now and then, this weak wifi will disappoint you.5. If you can live with wifi issue( which is stupid because then might as well buy a desktop) go for it, please check the warranty."
4,"It's been 2 months since I bought this laptop and honestly speaking I am more than happy with it's performance whether be it gaming, programming or multimedia consumption, it outstands the competition.Pros :1) Battery life : 6-7 hours for normal usage like multimedia and programming. I have not done gaming much on this laptop but yeah I am sure it would definitely give around 3-3.5 hours of backup.2) Display : Seamless display. Although this does not have a 144Hz panel, it does not bother much unless you are a hardcore gamer and FPS matters to you more than your life(just kidding). Display is great.3) Heating : Let's just box it and keep it aside. Although the visuals show 5 way cooling(which is there in the 3060 model only) the cooling in this is apt for the tasks which I mentioned above.4) Build : Although the full body is plastic, it's feels and looks quite premium and the plastic used is of good quality.5) Overall Performance : Trust me you can go for it without a doubt.Cons :1) Weight : The weight is a whopping 2.5kgs which is a problem for carrying around but if you don't move much. It would not be an issue2) Performance (For Hardcore Gamers) : You do not get the performance mode for gaming as the above models do as the performance mode requires more power i.e. the 200w brick but in this you get only the 150w brick.Well as the rating suggests this is much above than good and slightly below perfect as nothing is perfect. Cheers."
5,"I'm not a gamer so I can't review that side. I bought this for development purpose, as far as my experience this laptop is a budget Beast .... Which is worth every penny you spend.I saw in many YouTube videos that this laptop has more screen wobble issues.. but that's not what it is .. I haven't felt any such issues till now..The keyboard comes with a white backlight which can be turn on and off .. their is no option to adjust the backlight brightness .The screen is amazing with its 16 inch  full hd panel with nano bezzels, including a web camera.If your budget is between 60k to 75k go for this laptop .. and also check it's 3050 graphic processor version.."

5,"This is my first laptop and i got it @57600 including bank offersPros:-1:-value for money.2:-simple disign if you not want gaming look.3:-battery performance is Excellent you cannot expect more than this in gaming laptop.(Battery last long upto 5-6 hours easily while multitasking,if you watch movies and youtube it will give you 6 -7 hour easily or more.4:-decent build quality far better than hp pavilion.CONS:-1:- screen wobbling is there ,if you put laptop under the fan with full speed it wobbles alot .2:-Charging adapter heat quickly but its not that big problem.might be issue for those who wantto buy this for only gaming purpose3:-Normal 60 hz display no fast refresh rate but if you don't want to do heavy gaming it is not a big  problem for you.Thanks guys""And if you want to consider this laptop go for it value for money product if you got this under ""62k"".And only consider this if your first priority is not gaming yeah it is capable for gaming but you have better option such as ""hp Pavilion  144hz"""
4,"Battery backup is near about 3 HourNo backlight keyboardLaptop is sexy, cute  and solid build qualityCharger is ugly. I think connector will loose its integrity if u dont treat it like baby dollNo heat during chrome surfing, video watching and normal work. But while updating windows  and running BlueStacks fan exhaust little heat.Anti virus and Asus app is using 20-30% of Ram installed that is bad  i will remove it after warranty period expires.Overall its there there for i5 10 genration for 51k"
4,A light weight laptop. Heating issues are there on heavy usages like gaming. For regular uses it is the best. I am managing my work from home.Pros:1. Battery backup came 5hrs for me.2. Display supported YouTube 4k videos.3. Light weight as notebook.4. No lag/struck for my daily office work (developer using VS & SQL).Cons:1. No backlit keyboard.2. No sd card reader as shown in site.3. Fan will exhaust a little bit heavy on using any games/bluestacks/windows updates.I don‚Äôt think these are cons for this price range laptops.Overall for 51k price I‚Äôm satisfied for my daily use. (4.5/5)
5,Liking the laptop so far. No lags. Looks sleak and classy. Portable to move around with.
1,"Having issues in camera since purchased.Asus customer service is not supportive.After 1 month of calling one operator came and by watching YouTube video try to resolve it, within 3days again camera is not working. I think it's a detective product. NEED A REPLACEMENT."
3,Cons: Horrible display not good even for watching movie. Not good to be viewed from different angles.No backlit keyboardScreen cannot be opened to 180 degree.Pros: Best price for an i5 processor.Microsoft 2019 & MacAfee Antivirus 1 year included.Audio: Loud enoughSSD: Intel Optane 500 GB SSDMSI will be slightly expensive but a better choice.
5,Good looks. Good response time
3,"Using it for day to work mainly MS Excel, Word, Email etc. A couple of drawbacks I am still not sure whether the preinstalled MSO 2019 is with lifetime validity as it shows Office 365. Please clarify from manufacturer etc. In case of reloading windows OS in future how do I get the key for MSO 2019. Being silver colour the numbers etc on the keypad could be a little darker preferably backlit as the numerals are not clearly visible. The numeral keypad is not provided which is another disadvantage. In most of the laptops the delete key is placed on the extreme right on top, however in the ASUS laptop the power on/off key has been placed and very often one tends to press the on/off button instead of the delete key."
5,"You'll go around, making evaluations on multiple benchmarks. This machine will be more than you need in every way. I am done with other brands like lenovo or Dell or HP or even Acer (except nitro) after having used this machine. After 3 Months of usage, a daily crazy long working hour schedule with heavy duty design or analytics softwares running as well as overstretched browser behavior, I can say it has made my work life simple and smooth.If you're less technically sound in machines like me. Go for it, because all your nerd friends will eventually recommend this after a week of research, like mine did."
3,"Value for money laptop. Speed and other functionalities are fine. The design looks outdated with sharp edged (rather than round edged) corners. Keyboard seems very flimsy and gives a cheap computer feel.The major problem is with the placing of power off button, just adjacent to del key, with absolutely no distinction..."
4,Backlit keyboard and sd card reader missing. The processor is fast and specs are good.
4,"Product is good, but still I am not happy with the performance as it has 8 gb ram and i5 processor. Remaining things, it is looking good, handy and battery performance is good. I got it for 45k. It is workthy okay product."
5,"Excellent one,u can connect your phone to the laptop and vice versa.No other brand gives this feature for 50k.I think so."
5,Clocking speed is slow but that doesn‚Äôt make any difference. Overall a good purchase
4,nice product easy to handle and nice design little bit not more battery problem means I think battery is draining little bit faster
3,There is no bill of laptop
4,"It's really user-friendly and very handy, only fault is that there was no glass for the webcam & it's not that clear during zoom calls"
5,Great for day to day to use. I'm using this for my music production work. If you are a beginner on production then definitely go for this
3,Best for daily usage and suitable for students only issue is webcam is not upto mark otherwise all things are working well till now

5,"After searching a lot I bought this laptop, and then I upgrade it with a 128 gb Nvme m.2pci SSD and 8 gb ddr4 ram, I install windows 10 in 128gb Nvme pci m.2 SSD. Now it's superfast, os opens ready within 7 seconds after pushing power button. All programs run very fast with total 12 gb ram. Total cost to upgrade this about Rs 5100. So within 35k , you may have 12 gb ram plus 1tb and 128 gb total hdd ..I am happy with this product."
1,There's no OS. Also the product cannot be returned once you discover that you have been delivered a shell (a machine with no OS)
5,Not so fast. You'll probably need to add more RAM later that could cost you 1500 for another 4gb. Overall it's fine for the price. Design is good.
1,"I have installed windows 10 OS and installed all drivers related to mouse pad, internet but none of this is working..Really disappointed with the product"
5,The laptops is best for work and school going kids too
1,"Hanging problem, waste of hard earned money"
1,Bad experience with the item. Windows 10 is not installed... Don't buy....

5,Just go for it amazing productPros: i7 10th gen is best processor in this price rangeYou can add storage and most importantly ram is expandable upto 64gb which is freaking awsome.144hz screen is flawless.Now cons: material quality is metal but low level plastic is used with it. Battery drains even in normal usage.touchpad in not upto the mark like it works but not that much smooth.
5,"Although it's a good laptop.For gaming and everything else, it's Good and in this price it's a good deal. At Amazon it's very good deal."
4,"Well packed product was received. Got a lot of nice exchange offer.When it comes to performance, it will be difficult to find a graphics card of the RTX series in this range.having 17.3"" FHD (1920x1080), 144Hz, IPS-Level. Nice battery backup when you There is good battery backup if you are doing normal work. But if you talk about gaming, then only 1-2 hours of back up will be available after full charge. 16 ram available, upgradable to 64. You will get 512 GB of SSD, upgradable. keep in mind that there is no HDD available. comes with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti Laptop GPU, 4GB GDDR6 Up to 1410MHz Boost Clock, 55W Maximum Graphics Power with Dynamic Boost."
1,Defective product sent by Amazon. The screen is completely blank and only keyboard backlit is working.When placed an order for return the pick up exective refused to pick up with a non sensical reson saying the image he has is of a working laptop  (was showing image of the order page) and screen here is blank.If the laptop was working i wouldnt have returned it in the first place.Very bad service by Amazon.
4,"I'm using this for past 1 week without any issues. Overall product is good with smooth performance, good resolution, pre-installed MS products etc. Could have been better with backlit keyboard, finger sensor & camera cover option which is available in 15"" inch variant."
5,Super awesome laptop....runs smoothly ...valorant runs on it like fluid...just amazing
5,"Light weight,smooth to work , processing is better"
1,Worst ever product i got it... They mentioned processer is 4.2GHz in specification and when it came it was 2.42GHz ....and when replaced that same product came with 4.2GHz.And now when i am calling to return it no one is receiving call..... Even with app also i am not able to place return order it says to contact us and which again does not get connected... Really frustrated with such service
1,It says Full HD screen and they delivered with a HD Ready screen.My mistake is that I didn't search for the model no and check on hp website.
2,"Got this laptop delivered fast and was quite excited about the it but, unfortunately it started showing error from day 2. When I submitted for a replacement sellers wanted me to wait for inspection. Now just holding the unused box with me. They have not done the basic quality check before dispatch. Also the laptop was configured months ago even before purchase so I am losing warranty period. Quite disappointed with this purchase"
5,It boots up really fast. 7 seconds to be exact!And it runs all softwares with so much ease. And so fast. bindblowing!!!It's really worth for the money
4,I have been using this laptop for 3 weeks and working as expected  so far. But the inbuilt antivirus was expired and I did not get benefit of inbuilt antivirusMoreover it make so much noises
4,"Excellent product at this price, just a bit disappointed with the build quality, rest all is excellent."
5,"The warranty of the laptop has started two months earlier from the purchase date, to update this hp needs a proper bill will serial number which Amazon denied to provide, this is the only issue"
1,"HARASSMENT. It has windows 11 by default and it is not very stable. Randomly simple clicks stop working. Amazon and HP support not available at all, it just says try again later all the time. Soon return window will close."
2,Poor battery performance
1,"Laptop is not upto the mark as expected, heating problem and charging is getting over easily, camera is not good..don't buy."
4,Overall device is ok but heating heavily and response delay observed incircuit maker  I didn't know where the fault is  I think seller should mension device capabilities  mouse pad operation is mirrored when compared with dell
3,"Display quality is a turn off. Keypad looks very basic, with looseness in keys. Don't find it sturdy enough. Touchpad quality is below expectation."
5,"Light weight, easy to carry, anti glare screen, and intel iris xe graphics, overall  very good product. Worth of money."
1,Very cheap finish and material. Keyboard is poor quality and very difficult to type.
1,"Received defective piece, dont buy any laptop from this seller Apario"
5,Product is too good .but battery back too low more than 3 hours
4,Clock speed is not as mentioned in the description.There's no high performance mode.Backlit keyboard is goodOverall product is nice .
2,"There is a good enough number of people who has ordered this laptop & have been using it, without knowing that it's a different laptop.The laptop you get in the box is a DELL VOSTRO 14/ 3000 WHILE THE LISTING IS OF DELL VOSTRO 14/ 3400.POINTS TO BE NOTED:1. The box & the owners manual that I have received are of 3400 while the laptop itself is a 3000.2. I thought maybe 3400 is a 3000 series laptop however after some research, realised that 3400 is a better laptop.3. 3400 has a USB Type-C & has IRIS XE as compared to the old Integrated UHD.Be very alert while buying laptops online, you never know what you r about to get.I exchanged my laptop & now waiting for refund since past three days. Just a sheer waste of time n effort. DISAPPOINTED"
2,It's been 2 days only. This laptop has heating issues. Within 5 minutes only it started heating. Keypad also started heating. & Battery backup is worst. Like within 10 minutes it's regrading by 15 to 20%
1,I am unable to keep hand on laptop to type as it has heating issue. I never face such problems in other laptop till yet. Its really uncomfortable to type due to its heating issue
3,"AMAZON IS SELLING DEFECTIVE ITEMS.At the offer time I bought Dell Vostro 3400 14"" laptop. That has some display issue. So I asked for replacement. I received new laptop after 3 days.  There was free Windows 11 upgrade option, During the upgradation time I received Blue screen due to some memory issue.NEED TO RETHINK ABOUT THE QUALITY OF PRODUCT AMAZON IS SELLING."
1,Battery backup less then 1 hour. Totally sucks
3,OVERALL GOD BUT TYPE C IS NOT AVAILABE WHICH IS SHOWN IN PICTURE
5,"Its been 2 months usage, haven't seen any negative in it.what i feel is worth my money 59,541 with i5 10th gen processor, 8gb ram, 256gb+1tb HDD, inbuilt IRIS graphics. As other brands not offering extending your RAM, this has 2 dedicated slots for ram (ram can be removed, not soldered) where you can have another 8gb ram as well.Also i see youtubers are promoting worstly now days like laptops can be used by youtubers(for editing), students and gamers. Dont know whey they discuss on narow bezzle, laptops not eating display size from years ago.Dont think with dell will get omlet with that heat. Charge if laptop not in use and dont use lap for movies and games when in charge. so that you may get better battery backup also.Finally i can say its best buy, rich look, sounds good, performance good, display is good, Cam is ok as expected and as required.regarding price, during duserra this price is 62,XXX/- with offers you can get for 60k. what's the point in  doing business. all i understood is Business = Lie."
5,"Got the laptop at a fairly good deal and for the moment, it's a great laptop. The build quality is great and something that we've come to love and appreciate from Dell. Comes with an i5 11th gen processor so it's very prompt. Battery backup is good. 64 bit with 8GB ram and 1TB storage. It's a non touch screen display. Very good value for money."
5,I purchased it for my son. He is satisfied.
5,Good battery life lasts upto 6 hours. And also it's light weight. Packaging was very good. Also having Backlit.
4,"The laptop is overall great. At first the laptop had freezing issue, either during booting or after lock screen it used to freeze 6/10 times. Then tried a few tricks -1. Manually update the BIOS.2. Reduce the startup services to only the required ones using msconfig.3. Turn off windows drive encryption (OS drive).After doing these changes, the laptop started running smoothly. Added another 8gb ddr4 ram to top it off.For me these changes worked, if someone is facing the same issues, then can try these steps."
5,"Product is good but some damage in that , hitting effect in that and mouse pad not work properly . I two time report this to customer care but they not respond me yet . This is not good . They break customer's trust..."
3,As mentioned in the configuration the processor speed is 4.2 GHZ  but I got was 2.4 GHZ Which is not fair
5,Only power button light is not available
1,In the order it was mentioned that Microsoft office will be provided. But i found that it is only for 1 month and after that i require activation code which apparently has not been provided.Also laptop gets heated within 5 minutes of working. I guess i3 is better.
5,"Have been using since a week. Nice product. Using for programming,  excellent performance"
1,"Product claims to be having a Backit, but NO, it is NOT AVAILABLE.  HEATING ISSUE.RETURN ISSUES WITH AMAZON as well. Think 10 times before buying"
1,reopened laptop received while i had placed an order for new one as well as charger was missing
1,This Laptop is not working now thats way we required support help from your side...
1,Dell assist support software is downing hardware issue in this laptop.
1,Battery backup not good.. battery life only 2hours
5,It is almost fine
5,the Product is Amazing
4,Best value for money
3,Over heat üî•issues. Battery draining
1,Battery drain and power on issue
4,"Nice product, undamaged"
1,Waste of money
4,"I bought this product in this Festive offer for the best price for just 80k.Latest intel i7 with latest graphics and best in class SSD and RAM, just in my budget.I bought this Laptop with a different view not for just gaming but for running design softwares as well, and it does the job rightly.It really is a performance laptop for the price that it is offered.Good battery backup for normal media consumption usages, if overused it might get heated up but it is normal for a gaming laptop.Missing front camera in this generation is a major drawback but our phone can be used as camera by connecting to this laptop.It does the needed job very easily and good"
5,"Bought this mainly for my trading and music production. Got for 83k which is a fair price, anything above it is notPros1. Processor is a single core beast, good for audio production and video editing but maybe not for very high end gaming and 3d animation since only quad core.2. Overall screen is good with good viewing angles and 144Hz refresh rate3. Very portable for a gaming laptop. 180W charger is slim and light.4. 7 hrs + battery on normal usageCons1. Very average speakers. My old MacBook air being smaller had much better speakers.2. Screen feels washed out but got used to in 1-2 weeks.3. Brightness is on the lower side for outdoor usage.4. Multi-core score is low because processor only quad core. AMD model has 8 coresThis laptop isn't an out and out gaming laptop and neither is it an ultrabook. But it fits my needs very well so please be clear about what you'll use it for."
5,"Best one go for it..Quick fast worth penny on this laptop.I7 11 gen 512 ssd totally worth buying itI bought this product in this Festive offer for the best price for just 80k.Latest intel i7 with latest graphics and best in class SSD and RAM, just in my budget.I bought this Laptop with a different view not for just gaming but for running design softwares as well, and it does the job rightly.It really is a performance laptop for the price that it is offered.Good battery backup for normal media consumption usages, if overused it might get heated up but it is normal for a gaming laptop.Missing front camera in this generation is a major drawback but our phone can be used as camera by connecting to this laptop.It does the needed job very easily and good"
5,Good gaming laptop. Quality tuff as it's name.No camera only defect.
5,Great buy
4,"I bought this laptop üíª  from dell store near me,Pros:*11th gen i5 with iris graphics.*256gb ssd along with 1tb HDD, 8gb ram*boots very fast andCons:*plastic build*Not suitable for heavy gaming*Charging"
1,Never expect this type of  product from dellOnly 8 days after receiving the product. Laptop is getting hanged and not starting now. The replacement date is gone yesterday.  Though I was getting same configuration from differnet brand at lower price. I went ahead and purchsed with trust from Dell.No option is there to put 0 star else i could have gave 0 star.
4,Got it in good condition and after using a week i can say its good... All things working fine... Battery life if around 4 hours with WiFi connected... I'll review this again if anything bothers me... So for now a deal for 55k is good
5,"The laptop is good. Using it for almost a month, it's little bit heavy but that is what the Dell Inspiron 15 series is known for.The battery life is good.. last for almost 6 hours. The screen is of 15"" and full hd quality.With SSD C:, the boot time is very less and it instantly boots up."
4,"It does not come with backlit keyboard as found in some of the answers. It is a decent laptop, but has some heating issues. I added a laptop fan beneath and the heating is not an issue anymore. Boot is pretty fast.This a VFM laptop from dell."
4,"Pros: Reasonable at this price rangeEasy installation,Online Dell and Microsoft support,Good speed and enough memory.Great screen resolution,Adjustable light sensitivity,Cons: A bit heavy,The battery lasts only 3,1/2hours and charges slowly.Updates keep pooping almost every day."
1,"Though the manufacturer was mentioned to be in India but when the product arrived, it mentions that it is made in China. I bought this product as I wanted to buy Made in India product but they are misleading people by mentioning manufacturer based India"
1,If I could give 0 stars I would. Worst product. Motherboard stopped working in a month. They replaced it and in just 10 days another issue started. It shows Bios error and laptop does not start.DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARN MONEY ON THIS MEDIOCRE PRODUCT.
4,The battery backup is not even 50% of what's mentioned in the description. charging time adapter overheating ...
1,The laptont seller and Amazon together are doing a fraudd taking money abd delivering sone junk crap abd using our money intrest free for weeks
1,Heating to much because of vents covered by led panel. Hest accumulated due to the vents covered by lid. Poor heat management. And poor and irresponsible service from dell. Laptop crashed two times.
1,"When type @, it shows different key. Not just one key but most of the keys are like that."
5,I like the built quality it is best and after the 11 upgrade it will give a good competition to Mac book
3,No doubt the laptop is good but the budget is too high. You can buy other brand like HP or Asus with many more features with 8 GB ram. While this gives u only 4 GB ram in 54k. Not worth pay. It doesn't even have backlit! If you a heavy software user I suggest you to go for other brand.
4,Not experienced much because it is too early to say anything within 1 month of buying a Laptop. Was expecting  laptop sound to be more but will wait more time when will be used extensively.
5,"After using for 2 weeks.. Completely dissatisfied with the product.. Refurbished laptops are better than this dell model.. Problem with trackpad. Audio settings, always hanging... etc.. etc.. Don't buy this product.. Worst model"
3,My laptop caps lock light is always on trying to reach the customer care not responding and issue is still not sort it out.I have no idea that wheather caps lock on are off every time wen i type a password its confusing me
4,Camera quality is poor.
4,Good
4,"It is faster and more responsive than any other laptop I have worked on.Why 4 stars? Because when I started using it, it killed my WiFi Router every time I tried to connect to the internet. All the devices connected to that router would loose internet connection if I connected this laptop.Extensive research on the internet revealed that the Windows based pre-installed Lenovo apps like Lenovo Vantage may be responsible for the issue.I uninstalled all pre-installed Lenovo apps and the issue is now resolved. Posting this in the hope that it may help others."
5,"This is a laptop that I purchased after extensive research and hundreds of hours of watching YT reviews on the latest laptops. I wanted something that was future proof for at least the next 7 years but light on my pocket.I did not want fancy good looking thin and light laptops with fancy features like windows hello face recognition, 24-hour battery life, Thunderbolt 4. These are good features to have but I did not want them on my laptop. The main purpose of this laptop was school work, light programming, consuming entertainment and seamless web browsing. Particularly, I wanted the office applications to open quickly and get work done soon, instead of waiting for them to load forever.This laptop delivered everything I wanted. It is a no-nonsense laptop. Performs exactly as I expected. The application opening is snappy. The response times for web browsing are super crisp. Installations take barely any time. The web download and upload speeds are impressive. Some pros and cons for your consideration below.Pros:-Built like a tank, sturdy, no flex on screen, the body is hard with minimal keyboard flex-Typing experience is good with good keys layout, awesome special keys at the top row-Trackpad is large enough and very responsive, buttery smooth pinch-zoom just like a mac-Screen is large with barely any bezels (just about 1 cm chin)-The top lid is metal and feels premium (attracts fingerprints though)-Processor and ram performance are on point-The wifi connection stability is consistent and has high speed-Applications open swiftly and boot time is within 7 seconds-Fingerprint sensor has <1 second response time (the best I have seen)-Hinge is plastic but sturdy and it will last long-Screen brightness is good, suited for my purpose-Seamless integration into a wireless display-Lenovo vantage software keeps things updated and allows easy management of the laptop-MS office setup was easy-McAfee Full version cost just 299 extra-Type C USB port for display or power deliveryCons-Webcam is poor (you may want to use an external camera, no windows hello face recognition)-Screen resolution could have been better-Sound is loud but has a tin like quality as if coming from a hollow. The sound is sufficient for casual use/online class but you may want to use a earphone anyways-Slightly heavier (can lift with one hand), probably due to the build quality-Botton cover is plastic (but a high-quality one with no plasticky feeling), feels rubberised surface-No dedicated GPU like MX450 in this model (other variations of this laptop have GPU but they do not have 16GB ram)-Battery lasts for 7 hours or less on regular surfing (a 70Whr battery would have been nicer instead of the 57 Whr)-Charger is small but the conventional type. Instead, I would have liked a single brick USB type C charger (like the mac).Final recommendation: This is the laptop for everyday use for everyone, where you don't have to worry about being careful with it (like a mac). It will take care of you. The Cons mentioned above are minor quibbles from a perfectionist but to be balanced in my review I had to point them out.Get work done without the distraction of fancy features. Will recommend this laptop for price-conscious power users who just want some peace of mind with their laptop and work. Get the three years warranty for extra peace."
4,"I have purchased it for 77K. Specifications are good like 512GB SSD,16 GB RAM,8GB graphics card, i7 11th generation laptop under this price is good. Power backup is good for 7 hours ofdaily use not for gamers. This is the review of 3 months of use.I haven't get any WiFi connectivity issues for first 3 weeks later WiFi connectivity issues are started.Freuently disconnecting the WiFi. Also frequently refreshing the browser and desktop. System is getting restarted frequently,so I have reset the OS after that it is working as expected so rating has icreased from 3 to 4. Speakers are working fine, sound quality is fabulous.Display is also good.I will strongly recommend this laptop for every one including gamers.I will edit this review frequently to help others."
3,"Guys they said office 2019 is available and pre installed. I found it that 365 trial version is installed and it ask for paid activation as per MS policy. There is complete mismatch. I tried to call lenovo care they asked me uninstall this 365 trial and gave some link to download the 2019 office. I did that and created new MS email account but still it is not activating.Laptop is good ..some missing things that the mouse has only one set of right and left key, it is fast and booting also quickly.PS worked with Lenovo premium support and raised rickets now office activated. Got Win 11"
4,"The overall laptop is good and working smoothPros:The fingerprint sensor is awesomeBattery backup is as decent, While doing development on vscode I found it near where 5-6 hours.screen brightness is good and keyboard backlit comes with 2 mode of lightsSlim easy to carryPerfomance is excellent no lag so farDoing development on vs code working on multiple tabs and also other software are running parralelyCons:Charger gets heated after 1 hourKeyboard is little conjusted as it is 15inch laptop and not 15.6 inchCamera quality is not up to the markbody is ok okIf u want to take laptop for professional use u can definitely go for it.This is the best choice"
5,"Performance is good for office and personal usage.However Hard-disk space is just 512GB.I used multiple Virtual Machines, and that was smooth.Games with very high graphics requirements has significant lag. I tried to play Call of Duty, but it was not as smooth as expected."
5,"Feature loaded for Business Purpose. Used for a week now and all laptop system is fine till date. Activation of MS office was also smooth. Getting use to new keyboard will take some time. I feel Window Pro option, should also be available, even if Lenovo might charge a small premium for the same. Laptop boots really fast due to SSD and all applications opens promptly as compared to my old dell i7 laptop. New laptop means good battery life, but need to see how it performs after couple of years of use."
4,"Namaste, dear Sir/Ma‚ÄôamI have happily purchased a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 Laptop from you. Unfortunately after transferring the data from an old laptop, i found that the capacity of storage on this laptop is 512GB SSD only and excluding the expected 1TB HDD.512 GB SSD is not enough of a storage capacity for my use.Also, Initially I was looking for i7 Processor and this Laptop is i5.Therefore, if possible, I would like to exchange with another laptop that you offer and, of course, pay for the difference in price.The Laptop and Specs i look for are:CPU - i7 ProcessorStorage - 1TB HDD + 500 GB SSDRAM - 16GBSize - 15.6‚ÄùKind regards and  thanks you for your help."
5,It is fast and works perfectly fine.Little bit heavy to my liking though.
5,"Sharing views after 1 week of laptop usage.Pros:1. Intel i5/16 GB RAM with shared IRIS graphics in just Rs. 60k.2. Privacy shutter for cam.3. Sturdy body with good elevation for ventilation.4. Full access to MS Office 2019 home/student edition and free upgrade to Windows 11.5. No bloatware that slowdown PC.6. Lenovo Vantage point to control some BIOS features from Windows.Cons:1. Only 2 USBs ports, as I am used to having 3 USB ports in my old Dell laptop.2. Screen brightness control is very limited. Either it is too bright or too dark and not getting proper setting."
2,It took me one month to get my laptop working to my requirement.. the laptop comes with only student n home MS office so outlook and other apps needed for business is to be bought and it is expensive.. secondly not many Lenovo shops to help configure the laptop everyone in and around services out of warranty laptops only.. it's a huge draw back.. I wish u had choosen Dell instead..
2,"You can buy the same for better price directly in lenovo site than here. Was mentioned as Limited time deal but later realised the price is cheaper in Lenovo site and Tatacliq.In Lenovo the 2021 model of same specification is much cheaper.With 1mp camera, the video quality is very poor. Didn't expect such thing from Amazon where mentioned as Limited Time Deal and price is still comparatively higher."
5,"Got this power-packed laptop with i7-11th Gen under the hood. 16 GB RAM and SSD has really added to the performance. Would definitely recommend to anyone whose a developer, business person, student or someone whose just looking to have a smooth day to day experience working on a laptop."
1,"WiFi connectivity issues are started.Frequently disconnecting the WiFi. Also frequently refreshing the browser and desktop. Unable to upgrade to win11 because of wifi connection. Tried the mentioned solution steps (restarted router, rested the pc, updated the drivers) in lenovo page for thus issue still no luck. Not at all worth buying this laptop.Seeking for help from amazon technician no one has turned up for this."
5,"Nice product,Best Performance Laptop Even tested The graphics is awesome and ssd is there so no issues in Speed.Loving ittttttt.."
4,This product is good build quality and looks premium. I have purchased 16gb RAM and 512 gb SSD (device has 475GB only not 512GB) in that free storage is ~440GB . But sometimes perfomance is getting slow in normal usage only. Sound quality and display good.
5,light for office use and fast for gaming ideal laptop.
5,i love the laptop and the perfomance it does is just awesome and another interestihing is it has windows 11 for free and just looking great the intel i5 processor does the job for you just forget the negative comments and go for it  only one thing it does not have face unlock may be for this price range tthis is little minus point
5,This laptop was amazing and good performance and good battery backup overall performance was good..Recommended to students price range between 70k-80k
4,There might be a problem with the screen or the driver. All of a sudden the text on the screen starts to shake. This has happened twice now. Also the screen goes black some times when the popped up window in Edge takes time to load.
2,Overall Product... upgraded windows 11 and faced flickering issues and resolved by Levono
1,"In the description and with the model, finger print reader included. While setting up, it says no biometric hardware found. Please suggest."
4,overall its good laptop.Its little heavy but good laptop.
5,This product justifies its value. I am using it for development purpose and performance is really good.

5,Not up to the mark
5,Great product.
5,Nice one
4,"It is faster and more responsive than any other laptop I have worked on.Why 4 stars? Because when I started using it, it killed my WiFi Router every time I tried to connect to the internet. All the devices connected to that router would loose internet connection if I connected this laptop.Extensive research on the internet revealed that the Windows based pre-installed Lenovo apps like Lenovo Vantage may be responsible for the issue.I uninstalled all pre-installed Lenovo apps and the issue is now resolved. Posting this in the hope that it may help others."
5,"This is a laptop that I purchased after extensive research and hundreds of hours of watching YT reviews on the latest laptops. I wanted something that was future proof for at least the next 7 years but light on my pocket.I did not want fancy good looking thin and light laptops with fancy features like windows hello face recognition, 24-hour battery life, Thunderbolt 4. These are good features to have but I did not want them on my laptop. The main purpose of this laptop was school work, light programming, consuming entertainment and seamless web browsing. Particularly, I wanted the office applications to open quickly and get work done soon, instead of waiting for them to load forever.This laptop delivered everything I wanted. It is a no-nonsense laptop. Performs exactly as I expected. The application opening is snappy. The response times for web browsing are super crisp. Installations take barely any time. The web download and upload speeds are impressive. Some pros and cons for your consideration below.Pros:-Built like a tank, sturdy, no flex on screen, the body is hard with minimal keyboard flex-Typing experience is good with good keys layout, awesome special keys at the top row-Trackpad is large enough and very responsive, buttery smooth pinch-zoom just like a mac-Screen is large with barely any bezels (just about 1 cm chin)-The top lid is metal and feels premium (attracts fingerprints though)-Processor and ram performance are on point-The wifi connection stability is consistent and has high speed-Applications open swiftly and boot time is within 7 seconds-Fingerprint sensor has <1 second response time (the best I have seen)-Hinge is plastic but sturdy and it will last long-Screen brightness is good, suited for my purpose-Seamless integration into a wireless display-Lenovo vantage software keeps things updated and allows easy management of the laptop-MS office setup was easy-McAfee Full version cost just 299 extra-Type C USB port for display or power deliveryCons-Webcam is poor (you may want to use an external camera, no windows hello face recognition)-Screen resolution could have been better-Sound is loud but has a tin like quality as if coming from a hollow. The sound is sufficient for casual use/online class but you may want to use a earphone anyways-Slightly heavier (can lift with one hand), probably due to the build quality-Botton cover is plastic (but a high-quality one with no plasticky feeling), feels rubberised surface-No dedicated GPU like MX450 in this model (other variations of this laptop have GPU but they do not have 16GB ram)-Battery lasts for 7 hours or less on regular surfing (a 70Whr battery would have been nicer instead of the 57 Whr)-Charger is small but the conventional type. Instead, I would have liked a single brick USB type C charger (like the mac).Final recommendation: This is the laptop for everyday use for everyone, where you don't have to worry about being careful with it (like a mac). It will take care of you. The Cons mentioned above are minor quibbles from a perfectionist but to be balanced in my review I had to point them out.Get work done without the distraction of fancy features. Will recommend this laptop for price-conscious power users who just want some peace of mind with their laptop and work. Get the three years warranty for extra peace."
4,"I have purchased it for 77K. Specifications are good like 512GB SSD,16 GB RAM,8GB graphics card, i7 11th generation laptop under this price is good. Power backup is good for 7 hours ofdaily use not for gamers. This is the review of 3 months of use.I haven't get any WiFi connectivity issues for first 3 weeks later WiFi connectivity issues are started.Freuently disconnecting the WiFi. Also frequently refreshing the browser and desktop. System is getting restarted frequently,so I have reset the OS after that it is working as expected so rating has icreased from 3 to 4. Speakers are working fine, sound quality is fabulous.Display is also good.I will strongly recommend this laptop for every one including gamers.I will edit this review frequently to help others."
3,"Guys they said office 2019 is available and pre installed. I found it that 365 trial version is installed and it ask for paid activation as per MS policy. There is complete mismatch. I tried to call lenovo care they asked me uninstall this 365 trial and gave some link to download the 2019 office. I did that and created new MS email account but still it is not activating.Laptop is good ..some missing things that the mouse has only one set of right and left key, it is fast and booting also quickly.PS worked with Lenovo premium support and raised rickets now office activated. Got Win 11"
4,"The overall laptop is good and working smoothPros:The fingerprint sensor is awesomeBattery backup is as decent, While doing development on vscode I found it near where 5-6 hours.screen brightness is good and keyboard backlit comes with 2 mode of lightsSlim easy to carryPerfomance is excellent no lag so farDoing development on vs code working on multiple tabs and also other software are running parralelyCons:Charger gets heated after 1 hourKeyboard is little conjusted as it is 15inch laptop and not 15.6 inchCamera quality is not up to the markbody is ok okIf u want to take laptop for professional use u can definitely go for it.This is the best choice"
5,"Performance is good for office and personal usage.However Hard-disk space is just 512GB.I used multiple Virtual Machines, and that was smooth.Games with very high graphics requirements has significant lag. I tried to play Call of Duty, but it was not as smooth as expected."
5,"Feature loaded for Business Purpose. Used for a week now and all laptop system is fine till date. Activation of MS office was also smooth. Getting use to new keyboard will take some time. I feel Window Pro option, should also be available, even if Lenovo might charge a small premium for the same. Laptop boots really fast due to SSD and all applications opens promptly as compared to my old dell i7 laptop. New laptop means good battery life, but need to see how it performs after couple of years of use."
4,"Namaste, dear Sir/Ma‚ÄôamI have happily purchased a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 Laptop from you. Unfortunately after transferring the data from an old laptop, i found that the capacity of storage on this laptop is 512GB SSD only and excluding the expected 1TB HDD.512 GB SSD is not enough of a storage capacity for my use.Also, Initially I was looking for i7 Processor and this Laptop is i5.Therefore, if possible, I would like to exchange with another laptop that you offer and, of course, pay for the difference in price.The Laptop and Specs i look for are:CPU - i7 ProcessorStorage - 1TB HDD + 500 GB SSDRAM - 16GBSize - 15.6‚ÄùKind regards and  thanks you for your help."
5,It is fast and works perfectly fine.Little bit heavy to my liking though.
5,"Sharing views after 1 week of laptop usage.Pros:1. Intel i5/16 GB RAM with shared IRIS graphics in just Rs. 60k.2. Privacy shutter for cam.3. Sturdy body with good elevation for ventilation.4. Full access to MS Office 2019 home/student edition and free upgrade to Windows 11.5. No bloatware that slowdown PC.6. Lenovo Vantage point to control some BIOS features from Windows.Cons:1. Only 2 USBs ports, as I am used to having 3 USB ports in my old Dell laptop.2. Screen brightness control is very limited. Either it is too bright or too dark and not getting proper setting."
2,It took me one month to get my laptop working to my requirement.. the laptop comes with only student n home MS office so outlook and other apps needed for business is to be bought and it is expensive.. secondly not many Lenovo shops to help configure the laptop everyone in and around services out of warranty laptops only.. it's a huge draw back.. I wish u had choosen Dell instead..
2,"You can buy the same for better price directly in lenovo site than here. Was mentioned as Limited time deal but later realised the price is cheaper in Lenovo site and Tatacliq.In Lenovo the 2021 model of same specification is much cheaper.With 1mp camera, the video quality is very poor. Didn't expect such thing from Amazon where mentioned as Limited Time Deal and price is still comparatively higher."
5,"Got this power-packed laptop with i7-11th Gen under the hood. 16 GB RAM and SSD has really added to the performance. Would definitely recommend to anyone whose a developer, business person, student or someone whose just looking to have a smooth day to day experience working on a laptop."
1,"WiFi connectivity issues are started.Frequently disconnecting the WiFi. Also frequently refreshing the browser and desktop. Unable to upgrade to win11 because of wifi connection. Tried the mentioned solution steps (restarted router, rested the pc, updated the drivers) in lenovo page for thus issue still no luck. Not at all worth buying this laptop.Seeking for help from amazon technician no one has turned up for this."

1,Reveiw after 10 days :Worst Don't buy these kind of productsBattery life 1hrHanging for every 1 secBooting time 10 mntsHeating = You can cook anythingFinally Worst.. Worst... Worst...This reveiw is from IT employee (ME) in INFOSYS BPM LMT Banglore..If you still want to buy... Sure you can...
1,"This is externally poor product, looks like mot of the review online are fake. This system takes lot of time to reboot. Even the computers with 1GB RAM is faster than this. Application doesn't open within 30 seconds, many a times application becomes unresponsive for a minute before opening.In the same configuration other vendors laptop are much cheaper, still bought this for brand Name - its not worth.All review online with system reboots in 10 - 15 seconds are fake.Color display is horrible, doesn't matter how fast your internet is none of the streaming apps works and its not internet speed issue since it works on Web browser.It doesn't have as good battery life as advertise."
1,"Worse laptop ever ,sound n video quality is good for zoom class ,but the system always keeping on hanging jad to call sopport ,have no proper response as well ,not able to open 2 windows as it's always been gating hanged so frustrating this laptop is ,please go for dell I have brought a dell 5 years back still working amazingly, unfortunately I had left that at home brought this hp product to do my work .worse experience ever ."
1,This laptop has 4GB RAM. But Microsoft teams needs 4GB RAM over and above system requirements.So this laptop cannot handle teams and will freeze making the laptop unusable.Do not buy this laptop if you intend to use MS teams.This review is written after 7 days of constant use and lots of troubleshooting with HP experts to resolve the laptop freezing issue.
2,"Not saying it's completely waste, i trust hp for laptops from years, as i have 2 already at home. But particularly this model performance is below par considering the specifications, should've gone for Intel processor rather than amd. *lags too much, high end softwares like autocad, sketch, coral draw, photoshop isn't compatible or recommended for this variant, it sucks!*The only solution for lagging on this model is, you've to insert atleast 240GB SSD for smooth experience which cost around 3500/-"
1,Got this laptop yesterday and used for 1 day. Its total waste of money. Its cpu is so low such that even if you open a chrome its showing 100% usage. Bought it for my kids online class but google meet is hanging completely if you open video. You need to power off the laptop to get out of meeting.  Its too low only fit for MS word or note pad activity.I called every customer care to check whether its possible to upgrade but none helping.Total waste of money never buy it.
1,I bought this product from this site and had very very bad experience it works sooo slow i bought this for office work and didnt even use to for single day i went to service centre near my loc and they advice me to install something for better performance amd they said now a days these laptops are lacking speed and the only solution is to install what they r suggesting which will coast extra 6500pluse GST seriously what dont you guys just include that 6500 in mrp so customer would be aware of total charges cant explain how bad it was i didnt get any help yet üòû
5,"Nothing to dislike in this price range, I bought it for content writing and seo article writing. Though Microsoft 365 is in trial version but I simply have a way around it. However I would suggest you guys to use hp and macfee collaborated security. Overall I am loving it let's see how long it sustains."
3,"Just OK product for daily basic functions like browsing, Spread sheet and Word editing.Comes with a Windows 10.Doesn't include MS office.Good resolution.Battery backup for 4 hr max (if you are playing music and videos)"
3,"Good when u open few apps and for rugged use by children for online classes , crashes sometimes when used for video classes of google class or else good for normal user to do his activities and watch videos"
3,"This laptop is best in it's price range :) But DON'T buy this laptop for gaming purpose . It is only good for normal day to day uses like surfing, photo editing, etc.‚úÖAlthough Battery backup is awesome. It charges quickly!‚úÖDisplay is average *‚úÖThis is not a light weight laptop ^‚úÖProcessing speed is SLOW* also sometimes it hangs too.‚úÖAllover I am happy with this laptop cause I do normal work (I don't play games üòÖ )& I recommend you to buy this if your budget is under 25000‚Çπ"
1,Very slow and crashing a lot. I pushed this mainly for my daughter's online  classes. Any video calling app makes the laptop to crash after 20 mins. My daughter not able to attend classes properly with this. With no app running Ram usage is 80%. Never buy this for kids online classes
1,Out of the box and found out that this ones horribly slow. Take way too long to open simple chrome browser. Waste of money
1,"Why this product is available on Amazon, if it is faulty. Too many people already complained about it. I purchased on the name of brand but I was wrong this product should be immediately removed from Amazon. This product is too slow to do anything on it. No one wants to take laptop sit for hours just to visit a website or for any nominal task.It keeps on hanging, not responds to commands. Don't buy."
1,discovered a defected software within the first 5hrs of use which the hp guys can't even fix and they won't let you return. Don't buy this product unless you want to donate your cash. The hp team will be brutal when you contact them. Wish i could give them a 0 star rating.
1,"My son cannot attend school sessions which happens on microsoft team.The product hangs only with teams running with no other applications. I have optimized all startup programs, settings on microsoft teams (h/w acceleration, animation off etc). But teams sucks the processor and RAM.Hence this product doesnt serve the purpose, if you are going to use microsoft teams."
1,Picture display not good no HD not satisfied worst laptop plz don‚Äôt waste your money on thos laptop very low processor picture quality worst old version super flop.. It take 1 hour for starting
1,"Please check before buying...I am not happy with the service of hp.its look like a toy....sorry toys are better then this .....very slow ...I am giving 3 marks out of 10......you can use this laptop only for Facebook,email,movies only......for.other work you need other laptop for office work ......say no to online ....no one can listen you.Waste of money ......"
2,"I purchased this Product after reading many Reviews, expecting a good product. But when I received the product, look was the only thing that attracted me.It's too slow. Only a word or an excel file takes 4 minutes to open. Can not even work for normal office things."
1,The system crashes every time during use.  I want to return this product.  1st time facing such bad service issue from Amazon.  Its says before returning technician will come. Since last 2days they are supposed to come..no one is calling or coming.  I want to return this laptop. Its really defective.
1,Even pentium IV processors worked very fast compared to this processor. The worst laptop i have ever seen. AMD is a garbage. The whole windows 10 freezes after an hour. Remove windows 10 and use linux for gods sake. Seriously!!! 24k is wasted.
1,"This is a junk product by HP , the performance is extremely poor and I use it only for internet surfing . The laptop constantly freezes , i can understand if this was on one laptop . I have 8 and all 8 demonstrate the same performance issue  . Moreover , one of the laptop does boot after just 4 weeks . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
2,"The product is little slow, and Microsoft 365 not included. If you want to buy this than you have to also buy the Microsoft office apart from this . I‚Äôm using this last three days it is too slow if you have open three or more programs then you have to wait for some minute because it is going hang."
5,"This laptop is being used primarily for online classes/tuition and for checking emails, viewing Youtube videos, internet surfing for which is more than meets the purpose. Additionally, MS Office usage is also without any issues or delays. As an entry level laptop, it meets all my expectations."
5,Best compared to price.Its slick and light weight. Working smooth since last 1 month. It does lag a bit if you download heavy apps but its acceptable with this price range.
1,"Recently I bought this product,finding that it is a bestseller laptop...but starting from the first day it is so slow..it has been 30 minutes since I am trying to check my Gmail but not able to do so.worst product"
1,Firstly thhis lap top was delivered in the night which is unusual. Secondly  the speed is slow and gets hanged frequently.  I strongly suspect the system has been opened and some wrong  doing  has happened . The performance is very very POOR.  Gaming? What a joke... cannot run teams continuously for 10.mins!
1,Poor performance.. Do not buy this item.. Gets hang every time... just bought the new laptop and even online classes are no possible on the laptop.
5,"Exceeded expectations. Nice glossy finish, numeric keypad, good battery life and on time Amazon delivery. Light weight too."
1,This laptop is damn slow. It uses üíØ% of CPU and Memory when open any software which make other programs to stop working abruptly. Waste of money. The HP support is very bad. No support is provided for the same.
3,"I had purchased this product in comparison with similar product and 1 year onsite warranty and this product  as per description 3 year onsite warranty. Today I realized after almost 7 to 8 days followups and calls with amazon customer service that this is NOT lenovo warranty this is onsite go warranty. This has completely mislead me thinking that online purchase experience is still so naive after all AI, Big Data technologies advancement. I feel I am in 1998."

5,Excellent product we like it. SO far So gud.
5,Best laptop ever in this rangeVery fast speed Amazing
5,Light weight
4,overall performance is good
1,Volume of laptop is too low. Called customer care to replace but they were unable to understand the problem. They are trusting only servify app not customer. After paying 75000 rs if you get things like this is not acceptable. Better to purchase in shops rather than in online stores. Waste of money and time.
4,"Battery life is 4:30hr I played games and videos and web browse.For best gaming not recommendable but can play games, if there graphic card for 2gb then its very good.Regular working Performance is very good.Speaker sounding is good.Fast changing within appx. 1hr 15min full charge.Display is good."

4,Excellent laptop for the price. Doesn't have backlit keyboard as mentioned in the description.  It's misleading..... the answers given to the questions are conflicting....Amazon should ensure correct description is given
4,"Light weight,nice design but has no cd drive and also doesn't come with a bag.Also there is no licensed ms-office given in this laptop"
5,"Value product , good features"
5,"UPDATE:So Amazon has updated the invoice with serial number in it and given it to me via email.FULL REVIEW as I promised:1) Build, looks, hardware:Sturdy build, minimal flex, looks great(subjective), hinge goes 180 and feels sturdy.Keyboard is nice to type, has two levels of brightness. Touchpad is good, uses windows precision drivers. No creaky noises from the chassis, 4 cooling vents.Fan noise minimal even at load. Privacy shutter for camera. 4 Usb 3.2 gen 1 ports and has all the ports you need (except sd card slot). Charging brick is of 170watts, charging is super fast(have to turn on rapid charge in lenovo vantage, 80% in one hour). Speakers are decent, can be tuned via dolby software.2) Display:120Hz BOE NV156FHM-NX1.45% NTSC, 63% Srgb, 250 Nits brightness, response rate 14.9ms.Looks just like any other 45% ntsc display out there, brightness more than enough for indoor use, looks fluid due to 120hz, my amateur eyes didn't notice any ghosting. Increase saturation in amd radeon software to make it look better, try calibrating too.I can't lower refresh rate to 60Hz, no such option. Maybe have to use custom software.3) Storage and RAM-SSD: SAMSUNG MZVLB256HBHQ-000L2.Great SSD. Read speeds of 3500MBPS and write speeds of 2500MBPS. Best I've seen so far in a laptop in this range.Has a 2nd SSD slot but have to remove harddrive to access that.HDD: WDC WD10SPZX-08Z10Standard 5400rpm hard drive, speeds upto 120MBPS read/write.RAM: Kingston 3200Mhz LV32D4S2S8HD-8. Can be upgraded upto 64 gigs based on videos online.4) Battery life-60whr battery.Updated Battery Life (70% brightness, startup apps off, better battery + balance mode, hybrid mode on, keyboard lighting level 1)8.5 -9 hours watching offline movies on VLC with airplane mode on.7-8 hours reading PDFs, making notes, little browsing, office apps.5-6 hours light usage like browsing, listening to songs, youtube, background apps open like discord, telegram etc(Do not use chrome, battery and ram eater)5-7 hours YouTube playback4 hours medium usage2-3 hours heavy usage1 hour gaming.Battery life heavily DEPENDS on what you're doing. For most people, it will be 3-5 hours.5) Gaming&Performance-Hardly any difference between 1650 and 1650ti, and this 1650 is as good as a 1650ti on other laptops as you can run your display directly via Nvidia graphics(option in lenovo vantage and BIOS) so you'll get an FPS boost in games.Not much of a gamer myself, bought this mainly for productivity but played hitman 3 at ultra, both cpu and gpu temps were around 66-67 and FPS around 50-80 so good results.  Valorant gave temps around 60 for both CPU and GPU and fps around 150. Check YT videos for gaming reviews.Cinebench R23 gave score of 8600, CPU boosts upto 57 watts(can be more?), slightly more than the competition. Temps stayed below 90 at full load.6) Linux compatibility:Works, I'm running Manjaro but out of the box touchpad isn't working and display brightness can't be lowered(fixes available for both).Great laptop overall, only issue for me is average battery life, I expected more since this has a 60whr battery and a 7nm processor but you can run this for 5+ hours doing light stuff at medium brightness and keyboard lighting off.  Medium usage will give you 3-4 hours(full brightness, keyboard lighting on).Don't expect rtx 3000 series and 1660tis below 70k, we have to settle with 1650s and 1650tis so no point waiting for 2021 laptops if your budget is limited."
5,"The laptop feels premium and the performance is smooth. Have to test some games yet. The only issue is that the brightness is on the lower side. If you're okay with that, look no further, this laptop is for you. The laptop is not the lightest out there like Zephyrus G14, but the weight is manageable considering it's a mid-level gaming laptop.I would go for this one rather than IdeaPad gaming 3 and this laptop is superior in every aspect. For example, this laptop is versatile i.e., can be used at work too as it doesn't have that vulgar gamer look with RGB and shit. Looks stealthy, elegant, and minimalistic.I will be back with a detailed review.Edit 1: Gaming - Played battlefield 1 on this machine. Getting steady 75 fps in performance mode. Surprised by the temperatures which don't go more than 65‚Å∞C even after long gaming sessions. Fan noise is not disturbing too.Edit 2: Played Far Cry 5 on my legion. The game can be run at up to the highest settings, but I opted high and getting 65 fps steadily on average. Again the GPU temperatures don't go above 62‚Å∞C. Some serious cooling!Edit 3: Back with more insight! Valorant runs at an average of 150 fps which is more than anyone can ask for. But it comes at an expense of temperatures which can go to 68 degrees which is not that bad. But still, I used the fps limiter to limit it at 85 fps resulting in cooler 58 degrees. Win-Win for all xD.Also, the speakers on this laptop are great. Great for movie watching andif you really want to, for gaming too. The keyboard is derived from Thinkpad which means it's awesome for any work you throw at it. Keystrokes are clicky and tactile with anti-ghosting enabled.Also a tip, please make a restore point on the external hard drive using macrium reflect immediately after buying. These windows updates can f#*$ up your lovely legion 5. If possible avoid them completely.Will try more recent demanding games and come back. Cheers."
5,I liked everything about this lappy feels great in hands I only faced battery issue which is common in all gaming laptops but makes this different is that super rapid pro charging which charged my lappy from 20 to 80 in 45-50 mins.. that's to kool this is best value for money lappy
5,"This lappy is awesome, at this price point truly a beast. Been using this heavily for 10 days now not cons whatsoever. My purpose is programming plus gaming and my boy this has given me everything ‚ù§ Gaming takes a lot from hardwares, so i am getting good fps an average of 45 to 60 fps on AAA title games like Rdr2, Control so on. FPS games are smooth in Valorant(170 fps) and CSGO(180 fps). 120hz display is quite vivid and speakers are amazing. Lenovo provides a lot of variety to control or tune our device with thier own Vantage software."
5,"Just bought it 3 days ago, my review is based on whatever I have observed in these 3 days. I'll keep editing this review as time passes.Gaming: As of now, I have only installed Forza Horizon 4 and Valorant on the ssd. Forza gave about 70fps on medium settings which i have locked at 60fps. Valorant gives 110-130 fps.Thermals: This laptop is excellent in the thermals department. It barely heats above 80. Even after playing forza for 2 hours cpu was only at 77. The fans are exceptionally quiet. You cant even hear its fans churning in the summer when your ceiling fan makes more noise than your laptop cracking games at performance mode üòùBattery: Reviews here are so negetive about battery but I found it to last around 6-7 hours when doing casual work. (By casual I mean running android studio, chrome and terminal together) Dont expect it to last more than 3 hrs when gaming tho. Well still, Id say battery performance is sufficient. Also it has a rapid charge option, which i havent tried yet. But the battery charges fast enough as it is.Build quality: Legion is legion. Nothing more I can say here.Storage: I wish it had 512 gb ssd. 256 gb fills up way too fast. Only 45 gb free after 3 days. Ps. YOU CAN upgrade storage without removing anything as there is another m.2 slot where you can add a ssd of upto 512 gb. üòÅCoding and video editing: If Multicore performance is what youre after, buy this laptop eyes closed. This is a beast in multicore performance. Leaves i7 11th gen in the dust. Plus 7 nm chip means much less heat. Buy this if you want an entry level workstation at this price. üòçPs: bought at 65k."
4,"Hey,so I've been using this laptop for quite a bit as of now and here are few things that I like and dislike about this laptop in no particular order.Pros:First of all this laptop is blazing fast,like bootup,app loading etc takes minimal time and SSD is amazing.Build- completely made with plastic but it's super sturdy and great quality plastic is used,it will not feel cheap. Material used near keyboard (palmrest) is damn good.ü§§Display- display is decent,I feel somewhat screen could have been a bit more brighter. 120hz is great and I think the difference between it's competitors which offer 144hz screen has no difference overall. It covers 45% NTSC color and almost every laptop(gaming) under this price range has the same so no worries. Unless you're pro photographer and color grading is your go to thing then I don't think you're looking for this laptop or you can get an additional monitor.Speakers- speakers in this laptop is good,you can watch movies without using earphones and worrying about sound quality,audio is by Harman Kardon and it offers great quality while consuming content.Keyboard- there are little things that we don't consider when we're buying a laptop, keyboard is one of them. Keyboard is greaaaaaatttt, I mean greeeaat, although I use an external keyboard but whenever I use the laptop's keyboard it just feels fab and super smooth, also key travel is nice. There's one thing that is subject to personal preference the backlight is basic not RGB, it would have been great if it had the RGB backlight keyboard BUT this normal white backlight also gives this laptop an elegant and bit more professional look.Graphics Card: it's the basic 1650 which is in every laptop coming in this price range and if you're a moderate gamer/casual gamer you should be okay with it. The graphics card is directly connected to the screen of this laptop which is a great as you can visibly get more FPS and better gameplay experience while playing. Use hydbrid mode to enhance battery backup and use the inbuilt GPU and 1650 simultaneously.Battery: Battery is better than I expected when watching movies and screen at 50%-70% it can easily survive for 5-6 hrs or maybe more. Also you should switch into hybrid mode in order to get the most out of the battery. Coming to charging,it has a massive 170W power block,and it can charge using its quick charge 2.0 which is ridiculously fast. You can tweak few settings in Lenovo's Vantage software.Performance: It's a beast,you can throw any apps and games in this can run that smoothly and R5 4600H is an amazing processor and combined with 1650 it delivers a great performance. The thermals in this system is the most amazing part in this laptop, ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§π‡•å‡§≤ ‡§π‡•à. I've been playing Farcry 3 and 4 and it runs like makkhan in high & ultra settings.I bought it for 68k and now it's priced at more than 72k.It's competitors: Asus TUF f15 (Lol it's not a competitor), Acer Nitro 5 (somehow similar), HP victus 16 (do not even consider this).Verdict: Should you buy this? If you get it for 65k go for it, buying this laptop for more than 70k is just waste of money & irrelevant."
5,"Very happy with my purchase (65k!). Been just a couple of days, no problems as of yet. No external defects, no software problems, no missing parts. Everything was perfect, from packaging to performance. Played Far Cry 4 and NFS Payback. Ran buttery smooth, easily giving around 100+ FPS on avg! CPU temp was max around 65¬∞C, and GPU usage was 95-99%.. And the Display is not at all dim, as many have mentioned. It's pretty good indoors. Best part is the built-in Lenovo Vantage app. You can do every necessary thing for your laptop's good performance via that app. And make sure to check your Warranty start date from Lenovo support website. Mine was more than a month before my actual purchase date. Just register a complain and upload your invoice and it will be updated. No issues!"
5,"The laptop performs good, good wifi,good gpu,fast ram but it has a major compromise on display, battery and camera. My 7 years old laptop had a better camera than it. The colours on the display are not that good and the battery is decent. It is a good laptop for gaming. I played valorant 215 fps at highest setting. I upgraded my ram and got a 25fps boost. Gta 5 112max, warzone stable 90 fps. Did see some shutters in the game but after updates it was solved. Overall a good gaming laptop. Must buy if u don't care bout battery üîã.Edit- after updates battery is good and the camera is improved."
5,"It's good laptop, won't say it's best, but yes definitely it's not bad. For gamers it's good to go, one important thing with this machine is like is with it's clean minimal look, doesn't looks like a bulky gaming one, matte plastic finish it's good. No laptop is perfect & no one can claim for such, because every machine will have one or other negative side with the positive, same is with this laptop as well. For professional creator's this is a good laptop to work with 68k budget range. You can upgrade the ssd n ram in future. N people are working on i5 n ryzen 3 to creation purpose so why can't one do it on this good machine.Rest everything is good.I won't b telling about the negative one's, because it's gonna be therein in every machine.Much metta to all ‚ú®"
5,"It have very premium design lookslike very professional not gaminglaptop. But BatteryNot that good getting around 3 hours on normal use(Chrome and classes)thermals are really good of this laptop,but charging speed is good(50% in 25to30 minutes ). Speaker are loud. Overall I'll rate it 4.5/5, as it lacks RGB keyboard and battery and colour accuracy."
5,"Literally, at this price its a supercar. As an IT professional, i use to implement long hours of coding  and yes also gaming.  Its buttery smooth for each and every task you perform.The build quality, it was damn good and also the heat control of this lappy is insane. I worked constantly for 7 to 8 hrs a day but still the laptop is so nuch cooler than expected. If you want a laptop at around 65 to 67k, dont go for anything else just go for it blindly. You will not disappointed."
5,"Battery life is 3.5 hrs on average. Performance wise, this is a beast. (Both processor and graphics card)I play v√†lorant at max settings and parallely I open 10 chrome tabs, 6 PDFs, and more apps running in background. Multitasking at its best.There were reviews saying brightness is not upto the mark, but it works fine for me.Speakers are fine, I'll not say great. They forgot to put some more bass in speakers. I have 2.1 speakers additionally so I prefer to use them.There are lot of ports on this laptop, more than enough.120hz is smooth. I got 160-170 fps average in v√†lorant.Keypad is very good.Thermals are excellent, it doesn't touch high temperatures and you won't feel it.Overall value for money. First I didn't have good opinion on Lenovo laptops before buying. After usage of this laptop, I recommend this to everyone whose needs are gaming, multitasking."
1,"It's not regarding the products quantity, it's about how bad is Amazon's customer service and their return policies. The product I received was defective as it shuts down randomly in middle of nowhere. So I asked for a replacement but since it was out of stock they said they would provide me a return. So I kept the product ready in its original state for return but the delivery guy use to come to the door and says that they can't take this back since it doesn't works. Moreover he added that his Station Manger asked him not to take it back. I called the customer service they assured me that they will contact the station regarding this but they did nothing. Now it's the third time he repeated the same thing. Now I'm stuck with a 68k dead laptop and no one is picking up my call."
1,I bought it on May after 1 month of normal usage.... Laptop video output reduced.... then I called lenovo support....they told to install nvidia driver.... after that display got blurred.... then I raised the complaint in lenovo support ...... Till now no response from lenovo support..... worst service from lenovo......
5,"I am the kinda guy that does not care about the battery life OR the weight of the device, not at least when you know you bought a gaming laptop. Still, it weighs around 2KG and the battery lasts for around 4-5 hrs with normal usage, which, I must say is more than enough.I would say the display could have been better with the color accuracy but this thing with a 120Hz refresh rate does a farely good job averall. You cant change the 120Hz setting to 60Hz though.About the gaming performance: it actually is very scilent and thermally perfected. Stays within 70-75 celcius mark although I havent reached 60 till now but I'm thinking this thing could reach 75-80 if you try to throttle it. Which, I must say, still is very good as compared to the intel varients.Looks wise: AWESOME! I never needed a Gaming Looking kind of a device so this thing does the perfect job in that front.CPU: I havent actually unleashed the beast yet as I am not that hardcore with the use.SSD: This game me about 4bgps of read and 3.5bgps of write speeds. NICEHDD: It has a Toshiba's hdd that does the job down with about 300mbps of read and write speed.The OS is on the 256 M.2 NVMe PCIE (obviously), so, if you want to change the hdd to a SATA SSD, thats without any issue.The device comes with a good amount of packaging support. BUT it does not have a carry bag which could have been an awesome deal if it had one.I got a good deal with 55k only for this."
5,Everything is perfect!Well i was hoping for a good battery backup butit‚Äôs same as other laptops in this price range in terms of battery performanceBut you can get better batter backup using hybrid mode so it‚Äôs fine.One thing i can surely tell you that under 70k budget it‚Äôs the best laptop u can get now.Thermals are awesome and fans are not loud even in performance mode.120hz screen feels really smoothI bet you won‚Äôt switch to 60hz after using it.Overall it‚Äôs a good laptop and if you want to buy it you can go for it without any second thoughts but remember you won‚Äôt get battery backup for 8 hrs while playing games...2hrs-3hrs max u can get if it‚Äôs charged 100 percent but after turning on hybrid mode + lowering your brightness to 50-60 percent you can get battery backup upto 4-5 hrs.
5,"Great product for ~70k price point. Even though there are laptops Lenovo gameing pad 3 for almost the same spec for ~5k less  , I still went with this because of the port configuration and specially the cooling system . Legion  has OP cooling system and tons upgradability . Got the package with in 2 days and was delivered without any hassle . Only issue is the GPU is 1650 varient . Would have been really OP if there was a 1660 varient under 70k."
5,This Laptop is the best buy u can get under 70k if u r looking for a gaming machine.The thermals are amazing... You can play most of the AAA titles without any lag from medium to high settings... And even though the material is plastic it's biuld like a tank doesn't feel cheap in any way...However there is one con with this device and no it's not the screen brightness like it or not this is the best screen resolution and brightness u can get under this budget and a couple more devices use it... The problem lies with the bleeding it's a lot more than you would like to see... But apart from that it's a perfect device and I would suggest to go for it
4,"The screen is more on a warmer side ,Battery is averaged for office usage or entertainment purpose (lasts around 2.5 hours at 3brightnessIt has 0-7 level for brightness and 0-1 is useless with close to 0 visibility due to warm shades produced on screenRGB production is valued at 33.8%For gaming battery lasts around 50 minutesVery good drivers for sound production and can be used for midi controls over productionSound card badLaptop turns into thermal mode often during games setting at ultra or highCS:GO would easily turn the fans on making it cause more power"
5,"I JUST LOVED IT.Don't compare it with any laptop under 75k, it really has destroyed the competition.HERE ARE SOME PROS AND CONS THAT I FOUND AFTER A MONTH OF USAGE ...PROS1. BUILD QUALITY =>  It has one of the finest build  quality around this budget, it goes head on with  the Asus Tuf lineup in terms of build quality.2. DESIGN => Just loved the minimalistic design, I love aggressive gaming look but I loved  this minimal design.3. TEMPERATURES => One of the key selling  features of this laptop is it's cooling system, it  really is the coolest gaming laptop in the market  rn.4.  Keyboard => It doesn't have a customisable RGB  keyboard but it's so damn good that I don't mind  not having RGB.5.  Performance => It really is a beast.-------------------------------------------------‚Äì---------Cons1. SCREEN => It doesn't feel bright enough to me.2. Build üòë => I know I mentioned it in the pros,  although it is a sturdy laptop but the hinges don't  seem to be that promising ‚òπÔ∏è.3. BUGS => The Vantage software is great but it  needs a lot of improvements. Worst bug is that it  resets all the settings after a restart . But this  could be easily fixed with an update.------------------------------------------------------------Every machine has Cons, but I think if this one month usage was a demo, I'd still buy the legion as it has much more positives than one or two negatives.IMPORTANT TIP : If you want to take your legion's perfory to a whole new level then just add an 8gb ram stick.HOPE YOU FIND THIS HELPFUL AND IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A LAPTOP IN THIS BUDGET THE LEGION HAS NO COMPETITION.JUST GO FOR IT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT !üëçüëçüëçSORRY FOR ANY ERRORS..."
5,"Okay so I had to get a replacement done for this laptop once because the left control button was sticky. Amazon replaced it and the laptop is fantastic for the price.Performance is one of the best that you could get out of a 1650 and R5 4600H because of the thermals and ability to disable optimus.Battery is nothing to write a song about. 3 hours max with Hybrid mode off.Display is surprisingly good. Black levels are great, color reproduction is very good. (Not accurate but very good) comparing to my Elitebook 840 with 98%sRGB, this doesn't look bad at all. +120hz refresh is amazing. Lil bit of ghosting. Brightness is quite high over 300nits for me is pretty darn good.Lenovo could work on QC a little bit. Parts not checked properly for all the components.Amazon service was amazing as usual. Replacements on point."
1,Actually this is very worst product if you wanted to purchase it for an editing laptop ... colour are so bad ..... brightness is very low.RGB is very badHeavy weight is not portable.Size is also large for a 15.6inch display.take more space of your bag .
4,"Thermals are overkill for this specs so the only which would kill this laptop would be dust so take care of operating surrounding. Overall a must buy laptop but with few years the GPU won't handle much of stuff., can't complain cuz we are in India where we are buying a 1000 dollar laptop for gtx 1650 where for the same price overseas we would get a 1660ti. Packing was bad with tape worn out so I suspected foul play but it turned out to be packaging issue.On a side note: Kudos to Lenovo sales team for selling a 2020 laptop in '21 with higher prices than that of overseas."
5,overall its amazing at 65kThe ssd speed is almost near to that of samsung 970 evo plusthe thermals are amazing the gpu temp never goes above 57¬∞Cit is a bit heavythe keyboard is a little disappointingthe lenevo vantage app offers many optimization settingsthe touch pad is smooth.i got 200+ fps in valaorant at low settings.all 4 USB Type A ports are 3.1 Gen 1Type c port can't charge the laptop
4,A decent device if your budget is below 70k. Bought this mainly for mid-tier gaming and coding.Listed out Pros & Cons below.Pros: 1) Good laptop for AAA games if you are looking to run them at medium settings and around 60fpsAC Valhalla - 45+ fpsAC Odyssey - 50+ fpsThe Division 2 - 60+ fpsStar Wars: Jedi fallen Order - 60+ fpsGTA V - 80+ fps2) Pretty good sound system and a snappy keyboard.3) Awesome cooling system where temps hardly go above 80.Cons: 1) Screen brightness is too low to my likeness.2) Battery backup is really pathetic even while not gaming. Hardly getting 3hrs on minimal usage.3) Lenovo warranty is kind of dubious as my warranty start date and purchase date does not match. Have reached out to support but ticket is still pending. Will update if any response.4) Camera quality is bad. Suffices for casual meetings and calls.
5,Best laptop in this budget. I bought it in 68k.
5,"The laptop is great. nice keyboard. build quality is top notch. just the brightness is not good. 250 nits is a setback. 300 would have been perfect. Webcam is typical (bad). thermals are amazing.get ur legion too guys, its better than tuf, nitro and pavilion gaming. can't say abt 5600h nitros"
4,"Overall performance is great in this range. However,The battery is the biggest disappointment. It barely runs for 2 hrs on balanced usage.Also the built quality is not great in this range and these are the areas where i think this product lags.My reviews are based on 3 months of usage."
5,"I am writing for 2 days usages .Battery - 85%Standing 4 to 5 hrs without gaming.Speed - 90%Login and logout , page surfing all are goodDisplay - 100%Smooth looking and good to viewCamera - 75%Good in meet callsSound - 85%Slight noise is there but good oneHardware - 100%Matt finish , quality keys , smooth ports and keybord light nice lookingOS - 100%Original OS but MS Office is trail only not original that's disappointed lotOverall - 90%Go for it ."
5,"Writing this review after 10 continuous days of usage.If you can get this laptop below 65k with offers and sale it is still the best option on market if you are a casual gamer or one interested in esports titles rather than AAA games.Processor - Ryzen 4600h is a beast in performance. The laptop boots up in 5 seconds and generally uses around 30 percent of the processor for general gaming. It is future proof easily for next 3 to 4 years so if you want to work on codings, 3d modelling and video editing for 1080p it is a perfect option.Graphics - GTX 1650 is an entry level gpu but still provides great fps for esports titles. I got 90 fps for PES 2021 and around 80 to 90 in COD Warzone. It will be able to play all pre 2020 games for 60 fps at medium to ultra settings. Also since the display is connected to nvidia gpu it provides better fps stability and response.RAM - it has onboard 8GB 3200MHz ram. I suggest you to upgrade it to 16 Gig by adding another 8 Gb stick as it will improve both your gaming and editing performance due to dual channel.DISPLAY - display is 120hz ips fhd panel with 280 nits brightness. It is really bright enough for indoors and has 63 percent srgb. Good for students and general editor but wouldn't recommend for a professional editor.Keyboard and touchpad - lenovo always has the best keyboards and there is no exception here the keyboard is smooth has great key travel and works really well. There is only one backlight of white color no rgb. Touchoad is really good smooth and highly responsive.BATTERY - you cant expect too much battery life from a gaming laptop but if you use this laptop on hybrid mode and at quiet mode i got 5 hours of screen on time with youtube and general works. Rapid charge feature is really great and charges laptop much quicker. When gaming or intensive work you should on conservative mode it will cut the power for laptop battery thus improving the life of battery.OTHERS - speakers aren't generally highlight of gaming laptops but it has still a good pair with nice quality and little bit of bass. Wifi 6 and bt 5.1 are included. Windows 10 home is preinstalled and fully licensed.UPGRADE - it has 256 gb ssd and 1tb hdd which is enough but if you want faster storage you can upgrade hdd to ssd and used the left out hdd as your external storage using an adapter. Has dual channel ram which can be upgraded to 32 gb but 16gb is enough for gaming.Overall a Brilliant laptop in price segment. You can wait for upcoming rtx 3050 entry level laptops but they are definitely gonna be above 75k to 80k so if you are at a hard 65 k budget then go for it."
3,"First of all the initial unboxing was really good. Loved it. But as soon I opened the laptop, I was dumbstruck upon seeing the Legion logo not glowing. Upon inspection it had a layer of laminate.Okay the first impressions were:1) Laptop is blazing fast man (With the pairing of Ryzen 5 and GTX 1650) it's a feast to your eye coming from 60hz.2) Camera was really bad (considering every gaming laptop camera)3) Battery is really bad (You have to limit your usage pretty much to no internet for getting a good percentage of battery left). I used YouTube for like an hour and the battery depleted way soon. Would've been nice if they had included an option to change the hz to 60.4) Installing softwares went really good. But when i installed and opened 'Your phone' app, the laptop went black. I restarted 4 times and it remained black. But upon 5th restart it became normal.5) Okay guys the main disadvantage of this freakin laptop (more like the seller's fault) Instead of the promised 1 year warranty, i was given 9 months. Come on man that's no way fair.6) Thermals are pretty good after a hour of CSGO and there were no framedrops or so.7) Would really recommend this laptop for anybody who can roam around with the adaptor given and are in need of a proper gaming lot with good thermals.(Also instead of the usual selling price of 68k, the seller sold me this for 75k and I being in need of a good laptop bought this with no second thoughts. Pls don't buy this if the price goes more than 72k.)"
5,"According to me it is 100% worth to buy this laptop in the budget of under 70K.Let us now discuss about it's pros&cons:Pros:1.In fps games like VALORANT,CSGO,etc.It has given me 150+fps in Valorant and arnd 80-90 fps sometimes 100+ on Gta5 High and1080P.2.Second,comes it's thermals,which are very very much optimised,you got 4 air vents for cooling.3.Third is it's display which is connected direct to the Nvidia gpu and its Igpu is disabled.4.Minimum fan noise,your cieling fan can make more noise than this Laptop's fan.5.It's sound quality is above average,it comes with 2 speakers of 2-2 Watts each powered by Harman.Con's:There are not very much cons in this laptop but what I found is that:1.There should be a rgb keyboard at this price range in the Laptop but Lenovo doesn't provide us in this.It's battery backup is also not that bad,it's OK 3/5 for the Battery backup."
4,This review is written after one week of use. Overall the product is best to use. Display is perfect. Battery life can be improved. I gets around 5 hrs on average continuous use. sound system can be much better. Camera quality is below average.
1,"Got the faulty laptop with display bleeding issue.First impressions:If you're think this is an ultra book, you ar wrong. Its quite thick and heavy. Completely made of plastic. Atleast for me the laptop frizzed couple of times. Camera is awful. Keyboard feedback 0, could have been beter.Asked Amazon for replacement, for the screen issue, not sure what is wrong with them, they are sending technician and then they will decide.Verdict: i would prefer to get refund as i feel in this prolice range you can get better build and quality laptopUpdate with the replacement laptop as on 16th Ocr 21:The replacement laptop is also defective. Same issue with the screen. I'm returning the laptop and getting refund."
1,"Very poor camera quality and not satisfied with this laptop performance. Amazon not specified about camera details in their website, manufacturer cheated amazon, amazon cheated customer."
3,Been using this for about 3 weeks now. Product looks good in pics but is a bit flimsy and very basic audio quality. I had bought this for online schooling purposes but laptop speakers are barely loud to hear the teachers voice so o am having to use additional speakers to solve the issue. Wonder why laptop makers go so miserly on such basic things. I can understand we cannot expect a BnO level audio but even boat speakers are better!!However the god points being the hardware confit which gives u ssd and hdd so start up is quick. In summary:Pros:1. Good ssd and hdd configuration will give you faster speeds2. Built in office package3. 3 USB ports and type c connectivity4. I5 processor at high clock speedsCons:1. Pricing could be much  lower given the overall package i bought it for base price of about 55k2. Plastic buddy not very sturdy. I have a Lenovo ideapad which is also plastic but much sturdier than this3. Below average audio4. Very average webcam5. Below par  Audio and video combination kill the basic purpose of online schooling
5,"I was skeptic buying laptop online, but Amazon has never disappointed me yet.Asus was amazingly great! This is my first laptop of this brand, I was not sure but this is a top level laptop. Smooth and advanced with lots of space and good for gaming, but as I don't play much games so I am not gonna say more on gaming!"
1,"Awful amazon service. Ordered this laptop on 6thoct, received a faulty piece which didnt switch on at all. Been calling for replacement/return continuously. Not yet happened. Horrible experience"
5,I wish it was little more faster. Otherwise it's very good Laptop and value for money.
5,Excellent laptop with good processor.processing speed is nice.all features are nice.internet a bit slow
4,EXCELLENT!
1,No charger
4,"I ordered this laptop on 06 Oct 2021.Display quality- 8/10keyboard - 5/10performance - 9/10Battery Life-  as of today- 7/10 (need to use if for atleast a month or two then will update the review)OS, Software- 8/10Amazon deal- 9/10Camera quality- 2/10Customisation- 7/101.Original price is 66k, Got this for 39K, in exchange of my 10 years old asus i3 2nd gen laptop (9K value) in Amazon festival with other HDFC offers.Laptop is fast, as it is i5 11th Gen. and 8 GB ram with 256ssd HD.2. I tried looking for it's reviews and photos all over internet but didnt find any proper pic or review of exactly this model even on website.3. So the keyboad is not backlit keyboard. Its only chicklet keyboard and I am nt happy with the way it is. at this cost they could have provided backlit keyboard. Also in the product images on amazon glowing logo on keyboard is shown, and since it is 2021, I thought this must be having backlit keyboard. And the colour of letters and numbers is grey on silver keys, this combination is not good from viewing angle.4. Laptop doesnt fill that light weight, it must be weighing around 1.8 kg.5. Performance is good as of now. Installing apps , working fine. did nt try heavy apps yet.  shall update it's review after some time.6. There is no memory card reader slot in this laptop. There is no indication on front , if laptop is starting after u press the power button- this is absolutly rubbish. You will come to knw only whn ur screen will be on. else keep looking on side edge of laptop.7. Display quality is amazing. I am enjoying it.8. Laptop came with windows 10 and office and MCaffe for 1 year preinstallled. Happy to use it.9. Got a good deal, wait for few more reviews. then decide in next amazon festival.10. Laptop boots very fast. and the fingerprint scanner works amazing, responce is quick."
5,"An extremely good product, the touch is so helpful. The only issue is the battery backup, which is not adequate, needs improvement"
4,"I purchased this PC for my daughter school use..  It has a nvme drive (which is ligtniging fast) and 8 GB ram.Performance is decent. It comes with some bloat ware like lenovo tools, mcaffee anti-virus etc.. I promptly removed the mcafee antivirus (which is only a trial version), and the perfomeance improved quite a bit.I wish the display has 16:10 ratio, so it would have been much better for web browsing, online classes etc, but looks like only macbook has this display ratio.I am now dual booting with Linux Elemenatary OS, and it is remarkably much quicker to boot, much faster than windows.I am okay with the machine, I would have preffered to save on the unnecessary cost of Windows, as I am not usiing it.There are also a few brands like HP selling at this price point, I picked this one though due to the lighted keypad and fingerprint scanner.Camera and speakers are okay.. Just laptop quality.. External webcams will be better."
5,"One of the best laptop in this category. Did lot of research on HP, dell n Lenovo. But this one is the best. Using this since a month. Sleek, light wgt, premium look, finger lock. Highly recommended."
3,"Good performance ... no issues. However the body does not Talk about quality, extremely lightweight and feels cheap plastic.  Not sure about durability ... finally, u get what u pay for."
1,I brought this laptop on 14 Aug. After 7 days the display is not working. Don't buy this laptop.
4,Very good lap for student usage and movie watching.
1,Had a horrible experience with quality. The laptop went dead within few days of arrival and Lenovo service response was pathetic. Will never touch a Lenovo product ever again.
4,Sleek and lightweight
5,"Beautiful, sleek and clear image. Super fast"
5,"I bought it couple of days back, no complains and speed is also pretty good for personal use."
4,Only issue is with the WAN port which is a c type.
1,"Whenever I order the product, I was very excited to unbox the new product with high configuration.I received the product on 3rd day and packing was normal. I unbox the product and setup all the thing.Its working fine and running smoothly as per the expectation but on 3rd day suddenly I got lines on the screen.I was worried about that and so that raise the request for replacement and after many follow-up the product was picked up after 9 days (don't know what was the issue but every executive replying with the different statement) and got the new product after 4th day of pickup.After Replacement:I receive the replaced product and check all the configuration of the product.Packing was good. I unbox the product and setup all the necessary thing.music was playing on the system and screen was off because of time out.I clicked on the mouse button to wake the screen but system does wakeup and start doing the beep type sound like ""trrrrrrrrrrrrrr unnununununu"".I wait some time for restart but it beeping continuously and then I shutdown by pressing the power button.I turn on the system and I was getting start blue Screen Error (BSOD) continuously.I tried many thing to restore the windows but nothing was working then i choose the last option to reset the windows. but after the windows resetting. I lost many necessary applications like Microsoft Store, Mail box and many more.After that I Install the fresh windows by format all drives and setup again all necessary thing.acer didn't provide recovery drive so that you can reinstall the OEM version again if anything happen.we know that the product key was installed in the BIOS so that every use can install windows many times and copy of the windows will be activated and became genuine.But its not the OEM modified version. It will be the normal version released by the Microsoft. Acer needs to provide the recovery drive.This is a gaming laptop with the most high configuration of this series. This expectation will not be considerable by any user. Manufacture need to focus to fix this type of issues."
1,"Worst purchase ever, don't purchase this laptop.when u call to acer support they will tell u why you purchase laptop from Amazon or Flipkart and not have service center and mostly mentioned center are closed.on acer website laptop extended warranty cost you 2000 rupees and if u purchase it from Amazon u need to visit service center and they ask me 15000 for same warrenty.acer support team is not working and their support website is mostly all time down.i even attached screenshot what I got.dont purchase acer laptop ever.it will spoil your time.they tell u to register within 7 days of laptop purchase but website will down for 15 days and no any response from support team."
5,"Very nice preforming gaming laptop, no heating issue, value for money, best for coding, storage options are very good."
3,The laptop is gr8 ..overheating issues but nothing to worry about.....the battery is horrible tho
5,"As per specifications it's a great deal & value for money. I got it for 75k with exchange offer.It's build quality is NOT top notch like any other gaming laptop but it's good for this price.As for playing games yes I have been playing with AC power supply cause battery drains fast.screen quality is good also for gamers but not for designers who want the most detailed coloring.Two fan design is great as it's cooling the cpu and GPU very fast, But if they are on max it's sounds like a Jet engine.Overall it's a great buying option for who want play games and use heavy softwares,Its work fast.I recommend it for this price range upto 85kDo buy it when it on sale, as per original price build quality is not so great."
5,"Im a student and convincing dad to buy me a laptop ( gaming laptop ) in range of price more then 80k was not at all possible ,,,so getting this through all these offers is worth it ,,, buy it definetly if you are getring this under 80k or even around 80k ,,,,but if getting above 85k ,,,i might suggest go for asus tuf(i7 11th gen , 16gb ram, 1TB ssd , wirh webcam and number pad)"
5,I like the display quality best for gaming and work best I mainly like the keyboard RGB light EXELLENT LAPTOP NEVER SEEN VERY FAST DELIVERY WITHOUT A SCRATCH
1,Its performance is reduced after 3 weeks .Company is not accepting to change .
5,Super product
1,"Don't fall for it's specifications, it has the lowest benchmark compare to other i7 11800h laptop. Acer just fooling people with such spec. Also the screen quality is pathetic it's not 300 nits brightness as they claim. Speaker is horrible. Battery life and sound quality is average as an gaming laptop.....Biggest drawback it's proccessor power :("
2,"Worst Battery lifeScreen Quality is bad. My previous lenovo ideapad C340 laptop has better screen quality than this. Colours are just dull. you wont enjoy watching movies/series on this laptop.Not portable. Its very heavy.It charges very slow. My previous 30k laptop used to charge around more than 50%-60% in 40-45 minutes.Even doing the simple tasks like working on word or excel consumes lot of battery.After full charge, it on screen time is not more than 3 hours which is really bad.DONOT  GO FOR IT..! I tried to return it but amazon ditched me and didn't care if i am satisfied with the product or not and didnt refund my amount."
5,Really excellent laptop I like this laptop I play games like free fire and bgmi this is best gaming laptop I like please buy this also ok! Bye
5,I bought acer nitro 5 1 month ago...I wanted RTX 3060TI  BUT IT WASNT THERE so I bought RTX 1650 Ti  and this one made me soo jealous can I get a exchange (üòÇ)  ....I recommend u buy this laptop
2,CS GO FPS drops in game.Body and Keyboard - Poor build qualityMediocre CameraAudio in 3.5mm jack issue - headphones go undetected in game
3,I had a nitro 5...  I didn't know before i purchased one... that the CPU frequency drops to 1.5 Ghz if its on battery.... you will 2.5 Ghz only when its on power. It is set at bios level so you cannot change that at all...
5,"Perfect laptop for gaming, what an amazing accessories combination... Must buy!Perfect for gaming...awesome...GTX 3050 TIAlso It's not that costly"
5,Is the graphic card present here of 8gb or 4gb?In description it's mentioned as 8gb of Nvidia RTX 3050
1,"Bought the Mi Ultra laptop during the first sale on 31st Aug. Extremely disappointed with the laptop as well as Mi Support.12/09: Laptop doesn't turn on anymore. It has been 10 days, so cannot even return it. On the 6th day, the laptop went into a continuous restart loop which I fixed with hard shut down 3 times after watching some YouTube videos. And then it was working okay for 2 days. Now it doesn't even start. The charge light also doesn't come on. Nothing happens on pressing the power button. Nothing happens when you connect the charger. It's dead. Need to take it to the service center just 10 days into the purchase! Don't buy this, all the great specs are useless if it doesn't start!Update 13/09: I gave it for service and they are saying the battery and motherboard is defective and they need to replace it! I'm shocked. It's a brand new laptop and in 10 days the battery and motherboard is gone? How can that happen? I've hardly even used it! And they also say that since it's a new laptop the parts are taking time to come to the service center! Better to buy a reliable HP, Dell, Lenovo laptop even if it's a bit more expensive!Update 20/09: It has been with Mi service center for 8 days now. Everytime I call them they say it will get fixed in 2 days. On probing further they said there is a hardware problem. The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced! Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase? It's clearly a manufacturing defect from Xiaomi. They say they have ordered the parts but they haven't received it since it's a new model! Unbelievable!Just lost lot of money and peace with this laptop! Don't trust Xiaomi from now.23/09: They called me from the service center and asked me to collect a replacement laptop. I got a brand new laptop unopened and I opened it and checked in the service center itself. It seems that they couldn't fix the old laptop and had to send it back, so I got lucky. Else, I would have got a repaired one.Anyway, I'm happy I got a new replacement laptop and currently it's working well."
5,"Pros:1) Build quality.2) Display (best I have ever seen amongst laptops).3) Keyboard, great typing experience.4) Fingerprint, lightening fast.Cons:1) Sound speakers downwards, would have been better on surface. Unfortunately, I have never seen good speakers in mid range laptop. Mac speakers are definitely good, but with a price tag.Overall: Value for money.Yet to test:1) Battery.2) Performance."
1,"Overall product is good, but charger is missing in package, and web cam is very bad quality"
5,"Thanks to livetre.com who's reviewing this laptop right now. Like many already pointed out the volume is very low when you get the laptop and also the keyboard backlight goes off after every 15 sec if not touched.? But there's a fixIn the windows start search 'dts' and open the app called dts audio processing and choose the Game Mode t0 get loud sound.And for the keyboard backlight to get always on, Restart and press F2 to enter in to bios. look for keyboard backlight power and set to standard mode instead of power save mode for backlight.only downside of this laptop is the trackpad click. Due to large trackpad the clicks feels stiff and weird."
5,"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.Pros:1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD &  i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!Cons:1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to someOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India."
4,"I bought this on 8th Sep. The laptop is good and definitely value for money.But there was no Mi extended warranty option when you buy from Amazon. I wrote to Amazon and the response was to contact in case I do not get any response by 17th. But on 18th the option of chat contact was also closed (return window closed on 17th, - I did not understand the connection as the question is not about return)nor did I get any response through email.  It is cheating as you pay the same price for curtailed benefits but you are not told of this upfront. This leaves bad tase in the whole buying experience. For the first time I am unhappy with both Amazon and Xiaomi."

Build quality is awesome too.. battery life was decent for my working (around 7-8 hours) over all for 68k it was a steal deal for me.."

5,Beyond ExpectationsüòÅ
5,"This is a great product for this price range... No regrets buying it... Here are few pros and cons I've observed in 48 hours of usage.1. Built quality is amazing but make no mistake, it's high quality plastic built and not metal. It's not a very slim laptop but not too bulky as well! The laptop looks more like a Mashup of traditional design as well as modern slim design.2. Screen quality is above average with amazing viewing angles and good colors. But then again this is not a oled or amoled... Black levels are moderate. During black screen, you can clearly see white light seeping in from the light source on the edges of the screen. Touch screen works amazing though! I particularly buy touch screen laptops as it makes for an amazing web browsing experience with one of my hand on the screen ready to scroll through content lot faster than track pad. Even single clicks on OK and Agree are lot faster to tap on screen than move the cursor.3. Amazing speed... No second thoughts about it... Although I'm not a gamer. Less than 10 secs to boot.4. Maybe because of the summer. But the laptop runs on the hotter side.... I didn't see any impact on the performance but not a laptop you could actually keep it on your lap!5. Track pad works well but the click compression could have been smoother and firmer... Instead it feels a bit flimsy6. No complaints on the keyboard side... The fact that it's backlit only adds to its strength. Finger print reader is good and another worthy mention7. The laptop is quite heavy and as such comfortably using it in tablet mode is more of a marketing gimmick than an important feature. I don't see the sense in tent mode as well, it's just laptop mode with no keyboard.8. B&O speakers do its job well... The sound quality is definitely on the good side.9. Decent battery backup... Can easily expect 4 to 5 hours of continuous usage... although this is only my 48 hour experience.My overall experience is this laptop is still the best buy in the market for this price range... This is my 7th HP laptop and this company's greatest strength is it's laptops can be easily repaired by anyone anywhere. Kinda like Maruti Suzuki of the car world! It's not BMW, but Maruti Suzuki has its own fan following."
4,"It's good product, best in range.I got it today itself.But I am worried, it's heating too much in few seconds . Can somebody help me to understand why it is heating so much?"
5,"Awesome laptop, the screen quality is great, performance is awesome, don't go by the i3 moniker, has an all mettalic body, touchpad is large, the fingerprint scanner is fast, speakers are okay, battery backup is good, the SSD is super fast, boots in about 6 seconds, has 2 USB  Type A ports, one USB Type C port, one HDMI port, a 3.5 mm jack (headphone and microphone), an SD card slot and a barrel connector. The backlit keyboard is bright and it also charges through the Type C port... Best product for its price... Other brands charge upto 70k for a device of this calibre and quality. The touchscreen works pretty well. Feels very premium (upto MacBooks)..."
4,"This is an average speced laptop for the price, so, here are the ratings,Screen quality- Not the best, the colours aren't accurate, it's a bright laptop for sure, but if you want to watch movies in 4k HDR or 1080p, this isn't the way to go, it messes with the colours ergo, not that great. If you need a nice screen increase your budget, but this is average for the price, still good but not the best you can get for the price. And remember the touch screen is not that useful in day to day life unless you're drawing something or you're into reading a lot and arts, if this is not you go for a standard laptop not 2 in 1.So, a solid 7/10.For Gaming- A big NO, if you want to game this is the worst decision you would make, first of all i3 which is a good processor for day to day activities like chrome and work with word and other microsoft office tools, but that also if pushed to limits it'll start becoming slow, so, if you like to open up 10-15 tabs at once and do 4-5 projects at once this won't be your best choice, now if the laptop can't handle that it certainly cannot handle gaming ofcourse it can handle some small games but mostly nothing from the epic store so, if gaming is the main purpose look for i5 and non touch screen laptops. Also it's a convertible so, everyone understands, no gaming. So for gaming a solid 3/10.Keyboard and trackpad- The keyboard is nice and clicky although there's some flex in between but that doesn't play a major role, it's a good typing experience but it's a 14 inch laptop so ofcourse no numpad, but the keyboard is Good and the backlit is also good it goes very bright in dark conditions, helps a lot, now the trackpad isn't durable it feels cheap, for long term usage I don't know it'll last or not but it is still an okay-ish trackpad, but it does feel cheap.So, keyboard a solid 10/10Trackpad a 8/10CPU- As I said earlier it's a good CPU for day to day tasks, if you're buying a laptop for your parents or your child this CPU works like a charm, for the price you could get an i5 but that won't be a convertible. If you want to game, then no, because the multi core performance in this one isn't that good, so, light games can be played but if you really want to game and code and stuff like a lot, go for i5 or ryzen CPUs. So, a solid 9/10 for the CPU one deducted because it cannot handle occasional big tasks, like opening up 20 tabs at once but still no one ever does that.RAM- 8 Gb enough, but again if you're a multi Tasker of big projects at once then you might need to upgrade it but for normal people 8GB is enough.A solid 10/10Storage- The SSD works like a charm, the laptop boots up under 10-15 seconds, and goes from sleep to wake in under 3 seconds, file transfer speeds are always above 100 Mbps on the USB 3.0 or type C port I always use those, way faster than HDD, don't go for HDD, your life will be hell, SSD is smooth fast and more durable and no risk of losing any data. So, a solid 10/10.Battery life- Oh the battery life, 3-4 hours, max to max 5 hours, the battery life is like a gaming laptop but the internals aren't, the battery life isn't good, there are laptops in the price range offering way more. If you're an on the go person don't go for this, the charging speed is nice, charges the laptop in under 2 hours, it depends, whether you're working with the charger plugged in or you aren't working while it's plugged in. So, for the battery life, 6/10, and charging, 9/10.Ports- All important ports are available the fingerprint sensor is also fast, so don't worry about that.A solid 10/10Camera- Ridiculous camera, if you do a lot of video conferences you have to buy a separate camera.A solid 4/10.Speakers- Oh the speakers are loud no complaints with that, it cannot ofcourse function as a speaker from Bang and Olufsen but works like a charm on a laptop, but when it's in tablet mode the speakers fire down then the sounds are low, but on laptop mode the speakers are good.A solid 9/10Chassis- It's Plastic the top feels plastic, trackpad is plastic, everything is plastic nothing feels premium, average chassis for the price, it's durable not compromising on durability, but it doesn't feel that good.So, a 7/10One big negative point for the laptop, if you're just doing browsing or small tasks even then it starts to heat up, the portion where the vents are located, the vents are located at a bad bad place one cannot hold the laptop because of the heat it produces. A big negative of this laptop. It heats up fast and too much.All in all its an average laptop for the price compromising on many things just because it's a 2 in 1 if you're not into art or projects related to that don't buy this, buy a standard laptop it offers way more than this. I would recommend this laptop for home purposes like for parents or students, not for gamers and working professionals, still good, but you can go for the better ones. But the heating issue is a really big problem."
5,"Hats off to Amazon, HP & Microsoft Customer Care Support all 3 are Great Customer Service, always ready to help, 5Star to all 3.

Heating issue, with the use of just 5 minutes like simple browsing the laptop started heating like thava.3. Physical damage near the borders of the screen.Thanks to Amazon for their excellent customer care support. First we got replacement but the replaced laptop also had the same issues.

1,"Laptop hangs a lot.. I made a complaint to the customer care, and there was a diagnostic process taken online and found out to be a problem in this laptop and they offered me a replacement despite after telling that the confidence in this laptop is gone.Thanks to Amazon for accepting the refund after the replacement."
5,Bht achha leptop hai ..mujhe to kafi pasand aaya ....maine ise 52500 mai liya hai ...avi new hai to utna aage ka to nhi bata skta ki kaisa chalega ..lekin avi to achha hi chal raha haiüòÖüòÖ
3,Gets extremely hot within a few secs of turning it on..n way too heavy..also there is some screen damage or lighting issue at the top edge..I‚Äôve seen similar reviews..didn‚Äôt know it was just 7 days return period..missed it..just ensure a thorough check is done cos looks like Amazon is selling some not so good hp laptops
5,"The laptop is just like I expected, with its aluminium body it just feels premium to have on your deskthe laptop with the 11th gen chip inside is powerful enough to handle most of your task easilyI prefer anyone who is looking for a good budget 2 in 1 laptop to just go for it and you won't be disappointed"
1,Product received was a defective one. Crashed on its maiden use. Also it heats up very fast and gets very hot. Also customer service was not able to help much. The return and refund policy is very bad. We have to wait for the technician to confirm that it is defective. Our opinion doesn't matter.
1,After 20 days web cam is not working getting heatup and laptop screen damaged by technical engineer he came for web cam repair very bad experience with this product now they are not ready to replacement. Struggling with this issue from last 4 weeks
5,Bought this a month ago. So far so good. Good performance overall. Productivity has increased after an upgrade.It will be nice if it detects the orientation and changes automatically.The most pointer gets stuck at times when you use both touchpad and the screen alternatively.
1,Worst quality laptop.i don't recommend anybody to buy this.the laptop is dead with no power just after 10days.the engineer visited says the mother board is not working.HP provide refurbished laptops. Don't buy.better choose dell.
1,The new laptop stopped working in 2 months. It's not booting now and HP engineer is not able to attend the problem. Motherboard got crashed within 2 months of very minimum usage.Very unsatisfied with response from Amazon and HP.
1,Laptop crashed in 3 months time‚Ä¶ it is dead for 2 weeks‚Ä¶ service engineer visited once‚Ä¶ HP teams assures part will be received every next day‚Ä¶ written to India support head but no change in situation‚Ä¶ should not buy this product
1,Battery stopped working after 2 days of use and there‚Äôs no change policy as well
5,Value for moneyScreen quality awesomeBattery back up is very lowMaximum the back up is coming upto 3 hours only
3,"I had to go to the local warehouse as the Delivery code was printed wrong by amazon. I had to travel 5 kms for that to a unknown village for collection. If it wasn‚Äôt urgent, I‚Äôd have canceled it."
5,Happy with the product. Packaging is good received in 2 days. this is my Initial impression and not a review - Laptop performance is excellent and good battery backup. 250 nits brightness is more than enough for a non photoshop/video editing user.In addition Dell Cinema Color S/W enhances the viewing experience by providing 4 picture profiles.It is having Dual channel 8+8 ram which is a nice thing to have. 512 GB SSD is WD brand. Product looks classy and no unnecessary stickers around touch pad only intel stickers provided. Finger print sensor is responsive.Like the color of the laptop.
5,"Very good customer service by the seller. Amazing laptop. Speacial thanks to Mr. Vikas from Dell - DCC Infotech Prvt Ltd, Mumbai üôè."
3,The laptop functions well but is a power guzzler. It also shuts down once in a day or two without rhyme or reason.
5,Totally satisfied.Display is very good.Touch functionality works very well.Stylus is bit laggy. Magnetic chip has not provided in the box.Sound quality is nice but low sound.Overall great product. I got the deal for ‚Çπ44500 üòä
2,"I'm so disapointed .After spending so much of money to get a laptop with this sort of camera is just pathetic ...with Work  from home and study from home , camera is very important . this laptop's camera is the worst I have ever seen ...even the first mobile I had 10+ years back had a better camera...it's that bad.  What surprises me that at this level,. How can a company like ASUS even allow such low grade camera to be part of this build...don't waste your hard earned money ...go for a DELL or a HP ..just horrible."
4,"Just wow!I gifted to my niece and she just loved it. Online education makes her easy now. She can spend time with this. Laptop smoothness is great. The Stylus, finger print, processor and everything makes its beauty. This is one of the fast machine for moderate use.I would recommend to all!"
5,"Pros:1) Not used, but My ASUS App seems to be great to obtain hassle free service, if applicable. Seems to have dedicated service centres as well. The app provide driver upgrades as well automatically, once configured.2) Windows 10 Home edition. Compatible for Windows 11 upgrade.3) Packed with MS Office 2019 Home & Student, with lifetime validity.4) 2 in 1 with FHD Touch & 360 Degrees Flip.5) Integrated Graphics.6) 1.50 Kgs.7) Stylus pen provided with the package.8) Fingerprint sensor.9) Combining all the above, Value for money at this price.Cons:1) Placement of speakers could have been on top of keyboard.2) Sound quality could have been improved. Hope the same can achieved through future driver upgrades.3) Camera quality is too low [0.3 MP/4:3 (640x480)]. Better to purchase a quality webcam separately."
5,"Writing this review almost after a month got this laptop on july 27 for my younger sis for her digital artThe battery life is good it can stay on till 7-8 hours for movies and listening music and for working almost 3-4 hours, the camera is okay and the microphone quality is good, speakers are not that loud the volume of the speakers is really very low you can barely hear what is playing on the laptop  and for gaming this is not a gaming laptop so you cannot play any high end games the game would open but you will barely get 10-15 fps (frames per second).It also comes with a stylus which works fine.Not worth for gaming but for graphic designing worth it.Thank you!!"
3,"Like - lightweight compact, good for home use with win 10 and office 2019 preloaded. You can use it from the word go.Dislike - 512GB SSD advertised in the product description. But when I received the laptop and while installing I found that it was 256 GB SSD hard disk. Very disappointing & misleading advertisement. Paid 46.5 K for 256GB, 10th generation I3 processor from a brand like asus is a ripoff. I needed this for my son's and yoga work, hence did not want to go through a complex return process and choosing another one after independence day sale is tiresome. This is not expected from Amazon. I feel cheated."
5,It's apt for everyday use.. touch screen and keypad are smooth to operate and its sleek and light to carry around. Got it during Amazon sale for less than 45k.. absolutely worth it!
2,Very bad design of laptop - usually we never check where camera position is - when we got the laptop the camera position is on left side of below screen - it‚Äôs not even in middle of the screen..on video call our picture is not in middle plus speakers are below the keyboard - so we are not able to listen it properly.Also touch screen stopped working after one month of use
4,"Nice performing laptop with touch screen. 8 think there is no other company providing touch + i3 processor at this price tag ( <45k).2 drawbacks -1. Sound is very poor, I can see its almost unhearable2. Webcam is placed at bottom which gives wrong angle on video call. Only way to get it corrected is by inverting tha laptop. Also there is a wide strap at the bottom of screen but having ASUS label on it. Looks so weird"
5,"Speed is absolutely great.No issues with Microsoft.Audio and video quality are fine.Can be used as both tablet and laptop. Using the pen was a bit tricky.Rest, is all good. Go for it."
1,"don't buy this product, fingerprint not working after windows update.I replace it for same problem 2nd product is having same issue.sound is very low.takes too much time to close.go for another brand."
3,"The laptop works great and all, the only problem that I have with it is tha the webcam is at the bottom of the screen, it's a Tribble place to put camera at, gets really bad angles while I deo calls"
5,Quick shutdown and startup. Touch screen is fantastic. Digipen /fingerprint/backlit keyboard work smoothly. Highly recommended. Pen magnet not provided. Camera quality is quite poor and wierdly placed but suits me as I don't use it much. Overall fantastic purchase
1,A big dislike.. total waste of my hard money
5,Overall the product is very nice and will be very much useful for regular usage purpose.The touch is good and processor is also good and delivering good speed.
2,"Laptop key stopped working, sometimes hanged and now windows issues ... within 10 days"
5,It‚Äôs really beautiful thing and am loving using it
5,"Touch screen super,Pen for this is also super,More over Microsoft packed fantasticGot a good dealAlso got free speakers very less on Amazon great indian festival"
5,Good product
5,It just awsome best touchscreen laptop under 45000 just go for it blindly
5,could be better in sound part
3,Performance is good. But I'm not able to use finger print after having one system update
5,"The touch is amazing, the tab mode is more than helpful."
4,Touch and early start/quickly shutdown...
3,Very poor customer service from Amazon.
5,Perform well in all fields. Nice product.
5,Nothing

5,"I am writing this review after one year 4 months of use and let me break it down into the pros and cons:-Pros:-1) super fast laptop. Boots in seconds.2) amazing touchscreen3) powerful battery4) slim and sleek nd light5) can be folded and flipped and used as a tab6) excellent looks. Backlit keyboard is the cherry on top.7) will serve for your purpose for day to day work and entertainmentCons:-1) very poor speaker quality. Partly becuz speakers are placed underneath.2) webcam is placed at the bottom of the screen which is extremely weird. No idea why they did that.3) memory wise not strong enough for games etc.4) fingerprint sensor tends not to respond at times.Over-all, if the above cons can be managed, one should definitely buy this laptop. Its unbelievably portable and will grab attention anywhere you take it!"
3,"Bought a new laptop & charged for the 1st time, while touching the top of the laptop it's producing static current. If I didn't wear slippers, I feel mild electric shock. Is that normal?.. what if laptop is damaged?. Pls do help on this case."
5,Only one wordAmazingU will never regret for itBest in this price rangeBest for students and working professionals
5,"Fantastic Laptop,Best Laptop under 40k, I contact dell web for delivery but they take minimum 4days of delivery, so I finally purchased on Amazon as same rate as dell website and I received this product on next day,Very good Laptop, i3 10th gen -4GB-250GBM2 type SSD & light weightDue to SSD Boot time is only 8-9 Sec. & Shutdown time takes only 3Sec. 170GB available for Use.You also add SATA Type HDD/SDD (Slot available for this)Windows 10Home & MS-Office home & student (word-excel-Power point) available with this, simple you need to create MS office registration for activation.Display quality is very good and remain same in different angle.Battery Backup is almost 4 to 5hrs, and charger is 45W Fast.Only C type port is not available,I recently updated Windows 10 & Bios, no fan noise is coming from it( Before Update & after Update) Overall Good Product Go for it....."
5,Osam dell 3501 (4/256 SSD ) LeptopSCREEN 5/5PERFORMANCE 5/5BATTERY LIFE 5/5BOOT AND COPY SPEED 5/5
5,The laptop so far had been really good especially for it's working.. I recommend you to buy this compelling laptop!
3,"Its been an month, continuously using it non stop.For office work its fine, but for students its over priced, as light muti-video editing very easily heats up the laptop and fast drainage. i.e;. Normal Battery Standby mode lasts for 4 to 6 hrs and  8 to 12 hours when kept open( if no apps running in battery save mode and dimmed).. Videos play around 2 to 3 hrs if fully charged..No keyboard light, cannot use outdoor in dark places.. No fingerprint sensors..ROM is low..Bad laptop for gaming..even angry bird game heats it up very easily. Some games run but i would personally not recommend to use it..Faster Boots of 10 to 12 sec (in compare to SDD).Fast screen shut down in 2 sec and overall 4 to 5 sec to full shutdown from inside till re-press power button to start up..Ram upto 1.5gb always in use. 3gb if use means confirm heatup. I would not hold it in my lap..Very good for MS office works and Browsing with good touch gestures.SO ITS DEPENDs ON HOW YOU would use THE APPS. Its a good built laptop. . 32- 35000 rupees i would rate it at maximum..or opt to buy a laptop with better processor.. I have deducted the star because there is no servicing in my area and over price hike in recent month. Its september 2021. But Good laptop."
1,"Bought this once, the headphone jack stopped working, ordered a replacement, the mic in the headphone jack was not working, tried to suck it up and use it anyway since work was more important. Two weeks later, guess what, headphone jack stopped working completely. Again. Never buying Dell ever again."
1,"Received worst product from Amazon ever.. I purchase a dell inspiron15 i3 laptop , and I got laptop with windows 10 pirated version , also having major screen problem..."
5,Just perfect with price.
4,Best laptop in this price for normally users.
5,"cool laptop under this budget,and safe package  thanks AMAZON."
1,No back light in keyboard and camera is bad
5,"Awesome laptop. Quite quick with these specs, thanks to SSD. Works perfect and build is also good."
5,Good product
5,Worth for money performance is good
5,"Nothing to say, It's awesome, super fast laptop, must buy it."
5,Great one. Go for it
1,Laptop started giving issues within 2 weeks. What I feel more concerned about is the lack of ownership displayee by both Amazon and Dell.
4,"Ordered this based on immense research. Certainly one of the best options available in this price (~‚Çπ60K). I ordered 2, however the second one was defective, ordered a replacement again, got another defective product. Returned it, ordered a seperate model with 120Hz, received defective charger. Pissed me off. This issue arrised despite Amazon assuring me they will quality check my replacement product.Anyway, the laptop itself, I've bought 2 of. 1 from Amazon and 1 offline from Lenovo (got it cheaper there too) and it's genuinely good. So if you're seeing the reviews to find whether this is a good laptop, YES. It is! I use it for Video Editing and Programming. Programming is tough with just 8GB RAM, I might upgrade that. But the CPU performance I get is great. Not a gamer, so can't speak for that. But Nvidia's 1650 has a fantastic reputation with games, so you need not worry.Buy this laptop over the Legion, TUF and Nitro. It's better overall. As for this seller, make sure you're thoroughly checking your product in the return period. I've had issues more than twice.If you've read this far, mark this comment as 'Helpful' so other people see it too. Good luck."
5,"This is going to be long. So lets go with pros and cons.Pros:Build and Keyboard: I was surprised to see the build was so sturdy given the fact that it's plastic. Coming to the keyboard it is one of the best I've ever used. The blue backlit is looks great(would've preferred for an RGB though).Thermals and Fans :The thermals were quite good for a laptop around 60k and the fan sound was barely audible even in performance mode.The laptop does get heated while playing AAA games but nothing much to be worried about.Performance: The AMD Ryzen 5 core works like a charm, it gives intel i7 10th gen a run for its money.The boot up time is around 4-6 sec with the SSD.All the FPS games ran pretty smoothly even with ultra settings.Others: The Lenovo Vantage software is a plus and so is the privacy shutter(which I think every laptop should have by the way)Cons:Display: Nothing great to be excited about here. Both the brightness and color accuracy of the screen are average.Battery: Okay so I see Lenovo changed their stance on battery life from 6.7 hrs to 5 which is more accurate . While gaming the battery lasted for about 90 min.During normal usage it lasts for 3.5 - 4 hrs, although it did last for 5 hrs when the settings were under Quiet mode.Speakers: The speakers were okay and I expected nothing more from a laptop of this price range(I mostly use headphones anyway).So to conclude this just might be one of the best gaming laptop under 65k if not the best and you could totally go for it."
4,"First of all, an epic laptop. Comes with all specs i require. I am not so much into gaming and the processor is fabulous. Comes with a superb quality display and a cool looking blue backlight. Its fast afüî•. It runs like butter. Overall not so much for gaming. If you're considering for gaming, you should go with the 1660ti version. But met my requirements.A bit cons --The body is a magnet to fingerprints, need to regularly clean with a cloth.-Weight is a bit more-60 hertz only if you're here for gaming. For me this is no issue.Conclusion- You should definitely consider buying, I didn't trust Lenovo lately but its value for money üëç"
4,"First I appreciate the delivery by Amazon as promised timeline even during this covid situation.Below is my Lenovo IdeaPad gaming 3 config,AMD Ryzen 5 4600h, 512 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram, 120HZ, Nvidia GTX 1650.Model.no: 82EY00UAIN1. Full HD display is really good at this price.2. Build quality is good and the structure is simply the best.3. Keypad, trackpad and backlight are very nice.4. The laptop boots up with in 5 sec, it's awesome.Everything is perfect except the below 2 items,1. Battery is draining little faster for normal usuage itself.2. Audio speaker is not as good as  expected.In a nutshell I would say this is a very good budget gaming laptop if you are looking around 60k."
5,"Lenovo ideapad gaming 3 120Hz- I used this about 10 days. I am sharing my 10 days experiance with this system.1.BULID QUALITY: Screen side body is bulid by somekind of Fiber which is very stiff and the lower body is bulid by plastic but it feels like a premium. Laptop design is ultimate.For Bulid quality and design it can get 5/5 definitly.2. CAMERA: One grate thing about camera is they give Privacy shutter feature through which u can lock your camera. A good camera security feature.Camera quality is not good.It's worst. It gives too much pixalated images.You can record video upto 720p 30fps. It is better to purchase external camera if you are a creator/Live streamer.3. KEYBOARD: It is full size keyboard. Key design and the quality is awesome. This keyboard design wil helps to comfort and accurate typing. Key movement is also good. It has two modes of backlight(BLUE color). The blue colored key light feels like premium. One important thing is, You should always take care(clean) of keybord, Any dust and stones kind of small particles will easely enter below the keys and may cause problems when typing. Always clean keyboard before using it.4. BATTERY: Battery life is decent. For me It gives almost 6hrs to 6.5hrs in 'bettter performance' mode where I done coding and MS word kind of things which doesn't need much CPU power.5. DISPLAY: 15.6"" 120Hz Full HD IPS anti-glare display gives Very smooth video experiance. Plays 4k videos well. Viewing angle is also good.6.AUDIO QUALITY: It comes with Dolby Atmos Stereo speaker. Sound is loud and clear(i don't felt any kind of noise from the speakers). It is more than enough.7. STORAGE: It comes with 512GB SSD.There is a dedicated HDD slot,We can insert 1 TB of HDD along with this 512GB SSD there.8. PERFORMANCE: I have not tested any game,it may works fine. Gives awesome performance for office work and multitasking. If video editing concerned, Try to buy 16GB RAM varient or upgrade this system to 16GB, So that you can get better performance(working fine in 8GB also).CONCLUSION: Under 60-63k,It's realy worth and value for money.Best video and audio experiance, grate performance."
5,Above expectations.
5,"Just got it about 10 days ago. So can't give a proper review as such. So this is not a long term usage review.Pros:-Consistently string performance-No heating at all-Good anti glare-Not as heavy as i thought it would beBuild though plastic, is quite sturdy. If don't believe that metal is always the best solution. Considering the weight, kind of laptop etc.-Amazing keyboard. It's well thought out and has a good feel, and didn't experience any flexing.-Keyboard with 2 levels of back light. Make it clear in the darkest of environments.Cons: Not many-Average battery life.-Color accuracy of the screen is poor. It's fine for someone like me but do consider this when buying-Web cam is below average."
5,"for the price , it delivers  quality performance. Worth buying!"
5,It's a fantastic beast man. Just go for it. Best value for money. One of the best in this price range. Before buying I just worried about Lenovo' s build quality. But in this case Lenovo proven me wrong. The build quality is good and gives premium look. Hardware wise there is nothing new to say. But the package is good for this price range. Battery life is good while playing movies/ streaming online can run till 4 to 5 hours. While programming it can hold upto 3 to 4 hrs. I didn't tried on gaming. However this is ok for the given hardware.
3,"Yes, you read the headline right. If any of that is not your priority, you may go ahead with the laptop. It's a good laptop, don't get me wrong, but1. if you're expecting the advertised battery performance, then you will be disappointed - immensely. I get at most an hour, which to my requirement is good enough. I always look for power source nearby, and if there is none, I try to limit my electronic (phone, laptops etc) usage. It's all right with me, but maybe not with you.2. if you're expecting a ""premium"" support, as advertised, then you will be disappointed again. Exactly the day AFTER my return window with Amazon ended, I found out that the number 5 on the right-side number pad gets stuck. ONE day! A conglomerate like Amazon should be in a place to make exceptions, but it's all right, I was still within Lenovo's warranty,  and because of that, I was asked by the Amazon representative to contact them - and I did. By bad support, I am not talking about the support I got from Amazon - this guy was just following standard protocol - it's Lenovo's! The same day, I raised a ticket with them, and it's been a week now, and I haven't gotten ANY call/email/message from them. Now I hear you ask, ""But doood. If you haven't gotten any email or message, the complaint wouldn't have gone through or registered"", to which I say, I see the ticket number when I go to the Lenovo portal, and it's in ""Investigating"" status (or something like that). You get the point. ONE WEEK of premium support (or lack thereof)!**UPDATE** - Lenovo finally acknowledged the request and some 8 - 9 tos-and-fros later, agreed to send a technician, who found out the issue is real and agreed for a replacement (Obviously it wasn't all this simple - this whole process took him about 2 hours). FYI, as on this writing, the replacement is yet to arrive (and the laptop is sealed in a Lenovo branded cover with its carton box - post Covid-19 procedure I suppose - and is in my custody). And that's 2 days without laptop- Just saying :/3. if you expect to play a lot of newer games - I haven't tried this personally, and I bought this laptop not (entirely) for gaming (although I had installed CoD Ghosts (I know it's an old game), and after like an hour into the game, it glitched on me once - at a place when there was a huge explosion, maybe the graphics card couldn't process that much info) but I must say it's been a good performer. I ran my DL (deep learning) model with over 1 crore rows, and about 17 columns and it performed better than my work laptop, which has (only) a 16 gb RAM, no external graphic card. I will upgrade the RAM on this to 16 (it's 8*1 now and I will add another equivalent 8 (3200/CL-22)) and see how it goes, but all that after I get the issue at hand sorted out.BTW, the reason I realized my keyboard had an issue late was because I use a Bluetooth keyboard and the only time I used its own keyboard was in its first day, and somehow I forgot to test the keyboard.FYI, it's a fingerprint magnet."
5,"REVIEW AFTER 10 DAYS OF USEI have been using this for last 10 days and this was awesome...got this after 2 days of order.PACKAGE:the packaging were good and they used some decent foam for support.BUILD QUALITY:the build quality was qutie good for this price range..it feels light enough for a gaming laptop..KEYBOARD/TRACKPAD:i really loved the keyboard and i really had good typing experience...for the trackpad it was good...and i mostly use external mouse...but the trackpad was fine..DISPLAY:the one downside is the display...i wont say it is the worst...but could be better...if u want to get better colour quality u can get a external monitor or get another system...but in this price range it is quite common..SPECS:for the specs its awesome...for around 60k u get a 6 core cpu 4600h wi=hich is amazing in long run..it has a dedicated gpu 1650 which is awesome..the ram is acceptable...quite common in this range...but can be easily upgraded to 16gb by adding a single 8gb stick..the m.2 ssd is nice gives a read speed of around 1700 which is awesome for laptops in this range..and also u can add additional hdd..i added a 512gb hdd and it works fine..PERFORMANCE:I installed premiere pro and photoshop and it was working perfect....i didnt overclock the system but i know it will do really good..i didnt try any games till now but will update in future but i am sure this can run most games in medium/high settings and get 60fps..TEMPS:for the temps it stays quite and in control while doing programming but can get little hot while doing some serious editing which is quite common..as it takes lots of cpu and gpu usage..OVERALL:i would definitely recommend this laptop.if u want a laptop for programming,editting,gaming this is the best choice for this price range...battery is average can get some 4hrs avg while using vs code and chrome...and 2-3 hours during editting..i would reccomend to upgrade the ram as soon as possible to get more perfomance outtaa this..if u want to get a more of a gaming laptop this is a OK choice as it has only 1650 and the display can hit u if u want good color precision...which can surely be eliminated by getting a good external display...i would give it a 8/10(as i didnt try any games on this deivce)will be updating more details after trying out new games and apps..make sure to give a thumbs up if u think this review helped u so that others can benefit from thisthanks :)"
2,Worst exhaust placement .burns linke hell when you place on lap.dont buy if you ant to use it on lap. Heavy as hell as well.
1,"Works just like a laptop without a GPU or I should say it's worst than it. Blender crashes everytime I render a very simple image without any texture.Charge lasts for an hour max. If you are working, you should always have the charger plugged in.The Sound is feeble. This one is not for listening to music or watching movies.It's a useless laptop for the price. I doubt the specs mentioned in the description are actually part of this model.If you are looking for a laptop for creative purpose or any other general use, please avoid this one. Don't go by the positive reviews."
5,"First thing , I am a college student and I am a Graphic Designer . Yaah.....I know this  laptop is not good for photo and video editing but if u r tight with the pocket you have to stick with this price range .1. Hand adjustment over this laptop is so comfy and smooth. It feels better than using a external keyboard.The curve in the keys makes the typing experince for you perfect .2.I don't play any kind of games .The task I will be using this beast is for photoshop and illustrator. And let me tell you something , ryzen 5 4600H is doing it's part of the job perfectly . This laptop has 8 GB ram which is good if u r only running a single software like photoshop. But , when I am using illustrator and photoshop together , i can see a small amount of lag, which you can solve by installing a one more 8GB ram stick. This will make you exprience smooth .3. I don't like those laptops which have a gaming look on their top ,I always go with a laptop which has a simpke and clean look and this guy is perfectly fits with my chiice . It just has a name lenovo on it and that's all rest is completely clean .4. The single blue light is really good with three levels of brigthness.This is best for you if you don't prefer a RGB light.5. I am a bit unsatisfied with the storage because this guy completely use it's 512GB SSD in C drive . I will buy a 1TB external HDD next month. You can install a 1TB HDD inside the laptop . You have this option.6. I got this buddy at 55k in Amazon great festival. If you r going with HP Victus of same specs , I would say you can save some money by sticking with this guy.7. There is one thing more , I would like to say about the speakers sound quality .Most of the youtubers are saying that the sound quality is not that good. But, I didn't felt any issue there. I speakers are loud enough that you can enjoy a movie with your bunch of idiot friends.8. The only point which is taking this guy overall performance down in front of me is that I can comfortably view things at minimum 75% brightness. Below that , it kind of start to become difficult.And more the brightness more the  battery drop, so if you come from a place where electricity is not that good, keep this thing in mind.7. In short, this guy stands on most of my needs and it doesn't give a hard time to my pocket."
5,Nice gaming laptop. Superb build quality.Battery drains fast. Sound can be a bit louder. Great display.Cost me 60k for r5 4600/8gb/512gb ssd/120hz / 4gb nvidia 1650.
5,Absolutely brilliant laptop  well designed well graphics best for coding but slightly weighty . Overall a beast .
5,"Its nice. Before you can buy it, there are couple of things you should remember.1. Its very heavy, it may not seem a big deal, but it will be soon enough.2. The plastic body seems vulnerable,so you may want to get ADP from lenovo3. I get around 5 hrs battery life with power saver and other battery savings methods. Other than these, i am satisfied with this purchase"
5,"G3 comes in a lot of variants, i got it with 8GB ram and 512 SSD. The factory SSD is intel and speeds only upto 1200 MB/S. I upgraded it to 970 EVO Plus and extra 8GB ram. The machine is pushed to its max. Battery backup is upto 5 hrs for movie watching. And stays for 10 hrs with screen off. This will suit mid gamers with a decent config"
4,Brilliant product. But one issue that I have is that the wifi driver stops working when you switch on when laptop is plugged in. Also battery backup is not up to mark but device has conservative mode charging so can't complain about battery backup. Really great for the discount I got on it. PS - I got a 1TB HDD upgrade kit for FREE
5,The laptop is totally value for money. The build quality and keyboard are some of the main difference in comparison to same range laptops.Without high ram usage it can easily last above 6 hrs of battery life.It's a beast in its price range.
4,Laptop's trackpad stopped working after 10 days and camera was defective. Since Amazon gives only 7 days. The return window waa closed for me. So contacted lenovo care and they sent parts and technician. He fixed it and now all smooth and nice. It's comes with damage warranty too plus you get premium Lenovo care for 1 year by default. Don't think tok much go for it.
5,"-For student it will be really help .-its for casual gamers and and student who are in engineering and Designing .-U can easily use software like Autocad , inventor , ANSYS ,CREO etc .-Don't worry about the Screen quality ,If you are new laptop user or you from middle class family  its just go for it.- Lenovo is trusted brand i use Lenovo all in one pc from last 6 year and still."
5,For gaming it's awesome. 50-60 fps for Valhalla have not tried other games yet but it's so smooth. Display is 120hz and it look so good. Battery life is 1-2 hr for continually gaming and 4-6 hr for normal usage. Loved it‚ù§Ô∏è
3,"Laptop performance is good so far, but the battery performance disappointed me, if u are into games don't buy this coz the battery lasts for only 30mins if u play any games.. Speaker volume is very low. It doesn't come with free office suite and anti virus, apart from these, laptop performance is gud.. Booting is fast and I didn't see any lagging if I run multiple applications.. Display is also amazing"
5,"Liked the product , performence is Excellent , display is good for beginner buyer or normal and gaming usage , battery is average got 3 1/2 to 4 at quiet mode and in balanced it's 2 1/2 to 3 hour , build quality is good"
5,"Best in class laptop in this budget ...don't hesitate , i have search info on laptop for 1 month and finall found this lenovo ideapad gaming 3 the best one in such price..go buy it!!"
4,Battery life is good . Nice thermals . No heat under normal usages and light gaming. Keyboard is better. Boots less than 10 seconds.
1,"I am really very disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è.With in a month this laptop is making a lot nonsense things.To much heating.Getting hang all the time.Although it has i5 generation,but. It work like less  then i3.pls don't buy this I have made a mistake of buying this."
4,Best Laptop under 50K Intel i5 8th Gen + MX230 Dedicated Graphics Card
4,"Performance as expected of a Intel Core i5 8th Gen. system. System's full performance is limited by the HDD storage, if you want to utilize its maximum performance it must be upgraded with the M.2 NVME SSD Storage. Just add a 256 GB NVME SSD and transfer the OS to the SSD and it should work like a charm.I am trying to change this laptop as this one has only one negative point for me, i didn't had any idea that the heat dissipation vent is directed towards lower surface. Limiting it to only hard surfaces, and not on lap or any kind of cloth. If you do, it overheats to the point you are all sweaty over the area. While playing PUBG Lite, systems panel above keyboard got too much heated. viewing angles are not too great and screen has kind of a warmer tone.if heating is not an issue you can go for it."
5,It's a beast product.... The negative ratings are I think paid ones.... Mine is awesome.. Only one thing missing is dvd drive.. Otherwise everything is cool.
4,Speakers are badNo USB type C portWobbly keyboard not backlightPoor viewing angles.on screenOther things are good
5,"I bought for 42.9k .Great texture, touch and fell of body, u'll never regret reg.Touch pad is good a little bigger is appreciable.Keyboard is ok.Performance is good after updating on 2nd day,I never feel any lag till now.Usb ports are 3-4 if I remember.Wifi connectivity is great for even far routers...But display angles are bad . Not good for great movie experience or gaming...Sound is ok and loud enough ...Delivery and packing is ok...Battery life is around 4 hrs.8gb ram1tb hdd1080p displayLan connection port2gb graphic cardi5 windows 10 pre installedMake sure from reputed seller to get good piece  coz it only matters...Go for it undoubtedly in this price range in the market..."
4,"Liked:1. Looks slim and good2. Performs wellDisliked :1. Overpriced2. Poor battery backup3. IPS display4. Sound5. KeyboardOverall, Not recommended unless you have a specific requirement of such configuration and the same brand."
4,I have been using this since 4 days so my review after 4 days is it takes really long time to start. I tried pubg pc lite and was getting 100+ fps at high setting while charger plugged in so it is good for casual gaming. It heats up while playing pubg lite.
5,"As displayed in picture, product was received on time. Till now working fine.No issues has been encountered with machine"
2,i am using this laptop for online classes zoom but the laptop is heating up and hanging like voice and video breaking and i didn't do any gaming. i am raising complaint for customer care. customer care also tried one time but problem persisting.after reinstalling os again issue arised. after two days problem is not there. as the vents are down only computer is heating up no side vents available
1,"I ended up returning the item as even the replacement that was sent had the same defect as the one that was sent originally. There was a gap between the screen and the plastic bezel around the screen. It was a manufacturing defect.Whatever minimal usage I did, the 2 things that stood out were the loudness of the fan and the glare of the screen.Full marks to Amazon and the seller though on how they handled the issue and for refunding the money."
5,This laptop is best in segment.. good for coding stuff. Go for it
3,"this laptop is good for only basic purpose(Like internet,any type of ms operation,study and many others).display is not good.sound is too less.connectivity is fast(like wifi,bluetooth).overall this is a good laptop for students and official workers in less budget."
5,This piece is a beauty.... The operating speed was enhanced when I added an SSD only after that it became a bliss to use!!! I recommend using 240 GB SSD drive.
4,Good value for money. Would have given 5 stars if the  laptop had an LED to indicate hard disk activity. Built-in speakers give out a decent volume and sound quality. Windws 10 is better than Windows 8.1 which I had on my previous (HP) laptop. I hope Windows 10 updates do not spoil its performance.
3,"I am using this laptop from almost 2 years. In first year, everything was great. I played games on this, worked hours on this continuously, watched movies etc. But in the past six months, its battery started to get wear. Even though i am not using it continuously, its battery still get discharged quickly and now the game also started to hang (Even using graphic card). It did not live up to its 38k cost."
2,"PURCHASED ON MARCH 2020, SELLER OFFERS ONE YEAR WARRANTY. BUT IN ACER WEBSITE SHOWING WARRANTY ONLY UP TO AUG 2020. SO NO ELIGIBLE FOR PURCHASE EXTENDED WARRANTY FROM ACER OFFICIAL WEBSITE. NEED HELP"
5,the product is as expected. without any physical scratch. no problem with system and software as well. as expected from Appario Retail Private Ltd.
4,Some battery backup problem . Battery not working more than half an  hour without charging. And operating system version is old . Some hanging problem when we open some more URL in browser. Rest of all is okay . Please work on these issues.  Thanks
4,"My lappy is not even getting on within 1 week use only but after replacement it's being nice experience of using this,,,,damn good speaker quality with 4-5 hr avg battery lifeüëçüëç"
4,"Very nice laptop . U can also play some games on it . I have been playing Fortnite on this laptop with 60fps . If your budget is less than 50,000 then go for this laptop ."
1,There are hardware issues it seems. The wifi stops working abruptly and starts working abruptly.The inbuilt speakers output is so low that I am always using headphones or external speakers.The screen view is bad from even small angles
4,Battery backup is not good.Otherwiae overall this product is great in accordance to his price. Rs:-36001/- exclusive GST
2,"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH THE LAPTOP! POOR BUILD, POOR QUALITY, POOR DISPLAY, POOR SOUND, POOR PERFORMANCE!DO NOT BUY ANY ACER LAPTOP. (UNLESS YOU WISH TO KEEP VISIT SERVICE CENTERS SOON)"
5,Nice laptopGo for it
1,Battery backup is Very Bad . Not more than 2 hrs.Very Disappointed
5,It is quick and stable. Perfect for my home office needs
1,"Not one year completed..Adapter gone,battery gone..Tell me what to do with this Laptop..No clue what to do with it.."
5,"Not waste your money,gaming and screen quality also very good"
4,GOOD AND FAST
5,Best laptop in this budget. Don't think twice
5,Good laptop in this price range.
1,DOnt buy. stopped charging of 3 months
5,Like
1,"Pathetic, pls don't go for it, no return pilicy available wd this product.No free MS office, only a 1 month trial version loaded which is slow too"
1,"Worst product from dell and worst customer support of Amazon... Have lost trust on this company... Within 2 days of delivery.. The system is not working properly.. Its taking more than 20 mins to open Google chrome from start... And I am being told by Amazon team that its driver issue and I need to update drivers... How will one reach dell website when the Web browser is taking 20-25mins to open... And now amazon tells me that neither I can replace or return until and unless their technician looks into it, tries to resolve it and post that they will look into the matter to see what can be done...."
1,New laptop since one week freezes during basic stuff.  Reinstalled OS three times. Tried all steps given by Dell. Extremely slow and sluggish.Dell giving all useless solutions.
1,Worst product from dell which is very slow and ms office is an trial  version  bad product and bad service and after sale service from Amazon Amazon cheats customers like this type of product
4,HiProduct received on time but one thing was the MS Office was given only for 1 month on trial basis after that need to purchase. it's not mentioned anywhere in laptop details.
5,"Excellent laptop. Sturdy, with lifetime Windows and MS Office, is value for money. I got it with exchange of my Lenovo's I-3 (purchased in 2012) 15.5"" laptop. That was also working but with Windows 7 so I changed it. I am fully satisfied with Dell Inspiron 3493, mainly it has preloaded Windows 10 as well as MS office."
1,"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT...In the era of 2020, it works with pace of computers of 1990s. Really upset with the performance of the Laptop. Though some pluses are there... Comes with inbuilt Windows 10 & Office 2019 but can‚Äôt use these to their optimum due to poor processor speed.. Display is pathetic... Even Alphabets break leave alone Photos and Videos... Something seriously wrong with Dell..."
4,As described :1. Windows 10 home : preloaded and pre-activated2. MS Office is 30 days trial only. One need to activate it manually. Afterwards it will be activated and licensed lifetime.3. McAfee antivirus is also licensed valid for 15 months.Outer body is of silver colour.Keyboard and screen border is of black colour.Keyboard keys are soft.Touch pad is also good.Weight is bit high.Sound quality is good.Display is normal HD so don't expect Full HDOverall good product in this price.
5,Awsome Product ....All is good
1,The laptop showed a blank screen and cursor when turned on. Seems to be a defective product. Amazon call centre is not agreeing for a return.
1,"The product is worst. Looks like they are selling defective products by making sure customer neither can refund nor can replace. The laptop I received has seroius performance problems(just browsing for 2 hrs gets hanged and have to forcefully reboot), when contacted Amazon customer care they send a person for inspection who either  doesn't have knowledge/ they just visit and favour amazon as they are getting paid by Amazon I think.Now have to spend hours and hours with dell customer care to make it correct, that to not sure if this would work or not."
1,The laptop is SUPER SLOW even for checking emails and working on Microsoft Word. I submitted the laptop to Dell Service Center within a month for the issue of slow speed and hanging issue and I was told that they will have to change the Motherboard of the Laptop. Even after a month of submission the motherboard is not available and the laptop is lying at the service center. I was informed by the senior manager of the service center that this particular model will not perform well until I get an addition 120 GB SSD installed additionally.I will never recommend a Dell Laptop
1,"I received defective product where some keys were not working and screen was blinking. As per the promise of Amazon for free replacement, no replacement was done. I sent it back to Amazon, it was received on 24th November by Amazon but till date i.e. 22nd December, I have been calling for refund. But over a month no refund has been made. Its ridiculous. I would suggest not to buy this kind of products."
1,"DONT BUY THIS PRODUCTAFTER RECEIVING THE LAPTOP WE START USINGBTHIS LAPTOP BUT IT WAS HANGING OPEN WHITE WINDOWS.WE HAVE CONTACTED DELL CUSTOMER CARE EXECUTIVE AND INFORMED THE SAME THEY TOLD THAT PLEAAE UPDATE ALL THE DRIVERS. WE HAVE FACED SAME PROBLEM. WE HAVE PURCHASED FOR MY SONE ONLINE CLASSES. NOT A SINGLE DAY HE HAS USED THIS LAPTOP. TODAY I HAVE DELL CALLED CUSTOMER CARE EXECUTIVE THEY TOLD US THAT ISSUE IS WITH LOW CAPACITY RAM FOR WINDOW 10 WHICH DOES NOT SUPPORT.WE HAVE ASKED DELL CUSTOMER CARE EXECUTIVE WHY YOU HAVE DESIGNED SUCH AN ITEM WITH NO COMPATIBILITY OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE.NOW DELL SUGGESTED US TO INCREASE THE RAM AT MY COST.REQUEST ALL OF YOU PLEASE DONT BUY SUCH WORST PRODUCT EVER. DELL CUSTOMER CARE EXECUTIVE SPEAKING LIKE ""TRAINED POPPET"".SUGGEST ALL OF YOU DONT BUY DELL PRODUCTS"
3,"Lookwise it was good, but when I talk about performance I am little bit disappointed as the bettery backup is not as mentioned after full charge it only run 4-5 hour & in starting you find the processor is slow. So if u want to buy laptop this is not as good as we think it."
4,"I do like Dell's laptop, before also purchased. Build quality, color, memory is good, but I feel performance is little low. I recommend this product.I'm sharing some buying tips, NEVER go for No Cost EMI option, there is hidden interest charges which you never been informed while purchasing. The word is ""No Cost"" but no, when you receive EMI statement from Bank you get to know extra cost applied. I fall in this situation, so take my advice."
5,It is of very good quality Dell I3 is best for students use both for college and school it's fast not that super fast either according to your want you can buy i3 or i7 but this laptop is giving excellent service and it includes everything Ms word according to your convinence you can install it's not free it's included in the laptop though so you can subscribe for later use üê±
5,Worth buying as long as u know how to operate on Windows 10 and you should always vigilant for the windows updates & dell support assist notifications..if u will pay due attention to it you will have most pleasing experience to use this new generation laptop...price wise I still feel that it is on higher side due pandemic and demand due to online classes and work from home ..in normal course this could have Been cost you around 28k-30k.
1,I purchased this laptop in oct 2020. It is a 4 gb ram hdd drive laptop. In all these months i understood that a windows 10 OS will require 4gb of ram to run. So any other application u open like browser or be it anything the lPrimary memory becomes full and it will start fetching memory from hdd. This will kead to long waiits like 5 min for chrome to open up. Solution is to either upgrade to 8gb ram cost around 1.5k and/or get a ssd harddisk atleast 250gb cost around 3.5k.Atleast for me the issue was resolved after getting the ram upgraded. But if u want to use the processor capacity to the max have ssd also apart from ram upgrade.Ideally dell should not be selling this since they are aware that a 4gb ram with windows 10 and without ssd is like a person in coma. All vitals are good but the person cannot perform anything.
3,"I am reviewing the laptop (Dell i3 10th Gen) after about a month's usage. This definitely isnt one for IT professionals or professionals dependant on software. The speed of processor is slow, takes abt 15-20 secs time to open a file or app. Switching from one window to another, also requires patience. As for battery life, if u have charged it fully, the laptop runs for 3.30-4 hrs without dying down. The exterior body of the laptop looks great but key settings may have been more modern.Overall, if u are a student or use more of word doc and less of internet, then this is a fine product. Else, spend a little extra and buy i5 or i7 processor."
1,REPLACE MY LAPTOP. SOME ISSUES WITH THE DISPLAY.WHILE BROWSING ONLINE IN ANY WEBSITE THE DISPLAY GOES BLANK.DARK DISPLAY FOR SOMETIME.CHECKED THE SLEEP MODE ALSO . INCREASE IT TO 10MINS .STILL NOT SUCCESSFUL.PLS REPLACED IT
1,"This is one of the worst product being supplied by Amazon.This laptop takes 15 minutes to boot up, 10 minutes to open chrome.. I can go on..Showing lesser price on amazon. Now I understood why it was showing lesser price.I want to return this but my window for return is over.So now I have see this useless thing daily without using it.Please it's a scam of dell with amazon included in itDo not buy itThank you"
1,"Bought two Dell Inspiron laptops in August 2020. Both the laptops had problems within the first week with slow response. Now two months down, the screen freezes constantly making it impossible to work. Since both the laptops are exhibiting the same problems this seems to be an inherent issue."
5,Order was delivered on time good performance
1,"It is dead slow, booting taking 10 mins, for opening a folder also it take time and keep on hanging. I am working with Excel and browser when i switch windows it strucks , Even Govt Free laptop works faster then this, This is worst model of dell, it looks Amazon also tied with this worst model , now I feel why exchanged my old laptop it was faster 10 times compare with this muck Laptop"
3,Please note a per Dell support team there is no LED indicator light on the power on switch which allows one to understand Power ON state of the laptop. There no proper clarity given in product details. The Laptop is very slow. Be careful if you intend to purchase. This product is not even average.
4,As described :1. Windows 10 home : preloaded and pre-activated2. MS Office is 30 days trial only. One need to activate it manually. Afterwards it will be activated and licensed lifetime.3.

1,"This laptop is too too slow. It takes about 5 minutes to open a simple 1-2 mb pdf file. Contacted Dell Customer Care, they advised me to install addtional RAM and SSD ! Why are they selling such a useless laptop? For selling additional accessories?? This laptop can't work with its factory installed hardware ! You will have to instalp additional RAM and SSD !"
1,"I have purchased it for my office use which includes just outlook and 2-3 excel spreadsheet.  But even it consists of 4gb ram,  it is too slow. Takes very long time to start, and gets hanged very frequently.  Processor speed of 1.2 ghz don't support windows 10. At least 2ghz is required for windows 10. So in nutshell,  it's waste of money ."
1,Friends i want to let you know that don't purchase this product as the performance is extremely slow. To open any application it takes 1 minute to open and 90% it will stuck. The speed is like i am using Intel Pentium iv processor. In Google Chrome i browsed YouTube and you will be shocked to know music starts first and after 30 second video play and extreme lagging.
2,"Just a vostro laptop in 14', only top and bottom skin is changed to silver.Very slow, getting hang even in opening a website,Good thing is it has MS Office. And display is good.In Dell website only 15' available with i3 and that is votro only no inspiron. Inspiron are only available with i5 nad i7. So i3 Inspiron is low grade vostro for online sale only.But overall, very poor performance, too slow."
1,Dear viewers please don't buy this system I am suffering from performance issue. When ever i am trying to open system it is taking 1 minutes to open a windows and the system always slow and I am not even work properly with this system I am trying to get support fro. Amazon and dell no response  now I am suffering a lot hence please stay away from this product.
1,"Friends, this laptop is dead slow. Just to load windows and start, it takes minutes together.I would have returned it but I could not use it due to Diwali festival season and by the time I realized the fault, the return period was over. Don't buy this at all from Dell, go for a better one which would cost around 40K."
1,"Whenever I order the product, I was very excited to unbox the new product with high configuration.I received the product on 3rd day and packing was normal. I unbox the product and setup all the thing.Its working fine and running smoothly as per the expectation but on 3rd day suddenly I got lines on the screen.I was worried about that and so that raise the request for replacement and after many follow-up the product was picked up after 9 days (don't know what was the issue but every executive replying with the different statement) and got the new product after 4th day of pickup.After Replacement:I receive the replaced product and check all the configuration of the product.Packing was good. I unbox the product and setup all the necessary thing.music was playing on the system and screen was off because of time out.I clicked on the mouse button to wake the screen but system does wakeup and start doing the beep type sound like ""trrrrrrrrrrrrrr unnununununu"".I wait some time for restart but it beeping continuously and then I shutdown by pressing the power button.I turn on the system and I was getting start blue Screen Error (BSOD) continuously.I tried many thing to restore the windows but nothing was working then i choose the last option to reset the windows. but after the windows resetting. I lost many necessary applications like Microsoft Store, Mail box and many more.After that I Install the fresh windows by format all drives and setup again all necessary thing.acer didn't provide recovery drive so that you can reinstall the OEM version again if anything happen.we know that the product key was installed in the BIOS so that every use can install windows many times and copy of the windows will be activated and became genuine.But its not the OEM modified version. It will be the normal version released by the Microsoft. Acer needs to provide the recovery drive.This is a gaming laptop with the most high configuration of this series. This expectation will not be considerable by any user. Manufacture need to focus to fix this type of issues."
1,"Worst purchase ever, don't purchase this laptop.when u call to acer support they will tell u why you purchase laptop from Amazon or Flipkart and not have service center and mostly mentioned center are closed.on acer website laptop extended warranty cost you 2000 rupees and if u purchase it from Amazon u need to visit service center and they ask me 15000 for same warrenty.acer support team is not working and their support website is mostly all time down.i even attached screenshot what I got.dont purchase acer laptop ever.it will spoil your time.they tell u to register within 7 days of laptop purchase but website will down for 15 days and no any response from support team."
5,"Very nice preforming gaming laptop, no heating issue, value for money, best for coding, storage options are very good."
3,The laptop is gr8 ..overheating issues but nothing to worry about.....the battery is horrible tho
5,"As per specifications it's a great deal & value for money. I got it for 75k with exchange offer.It's build quality is NOT top notch like any other gaming laptop but it's good for this price.As for playing games yes I have been playing with AC power supply cause battery drains fast.screen quality is good also for gamers but not for designers who want the most detailed coloring.Two fan design is great as it's cooling the cpu and GPU very fast, But if they are on max it's sounds like a Jet engine.Overall it's a great buying option for who want play games and use heavy softwares,Its work fast.I recommend it for this price range upto 85kDo buy it when it on sale, as per original price build quality is not so great."
5,"Im a student and convincing dad to buy me a laptop ( gaming laptop ) in range of price more then 80k was not at all possible ,,,so getting this through all these offers is worth it ,,, buy it definetly if you are getring this under 80k or even around 80k ,,,,but if getting above 85k ,,,i might suggest go for asus tuf(i7 11th gen , 16gb ram, 1TB ssd , wirh webcam and number pad)"
5,I like the display quality best for gaming and work best I mainly like the keyboard RGB light EXELLENT LAPTOP NEVER SEEN VERY FAST DELIVERY WITHOUT A SCRATCH
1,Its performance is reduced after 3 weeks .Company is not accepting to change .
5,Super product
1,"Don't fall for it's specifications, it has the lowest benchmark compare to other i7 11800h laptop. Acer just fooling people with such spec. Also the screen quality is pathetic it's not 300 nits brightness as they claim. Speaker is horrible. Battery life and sound quality is average as an gaming laptop.....Biggest drawback it's proccessor power :("
2,"Worst Battery lifeScreen Quality is bad. My previous lenovo ideapad C340 laptop has better screen quality than this. Colours are just dull. you wont enjoy watching movies/series on this laptop.Not portable. Its very heavy.It charges very slow. My previous 30k laptop used to charge around more than 50%-60% in 40-45 minutes.Even doing the simple tasks like working on word or excel consumes lot of battery.After full charge, it on screen time is not more than 3 hours which is really bad.DONOT  GO FOR IT..! I tried to return it but amazon ditched me and didn't care if i am satisfied with the product or not and didnt refund my amount."
5,Really excellent laptop I like this laptop I play games like free fire and bgmi this is best gaming laptop I like please buy this also ok! Bye
5,I bought acer nitro 5 1 month ago...I wanted RTX 3060TI  BUT IT WASNT THERE so I bought RTX 1650 Ti  and this one made me soo jealous can I get a exchange (üòÇ)  ....I recommend u buy this laptop
2,CS GO FPS drops in game.Body and Keyboard - Poor build qualityMediocre CameraAudio in 3.5mm jack issue - headphones go undetected in game
3,I had a nitro 5...  I didn't know before i purchased one... that the CPU frequency drops to 1.5 Ghz if its on battery.... you will 2.5 Ghz only when its on power. It is set at bios level so you cannot change that at all...
5,"Perfect laptop for gaming, what an amazing accessories combination... Must buy!Perfect for gaming...awesome...GTX 3050 TIAlso It's not that costly"
5,Is the graphic card present here of 8gb or 4gb?In description it's mentioned as 8gb of Nvidia RTX 3050
1,"The laptop is great and all, I got it today but the specification or discrption that shown or given is AMD Radeon vega 8 Graphic. I checked the settings and shows only AMD Radeon (TM) Graphics!. Is this ok?"
5,Awesome product from hpindia..I satisfied with this laptop...TBH what i wanted that i got..i got this with amazing deal..‚Ä¢Laptop is basically good for regular users like for office works..‚Ä¢Definately this laptop is for students choice...‚Ä¢I needed this specified laptop for learn hacking and coding...‚Ä¢Battery life isn't as much as likeable...‚Ä¢Charges fastely but also it drains too soon ..‚Ä¢Good choice for Students basically..‚Ä¢With AMD Processor it runs very cool and smoothly..‚Ä¢Nice graphics for low end gamers ...‚Ä¢I played pubg on this laptop it gave me a good performance backup...‚Ä¢Only issue is the price..! If you r a low budget guy (Multitasking and gaming purpose) this selection is affordable...But if price drops down only! like i got this deal in 45k but than i thought i didn't get a perfect deal with price$My free advice is if you get this product under 42-44k(maxi..) don't miss this opportunity.Thankyou..
5,I bought this laptop for study purpose. It has been a week since I am using this and it is running smooth.Battery life: 4-5 hours(approx)Overall a good laptop in this price range.
5,"Terrific purchase during festival sale @39k with card offers.Ryzen 5 is way better than i3 11 or 10 gen. Got 8 gb ram, dedicated graphics card, ssd storage, Fhd screen, all silver metal body.It looks so so premium product. It is a totally new unused laptop delivered. See pictures for proof. Amazon packing and delivery is top notch. Can't believe got Ryzen 5 at this price. Speed is like a rocket. Speakers are good too but not too loud. Camera is really good."
5,"The Laptop is giving Awesome Performance. I have installed Windows 11 on the day I got this from Amazon. All the Apps are working great.  Even after using heavy software like video editing or graphic designing apps, the system doesn't heat at all. No sound of the fan. Comes with MS office 2019 which is a plus point. Mcafee Antivirus comes along with it. But it's not required as windows have their own windows defender.  Mcafee Makes the system slower I had to remove it. Center alignment of the Taskbar is very helpful. Gives you good performance even if you create more desktops. The only Flaw I found is Windows 11 doesn't show separated windows for the same type of files. It combines them. Which is sometimes irritating. But overall the System is amazing."
1,"Bad product, bottom side rubber feet is already peel out, i don't think we can add additional ssd hdd in this system, overall i am not satisfied."
1,What the hell is happeneing with Amazon dealer sells worst product to the customer and the customer will hate Amazon why can't Amazon check the product first I have received this laptop in morning and in half and hour I see this colour of screnn changes someone times it's not al but someone it's complete whitish screen even I had down the brightness of laptop then also this is happening battery is not good app like coding and programming like virtual box kinux kaali and Ubuntu were getting prblm in installing worst I had taken from HP now this brand is not trusted instead of this go other brand atlst u get good in low price.
5,Best in this price range. Battery backup is around 10 to 12 hrs in normal use like web browsing. 8 to 10 hrs while coding and 6 to 7 hrs while watching YouTube videos. Look wise it feels a premium laptop build quality is also superb. Performance is also top notch because of hexa core processor. Worth buying under 45k because of only 256gb ssd otherwise it is best under 50k.
1,It's not working properly. Bad product I bought this 18 days before I used normally
4,"My opinion after using this laptop for 20 days as follow ;1. Speaker volume is exorbitant. 2. Laptop run about 4 to 5 hrs after full charging. 3. Multitasking is easier in this laptop as it runs smoothly bz of its good processor.4. Built quality of this laptop is slightly poor as compared to other laptops.5. laptop will be much usefull if got an extra M2 slot for extra SSD OR HDD.6. wifi connectivity and bluetooth connectivity is goodOverall to by this laptop is value for money for me as in ""GREAT FESTIVAL SALE''  this laptop is of MRP 42990 and by applying HDFC Debit card offer I got this laptop in Rs 38990 so to buy this laptop is a great deal for me"
5,"Best laptop for computer science students and heavy workloads like AI, MLand deep learning. Its hexacore ryzen 5 processor manages multiple tasks very well and smoothly with a base clock speed of 2.8 .

4,"To begin with, the Intel 11th Gen chips on its 10nm process is the biggest upgrade intel has rocked in more than half a decade. While each generation has a modest 5% improvement over the previous, the 11th Gen. Laptop chips are more to the order of 20% (something for which AMD is to be thanked more than Intel!)This processor is the fastest* you can (currently) have in a laptop (*except the Apple's M1, which is a different beast altogether, if you know what you're dealing with). Even the same generation i7 has such a small margin of improvement over this one, that one might excuse it for being statistically insignificant.Nonetheless, with that settled in, raises the important question:WHY IS THIS LAPTOP SO AWFULLY SLOW?The question is.. very, very valid. Just check the other reviews. This laptop lags more than my 7 year old desktop. And the reason, for the failure of this laptop with TOTL processor & DDR4 memory & latest Xe graphics..No points for guessing, it uses a hard disk. Yes, that thing bottlenecks *so* *bad*. It's awful. It's unusable. While the processor can crunch numbers like Turing's second awakening, the hard disk takes you back to the 20th century. The first day I received it, I was tearing my hair, drank myself to sleep, sobbing over all the decisions I had made in life that led to this moment.But to the rescue comes the most wondrous invention of the 21st century besides TikTok: The NVMe SSD. This butch laptop of ours has an empty M.2 NVMe slot; same as its more expensive variants, just that they come with this slot non-empty. Long story short, I upgraded to an NVMe and installed my OS of choice (hey, Windows folks, that OS will forever be a bottleneck), and this is the fastest PC I've ever laid my hands on. (maybe because I never got hold of an M1 macbook, but nonetheless..)tl;dr: do yourself a favor and upgrade to an NVMe SSD, they're cheap these days. Or spend double the difference to get the upgraded model. In any case, it's literally a millenia of difference. Without it, this shackled beast will only remind you of the good ole' 20th century days."
1,"When I right click, keeps loading, when I try to open task manager it was not responding, when I open windows explorer it was not responding in a minute... Panel is not quality...

5,Excellent product..Superfast..Good for programmers too..For gaming I am not sure but otherwise best laptop in this price range..It's worth every penny..
3,"I bought this laptop during the sale just before Indepedence day sale. I have basic perspectives. My old Asus I3 was over 4 years old and was becoming slow. Coming from IT background, I wanted to purchase a laptop with good RAM, that will help me in my academics and I wanted the laptop to be moderately lighweight having provision for basic gaming. After extensive research through Amazon, finally I narrowed down to this laptop becuase it also had dedicated MX450 graphics on top of Intel Iris Xe dedicated graphics.The laptop worked well as long as basic browsing happened. the moment i started playing the videos, it will heat up, and most importantly, when I started doing light gaming, the laptop will become a baked oven, the fan will stop and boom, it will die. I tried changing settings, modifying power management in Settings, nothing would work.Now by light gaming, I mean ""Tell Me Why"" (2019 game). I do a lot of gaming in my PS4, so I can say with conviction that decision making games like these won't make much use of hardware graphics. I tried Alan Wake from 2011, the result was the same :( Both games were tried through Steam, not pirated ones.Alos, the battery would die in 2.5 - 3 hours on normal use.I called Amazon customer care and this is where they had been trully brilliant. I was initially told that the replacement policy is over by few hours, but they evetually understood my problem and scheduled a technician visit post which, they promised to replace the laptop, through the extended window. the technican delayed the process, again I called up Amazon, this time they went above and beyond and they staright away issued the replacement. Thanks a bunch to Amazon.Once the replacement came, I could see that the power chord was a different one, hence battery management was better. But the laptop heat issue won't go away., while playing games. Hence I had to bring in a laptop cooler to suffice it.Hence, long story cut short - HP has build a product to capture the market well, becuase if you compare with other brands, you won't get a configuration like this, that too with 1.41kg, reminding you that this is not a gaming laptop. But, while doing so, this product has undergone poor testing resulting in not so great quality.Pros:1. Great Display. I like watching movies through VLC, or Netflix /Prime, downlaoded through WQindows App Store.2. Might Sound cliche, but the WIndows 10 is super fast.3. The boot time is between 8-10 secs.4. Comes with Office 2019, just need to activate it.5. I have tried few academics related software and basic video editing, it really works well.6. 16GB RAM is a blessing.7. 2 GB RAM does support basic gaming, at least doing well for my replaced laptop.Cons:1. While playing game, get yourself prepared to face lot of pain. I had repalced my laptop once, and now bought a cooler to suppress the heat while playing. On ""HWMonitor"" software, the average browsing temperature of the laptop is between 55c-60c and while playing game it is between 72c-78c, goving beyond 80c at times. With the cooler on, it is aorund 50c-55c for normal use and browsing, while 65c-70/71c while playing the games which I have mentioned above.2. Sound quality is s big let down.3. HP Service center is poor. I reached out to HP assistant and they told me clearly thats it's a hardware issue, plz ask Amazon to replace it. Also the waiting time during 2AM IST, is about 45 mins. I walked down to a HP store, they took their hands off, stating I am the first customer complaining about this model :D4. Battery backup with the replacement for normal browsing is still around 3.5 hours.As a user, you have 3 choices - 1) if you prefer hardcore gaming, go for gaming laptop. 2) If gaming is not a preference, there is another model that's around 5k less from HP, with just Integratred Intel Iris xe, please go ahead with that. 3) Someone like me, who wants light gaming and general purpose laptop, you may opt out for this as the other brands with same config will cost you 10-15k more ""BUT"" be prepared to face consequences and limitations. Hope this helps :)"
1,"Not worth buying as the battery drains out within 3.30 hours of usage despite the fact that they claim 9 hours of battery usage on the official HP website.The keypad gets heat up immediately after logging in.Display resolution and camera quality are also poor.Facing problem for the replacement of the product regarding the above mentioned issues- not yet replaced, still waiting for replacement. Conversation with amazon is also not satisfactory and is misguiding.Overall product is pathetic, disgusting and is a waste of money. my opinion is not to buy this rubbish product.Got the product replaced. Now performing much better, battery drains out in 6.30 hours as compared to the previous one which drains out in 3.30 hours. Heating up of the laptop body is also reduced significantly."
4,This was a great upgrade from my i3. I7 is a much better and faster processor. Laptop starts on a few seconds. 1 tb ssd snd 16 GB ram is a great combination.It looks beautiful and premium very thin and relatively lightweight.Good combination at this price
5,The best laptop I ever seen. Brightness is very greater than I expected. it gives battery life of 5 hours with is good. It is very very light weight. The best thing is in performance it give smooth experience while running heavy softwares also. At this price 79499 rs this is the best value for money laptop
5,"This is an awesome product from HP.It run very smooth, i purchase it for software development and i run Visual studio, Sql Server Management Studio, Chrome, Docker, Kubernetes, onedrive and many more application simultaneously and the laptop is running very smooth and fast.I recommend this laptop to anyone if he/she is buying for software development, this will be a best option."
4,"It‚Äôs light weight, i7 11th gen laptop. The battery life is good till now. The processor speed is 2.8Ghz.Below are few of my dislikes- It‚Äôs only 14 inch- There is no CD room- The graphics card is Intel Iris- The processor speed is 2.8Ghz not 4.7 mentioned."
4,Battery Life improved to 5-6 hrs after using for a month..Amazing perfomance
5,"1. Its light in weight easy to carry & due to core i7 processing is fast.2. Starting on and shut down, navigation to different browsers, application ,file copying all are swift.3. Backlight keyboard is a good feature & silver color adds more beauty to the looks of laptop.4. I can see many people complaining about processor speed shown as 2.80ghz but if they open task manager and see the speed it is really high. They need to run many applications to see the real speed.5. Only doubt is the headphone/mic jack as my 3.5 mm earphone is not entering so will be working with support team to find a solution.6. I am using many multiple VM's on this to see the performance & will post my views on this soon.7. I liked the laptop in many ways overall a satisfied product from HP in this budget."
5,"Pros: Fast, Adequate battery, Display clarity, light weight ( Subjective to individuals), Sound is awesome, NVIDIA boosts it's capabilities.Cons: No Touch screen, SSD could have been been better with 1TB."
5,"I have been using this laptop for about 2 weeks now and can only say good things about it. I don't have to speak about configuration, that you all know is quite good. What additionally I can use is though it is not light or slim, but it is sleek and does not heat up while using, unlike other light and thin models."
5,"This laptop is good for Programmers and it is running like mac pro, smooth multitasking and battery life is good.Not for people who don't like 14 inch screen."
5,"Hello allFirstly I'll like to tell that this is one of best product from hp that's out there. I went with 2gb graphic card one. Activating office is little tricky, else everything works on getgoIf you don't want graphic card then you can go for ryzen 5 version which is around 20k cheaper than this one.Best laptop in 14 inch category, period!"
1,"This laptops heats a lot from day 1, settings & BIOS updates etc, wont work, fan makes noise and throws air continuously ... i replaced the laptop but in the replaced laptop also same issues even in bigger form...lot of heat , air and fan nosie....  Amazon & delivery agents are not supportive regarding return, its been more than 4 times coordinated with Amazon for return, everytime return rescheduled because delivery agent dint come also they will mention the reason that you are not ready with return (false reasons for not picking return)Pathetic experience of Laptop + Amazon service, would suggest not to buy laptop from Amazon!"
1,"The display of colours, clarity of images and videos was far below expected for this premium laptop if it was a manufacturing problem for the specific laptop delivered to me. USB port for Bluetooth connectivity was faulty and could not connect to the mouse bluetooth adaptor"
5,"My first choice was to take Microsoft Surface. Instead, I have got the highest configured 14-inch laptop for the same price that Microsoft Surface Laptop doesn't. Comparatively, HP provides a high quality, light weighted laptop for a reasonable price. Worth grabbing it."
5,Best as i have expected.I only trust Hp for laptopsPros1. Light weight2. Amazing display3. Smooth experience4. Keyboard5. Easy to carry6. Superb performance for business purposes or designing purposeCons1. Battery not that much satisfactory2. Safe old charger3. Plastic body but still look metal finish4. If you don't have this laptop at this moment its your loss.5. MOST FRUSTRATING IS HEATING ISSUEI am satisfied with the quality and durability.
1,"Did not like anything about this laptop....price, keyboard layout, hp support, customer is a joker.... customers are just there to generate revenue for these manufacturers..."
4,"It's a good laptop within the price range.11th generation i7 with 1TB SSD for 85k is nice deal.All the below things are good:1. Display2. Laptop body ( does not feel like plastic though other reviews stats that)3. Excellent performance ( worked on development tool parallely, no issues)4. Comfortable keypadOnly concern is backup battery life which is around 4 hours with full charge."
1,It's not even a month I bought this new laptop & am facing laptop shutdown issues frequently & on restart it don't save session before shutdown & I loose all work....on Googling I find reason to be related to internal power supply issue(I don't have power outage @ home but it's has to do with internal power supply) very disappointed to see such pathetic product after paying so high amount.
4,"I am software engineer mainly working on Citrix. Using this laptop for work. No problem with screen resolution, after working for 8 hours on average mode battery drops to 20% . No heating issues so far, amazing speakers, it's super fast laptop. Only camera is of low quality, but zoom meeting seems to give bearable experience.To conclude, it's best business laptop for windows users. I chose this over MacBook Air M1 because I have always been windows user and I needed best specifications like blazing speed, loud speakers, many ports, 16GB RAM, large and fast SSD, dual monitor connectivity etc. This is the best we can get. Hope this review helps people."
1,Laptop generates lot of heat.At this heft price tag this is unacceptable.
5,"Battery life is about 2.5 to 4 hours of moderate use inluding web browsing, watching film, online class etc. With digital drawing tablet and wired mouse attached"
3,"This is the review after 2 days of useIt's lightweight and looks robust.Installed a few resource hungry softwares (DaVinci resolve) and no issues noticed till now.In day light, don't forget to switch-off the keypad back lights, else you won't recognize the keys! Also, after using touch screens for quite some time, working without touch support cause confusion at times.. but considering the price and other features, I guess it's fine.This will be good for programmers or mid kevel video editing works (if you got an additional monitor). The only problem I faced, tried connecting a 2nd led screen with HDMI and not detecting it as a second screen. Voice also not working while connected to second screen."
3,Do go by the looks of the laptop.  Only 2 USB port and another 1 type 3 port and it seems not compatible with my current docking station.Screen can't be titled downward. Restricted Screen.  Old design.Display is good. Performance so far ok ok ok. I prefer some alternatives.
1,I've been using the product for 3 days now. It's fast and good.The port in the right seems to have gone inside and I'm unable to use anything on that side. So now I have only one input port. Whom am I to contact? I have tried to return the product and call all possible numbers. I need some response.
5,"The product arrived on time with a neat packing. Laptop look and feel are too great. I felt it is too smaller, may be because I was using a bigger one earlier. It is too early to tell about performance, but it is found to be faster. high responsiveness. Battery is draining too fast which makes me worried. I have to use and wait for more detailed review."
5,"Bought this laptop after some research and comparisons. Performance is good, no issues at all. It is Light weight, easy to carry.Fast enough to do all the basic works and photo editing. Not tried till date for video editing. But i am sure it will perform well. Battery is not that great but it‚Äôs manageable. Expect 4-5 hours of back up. Overall spec. are very good and this the primary reason, i went for it.Putting this review after using it for a month."
1,"It is really wastage of money, this machine is not worth it. It's just 3-4 months and it is creating an issue, it is giving a blue screen issue of death, upon contacting the helpdesk they suggested to re-install the operating system and I did that but again after 10-15 days issue again re-started coming.I am trusted with this machine and not getting any help from HP support. Their call wait time is killing.I would request HP to please return my hard earn money and take away your junk box.Request amazon to consider this request and help to resolve this issue."
4,Laptop with great config and looks. Only think I felt HP should have given with this is Laptop Bag along with the laptop.
4,"I replaced my 7 years old HP 15 A series laptop with i5 and 12 GB (extended RAM) + AMD Graphics card + Dual OS with this one.I was expecting to move everything to windows and leave out Ubuntu completely with this one.Pros :Well, the SSD significantly improved the booting time to seconds. Display is better and laptop is smaller and lightweight.Cons :The extended display i have is not working properly with Windows OS and I think it's because of the Graphics Drivers.Power button is included in the main keyboard and I think it's a poor design choice.I had to go back to my Dual OS set up shortly a week after buying this one. I guess I really like Ubuntu. :)I use to : work, study, streaming and occasional gaming"
2,"******* Don't buy this product ********I have purchased this product from Amazon on July 2021. But the problem is that getting blue screen frequently with some error message and also unable to contact customer care directly, So I‚Äôm frustrated with these errors now. Because getting errors while working with important tasks.My return date also completed , So unable to return this item here and also unable to contact customer care directly. Always chatting with useless virtual agent."
5,"I think this is the most advance notebook one can get ,In such a priceHP GERMAN , PLUS i7Graphic quality is superb ,Overheating systems are superb , once the laptop overheats at a level it cuts the power automatically,Restarts whenever you feel its cold,The first time i saw this feature ,Lightweight, Easy to carry ,HP Pavillion i7 is a bond notebook"
5,"If you are student have a lot of excel modelling to do, multi-task to do GO FOR IT.If you are working professional looking to work on multiple applications without Lag GO FOR IT.I don't think there is any brand out there currently giving so much at 85k as HP is giving."
5,"Very light weight, value for money."
4,"The product has good specifications. Although the price appeared a bit high (85k), the features are worth going for. Superfast usage because of processor and RAM. Camera quality is not great. In addition, the screen cannot be tilted/folded much."
1,"Bought it on 14 Aug'21, the display stopped working on 15th September'21. Logged a case with HP support and followed up more than twenty times at each point of contact and till date haven't received the quotation as they say it's physical damage and not covered under warranty. Whereas when I raised the issue there were no signs of physical damage.Worst experience one can have after paying such amount also availed extended warranty for the same.Don't know when or how they will even resolve this issue or not.Won't recommend HP to anyone ever!!! Waste of such capital."
1,"From day 1 I m updating it , and it's not workingWindows getting freezedUsb port not workingAndIN HP YOU HAVE ALL BUT YOU CAN find service station or any mode to raise complaint.. when you raise complaint they will make to dontroublsoots every time nd will take your whole day..Window will take whole night to update and thereafter window will get freezed .. you can do anythingI am going back on Mac Book andI will make sure I will sue Amazon, H.p and seller to sell such a pathetic product"
4,"I got the laptop last night. It is amazing. The display is awesome. The laptop is very light and it is well constructed overall. The keyboard is great with a few quirks e.g. A somewhat strong backlight. The performance is awesome. Kudos to Lenovo for bringing an excellent product at the right price point to market.There is an inbuilt facility LENOVO VANTAGE to check your laptop overall performance.You can do Hardware Scan, System Update, Enable Dolby, Enable Rapid charge, Enable Network Boost.1. CPU-Intel(R) Core(TM)i5-10300H CPU @ 2.50GHz. Very powerful processor.2. RAM-Samsung 8GB. RAM is not enough. For improved performance, more than 8 GB need to be upgraded.3. The design is very cool and the fabrication quality is very good.4. The battery is like most gaming laptops.5. GPU-NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 makes the gameplay flawless.6. SSD-Samsung 250GB. More than enough to boot OS smoothly.7. HDD-WDC 1 TB. Enough to handle the storage.8. 15.6-inch Full HD with 120 Hz IPS screen for better viewing angles, outstanding image quality and color accuracy.9. The sound and bass quality is really good. Must use the headset in a noisy environment otherwise you will not be able to hear the speaker even with full volume.Top of that you get access to over 100 high-quality Xbox game paas. After one month your subscription continues to be charged at the regular price and selected terms unless cancelled in Microsoft account."
1,"Battery life is not good, approximately 2 hr on full charge. Display quality isn‚Äôt up to the mark. Laptop has internet connectivity issues."
5,Considering the prize( i bought it for 64k ) its very good. U get 120hz panel n other hardware is very good also there is fast charger. Camera privacy shutter is very good addition.
4,"This is best laptop in this price everything is great, with advanced features, best for gaming,study, work, because of its high performance capability.The only thing to be improved in this laptop is BATTERY not very great, hardly 2 hours backup, Better to plugged in for most of the time.Except this everything is just wow, keyboard backlight, privacy camera think shutter, great anti glare high resolution screen, great thermal management,great decent look.Simply good laptop."
5,"First of all build quality is very good it's very light for its build and it's also very solid for a plastic build, second Screen Quality is just awesome and with 120hz it gives a very fast fps for gaming and for normal use, Third Thermals in a strong build and great screen the thermals are very good as it doesn't heat up the laptop and because of its lenovo Vantage you can maintain the thermals pretty well, Now for Gaming I'll be honest I am not much of a gamer so I didn't care for fps or benchmarks but this laptop blew me away with its 1650 gtx and its gaming as by its name it is a beast in gaming and finally its battery, for a great gaming and thermal with heavy performance laptop the battery is pretty good, you'll find in many reviews that the battery life is only 1 or 2 hours but that is not true, if you are using it for surfing on internet or watching a movie or Netflix and chill it will give you approx 3-4 hours of run time but if you're just thinking of gaming in this you'll need to keep it charging during gaming as it will give you 1 - 2 hours max but if you ask me I didn't find it much bothering as I used laptop for 30 mins in surfing over net and then I watched a movie for 2 hours and then it was like 27% on battery and then i kept it on charging while playing call of duty it worked smoothely and the battery didn't bother me, so if you're looking for casual gaming with multi tasking this laptop is your soulmate."
5,"Everthing is fine. The builds is best in the market. No other laptop brand giv s rhis level of toughness. Just one con I would like to mention that while I was playing a game in the game the right mouse button was for aiming and simultaneously left is for shooting. But while I preesed right button to aim and at the same time i wanted  to shoot But it didn't took the left input. Basically it only takes one input at a time. Fortunately I also purchased a Dell wireless keyboard and mouse which solved my issue. But once again this is much better than the legion laptop as it gives you a professional look also and also allows to run heavy games like gta 5 , cyberpunk and also can run gta 6 with these specs. So if you are a casual gamer and doesn't want a gaming look just go for it."
1,"Writing this review after a week of usage.Pros:1. Design is very attractive with very good body finish.2. Keyboard is pretty good.Cons:1. NVidia card is useless as no decent graphic demanding games like GTA 5, Euro Truck Simulator 2 are not running on this laptop. Only games that are sufficient to run on regular intel IRIS XE graphics like CS GO, Far Cry: Primal are working fine. Not getting any help from Lenovo or Lenovo community to get these graphic related issues addressed. So if you are planning to buy considering its NVidia card, don't buy.2. Battery backup is hardly 2-3 hours even with low load like documents work and web browsing.3. Charging most of the times do not work, not sure if it is a manufacturing defect or pin problem. Have to keep the laptop plugged in always."
5,"If you want it only for pure gaming then you can look out for better options.If you are looking for a personal laptop, decent gaming, programming then this will a very good laptop.Pros:‚óèNice built quality‚óèExpandable RAM‚óèSsd + hdd drive‚óèBacklit keyboard‚óèHigh performanceCons:‚óèBattery backup (refer note)‚óèDisplay brightness (depends on your eyes üòÇ)‚óèSpeaker Sound is decent. If you are at a noisy place or your fan speed is at max then you will find it difficult to hear the sound. But at normal times it is fine.Note: Battery backup completely depends on personal usage. As i mentioned above if you buying it for personal use like coding, surfing internet then you can switch to battery saver mode. Battery will easily last for 4hrs+ on 100% charge.Brightness is 250nits only. You may feel like it is little dim. Brightness has to be set to more than 85% only then ul feel like the display is bright. But this is also ok. If you are indoors then it doesnot matter.Iam 100% satisfied with the purchase because i took this after a good research according to my requirements. Check if the laptop has all the features and ticks all the checkboxes in your checklist so that you will not be disappointed after your purchase.I brought it for 57k in sale üòçüòçüòçü•≥ü•≥ü•≥Not recommended if the price is above 65/67k. You can get better laptops at that price than this one."
5,"Completely satisfied with this laptop be it booting time, to processing (medium to little heavy) to size or battery backup. Seems to be a perfect configuration. Comes loaded with win10. It has 8GB Ram(which seems to be sufficient) but can be extended to 16GB along with NVIDIA GTX 1650 with 4gb DDR 6 graphic RAM. It has 120Hz IPS display. Totally satisfied. Could be a little cheaper as it a hybrid system with 256 GB SSD drive and 1 TB regular Hard Drive."
5,"I've hadthe laptop for a konth now and I can say with confidence that it is a very decent laptop. I've seen people complain about the battery which I've had no problem with, because I don't game on the laptop on battery, I usually use it on conservative mode while plugged in as it is obvious that the battery would dry out quick while gaming. The display is great, keyboard and mousepad is very response, the speakers are a let down. So far I've not experienced any noticable problems with it, and for the price I bought it in (60k) it is great, and I highly recommend it."
4,"Advantages:Very smooth performance.good refresh rate.Instant turn on without delay.good screen lighting and comfortable keypad.Disadvantages:Not much, need to explore more as my laptop is just <1 month old as of now.I feel its a little heavy to carry. But as the configurations are high for this price range, its ok to compromise on weight.As it is a gaming laptop, battery backup will be less. currently 3 to 4 hours for me. I might have to change the settings."
1,"I bought this laptop because I need to work on a few softwares. After buying this laptop, I found out that my old buisness laptop works as good if nit better. I'm disappointed for the following reasons-1) The processing speed is not as fast as I expected. It's just an average laptop.2) It's same with all other gaming laptops, but I'm just mentioning- the laptop is very bulky and heavy. The adaptor is very heavy and bulky too.3) It does not include MS Office licence. We'll have to buy that seperately. There are laptops in the same range which involve MS Office licence, check them out before buying this. You'll have to spend extra 7.5k for official MS Office home version.4) The battery backup is mentioned to be around 6.5 hours, maybe that's when the laptop is not being used. It came to be around 2.5 hours for continuous moderate-to-heavy usage.5) The maximum volume is a bit low. It works for music, but it's difficult to listen to someone speaking on a call/meeting when there is some noise on my side (when I switch on the fan or some other random noises)Apart from the display, nothing else is great. It works just alright. I didn't buy this laptop for gaming, so I don't know about the gaming experience. Nevertheless, check a lot of other options before buying this laptop."
5,Display quality and laptop performance is marvelous but  battery backup is not upto mark its provide only 2.30hr backup only even on normal use.

1,It's display is not working.
4,"I am using this laptop from past 4 days and my true reviews are-First of all display. It's pretty good and the colors are also fine.The battery is the main issue. With normal office work and meetings it can only run upto 3 to 3.5 hours maximum.Other performance is great.The speakers could be better and the microphone can also be better.The cooling system is not upto mark it cant cool down the laptop quickly. In 15 min of 1080p gaming it was heated and wasnt able to cool down.the charger is pretty good. It charges the laptop in 1.5 hours . Overall if you want to do office work,editing and programming it is good in this price but if you want to do only gaming there are many other laptops you can go for in this price range"
4,4star is due to very Poor Battery. 3 hours max with 100% charging which is very bad. I bought it in store not in Amazon. I would suggest to consider this point for battery backup. I upgraded with 8 more GB of RAM. Robust machine with good features. There r other brands in this processor segment which can be considered but the price variation is there. Overall good with disappointing battery backup which is a not good for WFH.
5,All are fine loved the laptop best screen quality and mouse also so good for gaming purpose it is a budget beast
2,Battery life is very poor as it get fully discharge in 1hr- 1.25 hrs.Overall performance is below average .
4,"Just got the laptop couple of days ago. So far so good.Performance : 10/10 . I got the i7 variant with 16 gb ram ans its performing flawlessly. Snappy environment, easily run machine learnign algorithms in python. I play couple of AAA games and it's running smooth with 80-90 fps easily.Screen : 6/10 the screen leaves a lot to be desired. It's a 200 hz screen so better for gaming but the sRGB and color profiles are not atall upto mark. 250 nits is really too low. Wish they provided the 60hz 300 nits 100% rgb screen through amazon as well (it's available in lenovo official website, just paying 1700 rupees more you can update the screen but the overall custom laptop costs 1.2 lakhs with same config). If you want photo editing and video editing you need to install an external screen ( it has usb-c video port)Battery: 9/10 I get it why people has so much complaint about battery backup. Yes it gives 1.5 hours of backup but you can increase it to 5+ hours (last night I did heavy coding and browsing for 4.5 hours with 30% battery left). The trick is toi) enable hybrid mode.ii) while in battery backup press fn+q to make it in silent mode so that the fan speed reduces and uses less power.iii) reduce screen brightness by 2 pointsiv) switch off bluetooth if not usingThis should be enough to give 5 hours of backup easily.Asthetic: (5/10) the only thing I hate more than the screne is the body work of laptop. It's a fingerprint magnet. Just touching it will leave finger print marks and oil stains on the keyboard if you have an oily skin or living in a warm climate. I have a ThinkPad also but it does not have the same problem. The rubberized texture of the body is extremely poorly designed, just simple plastic will do better. Now I am looking for laptop skins to put on and using external keyboard for gaming and coding.Overall it is a solid performer with few flaws. If those doesnot matter to you then definately go ahead and buy it."

It does catch the hand marks but you can clear them off easily5) I saw several reviews complaining of the battery but if you turn on the balanced mode(which is sufficient for my office work) then it easily gives 4-5 hours of backup. If the balanced mode is not turned on it gives 2 hours max.Cons:1) display is okaish. You will miss the brightness in this one as the max brightness looks little dull.2) web camera is not upto the mark3) I got the GTX 1650 which is unreasonable at the price I paid.4) Though the laptop doesn't heat up I did face some issues keeping it on the lap and working as it feels slighlty warm there.Hopefully Lenovo has good after sales support too :) Will definitely recommend this laptop

1,Very bad
4,"Hello,I'm writing this review after using this laptop for a month.I bought this product for my daughter's online school education. As such this laptop does pretty well on that front. No doubt that Avita has cut lot of corners to provide a product in this budget which should be expected, afterall laptops with decent performance are not cheap. Buy this if you only intend to surf internet, online learning, emails and work on MS Word or such document softwares. As the processor is very basic don't have much expectation for gaming or any other processing heavy programs.Positives:1. Screen is gorgeous with minimal bazels.2. Weighs really light. A kid can easily handle it which translates into less chances of damage.3. Good on-site service. I placed a request, the technician visited next day and was able to address my concerns.4. Sufficient battery life.5. Looks cool and different.6. Good enough camera.7. SSD provides smooth performance. There is no lag whatsoever. Laptop boots up within some seconds. Got 192 Gb usable space out of 237 gb. Connect external hdds or usb drives if more space needed.Negatives:1. Wifi range is poor.2. All the ports are at the back which makes them hard to reach.3. Positioning of the camera is on the keyboard surface which gives no flexibility to manage its angle. However, apart from an awkward position, there is no hindrance in capturing the subject using the laptop.4. Power chord length is quite short.5. Track pad isn't very smooth but manageable. I had to bump up its settings in Windows. Using an external mouse will provide better experience.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase."
4,"The product is good but it has some problems , first If your thinking that you can do gaming in this laptop , then it will not work , DON'T BUY THIS LAPTOP FOR GAMING, you can use it for office work and normal students type work , 2nd amd most worst part is you are not going to get its accesories , because AVITA is not known in India."
4,"After reading  so many different feedback on different products I made my self to order this laptop which is not so old and trusted brand let me tell you ,  but the most attractive things of this laptop is it is providing same features which is there in other brand at high price , but this  the only brand in the market which comes below 25k , thats why people get attract , but using this laptop for only one day, it is not even twitching on , seems like dead automatically I have request to call centre and asked them to replace,amd I trust amazon it is known for its service over the world so no meed to worry about ... Thank you"
3,"Comes with genuine windows 10, and also office installed but not activated.Camera quality is ok, but position is weird. You can't adjust angle.All ports are in backside, may be difficult to access them.Screen Quality is good.No cooling fan, system will heatup easily after a 30 mins use.Touchpad experience is not good. Though it is working, it is not comfortable.Screen to body ratio is highGood looking with good design.Amazon delivery is very good and package packing is also good."
5,"Fully satisfied with laptop. Bought it for online classes, net surfing and for my documents it does absolutely great work in all those areas.Surely not for gaming purpose. SSD drive makes it really fast in booting. Although it's processor is not so powerful therefore lag is visible when you go for heavy multitasking; CPU meter easily reaches 100.There is no fan in the bottom at times it even terrifies that overheating may not harm it internally. Screen is gorgeous therefore no issue with movie watching."
5,Boot in 22 secondsWord Excel and PPT works without any hasslesCamera angle is fine. If we keep it in the table it's very goodLight weightTeams and Telegram works fineOnline video plays fineOverall a value for money package

1,Product delivered on time but keyboard stopped working after 15 days. Didn't get it repaired even in one month. No return after 10 days so I have to face the harassment. After a month even customer service don't respond..Don't buy..

5,"Nice performance ,best battery ,worth buying ,cheap in price , , , , , , , , , , ,"
1,This is a bad product don't go for it wasteof money waste of time don't buy it please üôè .
4,Very nice laptop for students and work from home. I think you should go buy this lappy if you are student and employee in any company
4,"Ordered this based on immense research. Certainly one of the best options available in this price (~‚Çπ60K). I ordered 2, however the second one was defective, ordered a replacement again, got another defective product. Returned it, ordered a seperate model with 120Hz, received defective charger. Pissed me off. This issue arrised despite Amazon assuring me they will quality check my replacement product.Anyway, the laptop itself, I've bought 2 of. 1 from Amazon and 1 offline from Lenovo (got it cheaper there too) and it's genuinely good. So if you're seeing the reviews to find whether this is a good laptop, YES. It is! I use it for Video Editing and Programming. Programming is tough with just 8GB RAM, I might upgrade that. But the CPU performance I get is great. Not a gamer, so can't speak for that. But Nvidia's 1650 has a fantastic reputation with games, so you need not worry.Buy this laptop over the Legion, TUF and Nitro. It's better overall. As for this seller, make sure you're thoroughly checking your product in the return period. I've had issues more than twice.If you've read this far, mark this comment as 'Helpful' so other people see it too. Good luck."
5,"This is going to be long. So lets go with pros and cons.Pros:Build and Keyboard: I was surprised to see the build was so sturdy given the fact that it's plastic. Coming to the keyboard it is one of the best I've ever used. The blue backlit is looks great(would've preferred for an RGB though).Thermals and Fans :The thermals were quite good for a laptop around 60k and the fan sound was barely audible even in performance mode.The laptop does get heated while playing AAA games but nothing much to be worried about.Performance: The AMD Ryzen 5 core works like a charm, it gives intel i7 10th gen a run for its money.The boot up time is around 4-6 sec with the SSD.All the FPS games ran pretty smoothly even with ultra settings.Others: The Lenovo Vantage software is a plus and so is the privacy shutter(which I think every laptop should have by the way)Cons:Display: Nothing great to be excited about here. Both the brightness and color accuracy of the screen are average.Battery: Okay so I see Lenovo changed their stance on battery life from 6.7 hrs to 5 which is more accurate . While gaming the battery lasted for about 90 min.During normal usage it lasts for 3.5 - 4 hrs, although it did last for 5 hrs when the settings were under Quiet mode.Speakers: The speakers were okay and I expected nothing more from a laptop of this price range(I mostly use headphones anyway).So to conclude this just might be one of the best gaming laptop under 65k if not the best and you could totally go for it."
4,"First of all, an epic laptop. Comes with all specs i require. I am not so much into gaming and the processor is fabulous. Comes with a superb quality display and a cool looking blue backlight. Its fast afüî•. It runs like butter. Overall not so much for gaming. If you're considering for gaming, you should go with the 1660ti version. But met my requirements.A bit cons --The body is a magnet to fingerprints, need to regularly clean with a cloth.-Weight is a bit more-60 hertz only if you're here for gaming. For me this is no issue.Conclusion- You should definitely consider buying, I didn't trust Lenovo lately but its value for money üëç"
4,"First I appreciate the delivery by Amazon as promised timeline even during this covid situation.Below is my Lenovo IdeaPad gaming 3 config,AMD Ryzen 5 4600h, 512 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram, 120HZ, Nvidia GTX 1650.Model.no: 82EY00UAIN1. Full HD display is really good at this price.2. Build quality is good and the structure is simply the best.3. Keypad, trackpad and backlight are very nice.4. The laptop boots up with in 5 sec, it's awesome.Everything is perfect except the below 2 items,1. Battery is draining little faster for normal usuage itself.2. Audio speaker is not as good as  expected.In a nutshell I would say this is a very good budget gaming laptop if you are looking around 60k."
5,"Lenovo ideapad gaming 3 120Hz- I used this about 10 days. I am sharing my 10 days experiance with this system.1.BULID QUALITY: Screen side body is bulid by somekind of Fiber which is very stiff and the lower body is bulid by plastic but it feels like a premium. Laptop design is ultimate.For Bulid quality and design it can get 5/5 definitly.2. CAMERA: One grate thing about camera is they give Privacy shutter feature through which u can lock your camera. A good camera security feature.Camera quality is not good.It's worst. It gives too much pixalated images.You can record video upto 720p 30fps. It is better to purchase external camera if you are a creator/Live streamer.3. KEYBOARD: It is full size keyboard. Key design and the quality is awesome. This keyboard design wil helps to comfort and accurate typing. Key movement is also good. It has two modes of backlight(BLUE color). The blue colored key light feels like premium. One important thing is, You should always take care(clean) of keybord, Any dust and stones kind of small particles will easely enter below the keys and may cause problems when typing. Always clean keyboard before using it.4. BATTERY: Battery life is decent. For me It gives almost 6hrs to 6.5hrs in 'bettter performance' mode where I done coding and MS word kind of things which doesn't need much CPU power.5. DISPLAY: 15.6"" 120Hz Full HD IPS anti-glare display gives Very smooth video experiance. Plays 4k videos well. Viewing angle is also good.6.AUDIO QUALITY: It comes with Dolby Atmos Stereo speaker. Sound is loud and clear(i don't felt any kind of noise from the speakers). It is more than enough.7. STORAGE: It comes with 512GB SSD.There is a dedicated HDD slot,We can insert 1 TB of HDD along with this 512GB SSD there.8. PERFORMANCE: I have not tested any game,it may works fine. Gives awesome performance for office work and multitasking. If video editing concerned, Try to buy 16GB RAM varient or upgrade this system to 16GB, So that you can get better performance(working fine in 8GB also).CONCLUSION: Under 60-63k,It's realy worth and value for money.Best video and audio experiance, grate performance."
5,Above expectations.
5,"Just got it about 10 days ago. So can't give a proper review as such. So this is not a long term usage review.Pros:-Consistently string performance-No heating at all-Good anti glare-Not as heavy as i thought it would beBuild though plastic, is quite sturdy. If don't believe that metal is always the best solution. Considering the weight, kind of laptop etc.-Amazing keyboard. It's well thought out and has a good feel, and didn't experience any flexing.-Keyboard with 2 levels of back light. Make it clear in the darkest of environments.Cons: Not many-Average battery life.-Color accuracy of the screen is poor. It's fine for someone like me but do consider this when buying-Web cam is below average."
5,"for the price , it delivers  quality performance. Worth buying!"
5,It's a fantastic beast man. Just go for it. Best value for money. One of the best in this price range. Before buying I just worried about Lenovo' s build quality. But in this case Lenovo proven me wrong. The build quality is good and gives premium look. Hardware wise there is nothing new to say. But the package is good for this price range. Battery life is good while playing movies/ streaming online can run till 4 to 5 hours. While programming it can hold upto 3 to 4 hrs. I didn't tried on gaming. However this is ok for the given hardware.
3,"Yes, you read the headline right. If any of that is not your priority, you may go ahead with the laptop. It's a good laptop, don't get me wrong, but1. if you're expecting the advertised battery performance, then you will be disappointed - immensely. I get at most an hour, which to my requirement is good enough. I always look for power source nearby, and if there is none, I try to limit my electronic (phone, laptops etc) usage. It's all right with me, but maybe not with you.2. if you're expecting a ""premium"" support, as advertised, then you will be disappointed again. Exactly the day AFTER my return window with Amazon ended, I found out that the number 5 on the right-side number pad gets stuck. ONE day! A conglomerate like Amazon should be in a place to make exceptions, but it's all right, I was still within Lenovo's warranty,  and because of that, I was asked by the Amazon representative to contact them - and I did. By bad support, I am not talking about the support I got from Amazon - this guy was just following standard protocol - it's Lenovo's! The same day, I raised a ticket with them, and it's been a week now, and I haven't gotten ANY call/email/message from them. Now I hear you ask, ""But doood. If you haven't gotten any email or message, the complaint wouldn't have gone through or registered"", to which I say, I see the ticket number when I go to the Lenovo portal, and it's in ""Investigating"" status (or something like that). You get the point. ONE WEEK of premium support (or lack thereof)!**UPDATE** - Lenovo finally acknowledged the request and some 8 - 9 tos-and-fros later, agreed to send a technician, who found out the issue is real and agreed for a replacement (Obviously it wasn't all this simple - this whole process took him about 2 hours). FYI, as on this writing, the replacement is yet to arrive (and the laptop is sealed in a Lenovo branded cover with its carton box - post Covid-19 procedure I suppose - and is in my custody). And that's 2 days without laptop- Just saying :/3. if you expect to play a lot of newer games - I haven't tried this personally, and I bought this laptop not (entirely) for gaming (although I had installed CoD Ghosts (I know it's an old game), and after like an hour into the game, it glitched on me once - at a place when there was a huge explosion, maybe the graphics card couldn't process that much info) but I must say it's been a good performer. I ran my DL (deep learning) model with over 1 crore rows, and about 17 columns and it performed better than my work laptop, which has (only) a 16 gb RAM, no external graphic card. I will upgrade the RAM on this to 16 (it's 8*1 now and I will add another equivalent 8 (3200/CL-22)) and see how it goes, but all that after I get the issue at hand sorted out.BTW, the reason I realized my keyboard had an issue late was because I use a Bluetooth keyboard and the only time I used its own keyboard was in its first day, and somehow I forgot to test the keyboard.FYI, it's a fingerprint magnet."
5,"REVIEW AFTER 10 DAYS OF USEI have been using this for last 10 days and this was awesome...got this after 2 days of order.PACKAGE:the packaging were good and they used some decent foam for support.BUILD QUALITY:the build quality was qutie good for this price range..it feels light enough for a gaming laptop..KEYBOARD/TRACKPAD:i really loved the keyboard and i really had good typing experience...for the trackpad it was good...and i mostly use external mouse...but the trackpad was fine..DISPLAY:the one downside is the display...i wont say it is the worst...but could be better...if u want to get better colour quality u can get a external monitor or get another system...but in this price range it is quite common..SPECS:for the specs its awesome...for around 60k u get a 6 core cpu 4600h wi=hich is amazing in long run..it has a dedicated gpu 1650 which is awesome..the ram is acceptable...quite common in this range...but can be easily upgraded to 16gb by adding a single 8gb stick..the m.2 ssd is nice gives a read speed of around 1700 which is awesome for laptops in this range..and also u can add additional hdd..i added a 512gb hdd and it works fine..PERFORMANCE:I installed premiere pro and photoshop and it was working perfect....i didnt overclock the system but i know it will do really good..i didnt try any games till now but will update in future but i am sure this can run most games in medium/high settings and get 60fps..TEMPS:for the temps it stays quite and in control while doing programming but can get little hot while doing some serious editing which is quite common..as it takes lots of cpu and gpu usage..OVERALL:i would definitely recommend this laptop.if u want a laptop for programming,editting,gaming this is the best choice for this price range...battery is average can get some 4hrs avg while using vs code and chrome...and 2-3 hours during editting..i would reccomend to upgrade the ram as soon as possible to get more perfomance outtaa this..if u want to get a more of a gaming laptop this is a OK choice as it has only 1650 and the display can hit u if u want good color precision...which can surely be eliminated by getting a good external display...i would give it a 8/10(as i didnt try any games on this deivce)will be updating more details after trying out new games and apps..make sure to give a thumbs up if u think this review helped u so that others can benefit from thisthanks :)"
2,Worst exhaust placement .burns linke hell when you place on lap.dont buy if you ant to use it on lap. Heavy as hell as well.
1,"Works just like a laptop without a GPU or I should say it's worst than it. Blender crashes everytime I render a very simple image without any texture.Charge lasts for an hour max. If you are working, you should always have the charger plugged in.The Sound is feeble. This one is not for listening to music or watching movies.It's a useless laptop for the price. I doubt the specs mentioned in the description are actually part of this model.If you are looking for a laptop for creative purpose or any other general use, please avoid this one. Don't go by the positive reviews."
5,"First thing , I am a college student and I am a Graphic Designer . Yaah.....I know this  laptop is not good for photo and video editing but if u r tight with the pocket you have to stick with this price range .1. Hand adjustment over this laptop is so comfy and smooth. It feels better than using a external keyboard.The curve in the keys makes the typing experince for you perfect .2.I don't play any kind of games .The task I will be using this beast is for photoshop and illustrator. And let me tell you something , ryzen 5 4600H is doing it's part of the job perfectly . This laptop has 8 GB ram which is good if u r only running a single software like photoshop. But , when I am using illustrator and photoshop together , i can see a small amount of lag, which you can solve by installing a one more 8GB ram stick. This will make you exprience smooth .3. I don't like those laptops which have a gaming look on their top ,I always go with a laptop which has a simpke and clean look and this guy is perfectly fits with my chiice . It just has a name lenovo on it and that's all rest is completely clean .4. The single blue light is really good with three levels of brigthness.This is best for you if you don't prefer a RGB light.5. I am a bit unsatisfied with the storage because this guy completely use it's 512GB SSD in C drive . I will buy a 1TB external HDD next month. You can install a 1TB HDD inside the laptop . You have this option.6. I got this buddy at 55k in Amazon great festival. If you r going with HP Victus of same specs , I would say you can save some money by sticking with this guy.7. There is one thing more , I would like to say about the speakers sound quality .Most of the youtubers are saying that the sound quality is not that good. But, I didn't felt any issue there. I speakers are loud enough that you can enjoy a movie with your bunch of idiot friends.8. The only point which is taking this guy overall performance down in front of me is that I can comfortably view things at minimum 75% brightness. Below that , it kind of start to become difficult.And more the brightness more the  battery drop, so if you come from a place where electricity is not that good, keep this thing in mind.7. In short, this guy stands on most of my needs and it doesn't give a hard time to my pocket."
5,Nice gaming laptop. Superb build quality.Battery drains fast. Sound can be a bit louder. Great display.Cost me 60k for r5 4600/8gb/512gb ssd/120hz / 4gb nvidia 1650.
5,Absolutely brilliant laptop  well designed well graphics best for coding but slightly weighty . Overall a beast .
5,"Its nice. Before you can buy it, there are couple of things you should remember.1. Its very heavy, it may not seem a big deal, but it will be soon enough.2. The plastic body seems vulnerable,so you may want to get ADP from lenovo3. I get around 5 hrs battery life with power saver and other battery savings methods. Other than these, i am satisfied with this purchase"
5,"G3 comes in a lot of variants, i got it with 8GB ram and 512 SSD. The factory SSD is intel and speeds only upto 1200 MB/S. I upgraded it to 970 EVO Plus and extra 8GB ram. The machine is pushed to its max. Battery backup is upto 5 hrs for movie watching. And stays for 10 hrs with screen off. This will suit mid gamers with a decent config"
4,Brilliant product. But one issue that I have is that the wifi driver stops working when you switch on when laptop is plugged in. Also battery backup is not up to mark but device has conservative mode charging so can't complain about battery backup. Really great for the discount I got on it. PS - I got a 1TB HDD upgrade kit for FREE
5,The laptop is totally value for money. The build quality and keyboard are some of the main difference in comparison to same range laptops.Without high ram usage it can easily last above 6 hrs of battery life.It's a beast in its price range.
4,Laptop's trackpad stopped working after 10 days and camera was defective. Since Amazon gives only 7 days. The return window waa closed for me. So contacted lenovo care and they sent parts and technician. He fixed it and now all smooth and nice. It's comes with damage warranty too plus you get premium Lenovo care for 1 year by default. Don't think tok much go for it.
5,"-For student it will be really help .-its for casual gamers and and student who are in engineering and Designing .-U can easily use software like Autocad , inventor , ANSYS ,CREO etc .-Don't worry about the Screen quality ,If you are new laptop user or you from middle class family  its just go for it.- Lenovo is trusted brand i use Lenovo all in one pc from last 6 year and still."
5,For gaming it's awesome. 50-60 fps for Valhalla have not tried other games yet but it's so smooth. Display is 120hz and it look so good. Battery life is 1-2 hr for continually gaming and 4-6 hr for normal usage. Loved it‚ù§Ô∏è
3,"Laptop performance is good so far, but the battery performance disappointed me, if u are into games don't buy this coz the battery lasts for only 30mins if u play any games.. Speaker volume is very low. It doesn't come with free office suite and anti virus, apart from these, laptop performance is gud.. Booting is fast and I didn't see any lagging if I run multiple applications.. Display is also amazing"
5,"Liked the product , performence is Excellent , display is good for beginner buyer or normal and gaming usage , battery is average got 3 1/2 to 4 at quiet mode and in balanced it's 2 1/2 to 3 hour , build quality is good"
5,"Best in class laptop in this budget ...don't hesitate , i have search info on laptop for 1 month and finall found this lenovo ideapad gaming 3 the best one in such price..go buy it!!"
4,Battery life is good . Nice thermals . No heat under normal usages and light gaming. Keyboard is better. Boots less than 10 seconds.
4,Good gaming laptop in 63k range. Boots up very fast. Laptop is very fast. Screen looks awesome. Go for it
1,I have received a used product for first time and then it got replaced with much older product than that so please don't buy products from lenovo unless you want to use someone used product
4,"Well, I had to replace my 6 yr old Mac book and since mac books were out of budget, had to look at windows.Was not keen to purchase a 15 inch as I wanted a compact laptop but no company was offering the same specs as these in a 60-70k price range in 13 inch category.The deal on Lenovo was excellent and I purchased it. Using it for nearly 2 months now.The best part is the specs especially it comes with a 4GB Nvidia graphics card.The speed is fast, doesn‚Äôt heat up, battery lasts for 4-5 hours and charges very fast.However, the only issue I face is with the mousepad  of the laptop.For some reason, the mousepad in 15 inch laptops is kept more towards the left. However, other companies give left & right click button on the mousepad, Lenovo doesn‚Äôt.This causes issues while browsing or copy and one has to look at the keypad to see where the left click or right click is.Otherwise no other issues."
3,"The laptop is fair for the price it come at. Allows for decent gaming performance at decent fps. Only mention to be made here is that the cooling fans are noisy & distracting all the time you play a game. Even during video calls the fans make some hype.The 3 stars are mainly for the Lenovo service. My laptop failed to start one day & I lodged a complaint with Lenovo on the 18th of August '21 (within warranty), I get a call back from the Lenovo team on the 21st of September '21 asking for details of the problem. When I asked the engineer why is he calling after more than a month, he stopped responding altogether & I had to disconnect the call after sometime."
5,"I purchased it in offer for 52K directly without any Card offer, for that price, without any doubt this is the best laptop, you can't find these specs at this price, specially i5 10th gen with 120 Hz Refresh Rate and the keyboard is of excellent quality with 4 GB GRAPHICS.Cons are average quality front camera but you have privacy shutter, and Battery is not bad, but for normal work, it can give you around 6 Hours, but in business laptop, you can get around 10 hours for using word n ppt etc."
2,Product is not to the mark. Battery was draining quickly and speakers were growling
1,The is laptop is absolutely the worst with very weak processor . I bought it in haste and didn't think clearly while purchasing it. It's a train wreck cannot handle heavy tasks and gaming etc. It has a clear thermal management issue and thermal throttle all the time. It simply reaches 99¬∞C for simple gaming for five minutes. That's it its a disaster purchase go for ryzen any gen but not intel. These chips cannot even beat the ryzen 2-3 rd gen chips in any possible grounds
2,"I recently bought the product, and the display was too bad. I already have another Lenovo laptop, but the new one which I bought has a yellowish display. Did the nightlight OFF, colour management, and several other fixes. But no luck. Can anyone help on this regard, please"
5,Laptoo boots so fast. Looks nice and sturdy. Runs fast. Gets hot when gaming other wise for normal processing it doesn't get hot.But the battery drains too quickly. Almost to the point it is useless.
4,Good
5,"Initial impressions are good. Overall performance is good with this price range. Battery lasts for around 2-3hrs in full performance mode and for normal use, it lasts for around 4+ hrs. Design is good and can blend in as office laptop."
5,The product is good for gaming but speaker sounds during game is low so attach external speakers to it for loud üîä gaming rest all with this laptop is amazing also u can expect windows 11 home update in this laptop in October
4,"Gaming-very good,screen - excellent, camera worst.,day to day usage-smooth.battery-average.."
4,Am worried about the excessive heating up ofsystem while gaming :
3,The sound ouput is not at all meetingthe expectations. Speaker quality not suitable for online meetings or entertainment.
5,Really nice for gaming
1,"Pre-installed office 365 do not include Outlook, Outlook Users Please Keep Away from this offer provided by Amazon or be ready to invest 4 to 6K for Outlook subscription."
5,"Overall good, fast startup, keypad light is awesome. No heating observed."
3,"Not a good purchase. 3 days back purchased for 39990, now it's price is 34990 after coupon discount of 5k. Really feeling cheated. Feeling very disappointed"
5,Got it for 34990 after coupon discount in diwali sale. Got upgraded to windows 11 right away. Has a neat SIM slot that works like a charm (tried with JIO sim and works flawlessly) Office is included. 8gb RAM with 500 GB SSD is a killer deal at this price.
4,"Its 14 inch display instead of 15.6 inch display(HP 14 (2021) Thin & Light 10th Gen Intel Core i3, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 15.6-inch (39.6 cms) FHD Screen, Windows 10, MS Office, 4G LTE Connection, Natural Silver(14s-er0502TU))"
5,Excellent look slim and great for professional work not so good for gamming.

Everything about this laptop is phenomenal except backlit keyboard and antiglare display. Now this laptop can be easily used for coding, video editing, gaming but not extreme and everything else which remains üòÇ. And at last never believe on any youtube review cause they are all paid actors. PEACE OUT ü§û"
4,"Giving this review after 3 days of use I like this laptop it's good for students and buissness man and those who need to travel more I liked the laptop too much but only I have 1 issue with this that it starts heating after 30-40 min I didn't run any heavy app I am a student I just watching youtube on edge browser so it's sometimes feels frustrating But it's very light laptop U can carry it anywhere no problem and it didn't lag also with simple tasks U can do browsing, use ms office, and play some games that are not of high graphics."
5,"Awesome piece from hp. Processor and performance is excellent, battery backup is excellent up to 7-8 hour. Premium look at this range. Best and affordable for college's students and also for working on it.Just go for it , best laptop under 50k"
1,"Issues with battery percentage it always remains constant neither increases or decreases and when it gone to total drain state suddely it will power of and with this we loose unsaved work in laptop , i faced this issue in replacement product too so please check after purchase about this issue"
4,My previous AMD processor used to get hot very soon but someone told me to buy this new version and it doesn't heats up but it does gets hot though intensity is lesser this time. May be coz of metallic body

4,In this laptop only two USB port given and also laptop fan's  given at back side. From my points of view atleast one USB port should be more and  üíª  fan should be at any side of laptop that reduces overheating of laptop .Overall this laptop is good at this price range .
1,"This laptop is supposed to have 16gb RAM and I have received only 8gb of RAM in min, on the box it says 8+8 but the laptop only shows 8gb, There's not even a graphic card in this, once I logged into NVIDIA settings, it showed no graphic card detected, this looks like a scam by the seller."

Screen wobbling like Rubber.3.Metalic finish is like pure plastic finish.-4.Web cam - 1980 s VGA camera with Full grain.5. Speakers Audio output =  basic phone output.Only ProScreen resolution and Clarity which is not a pro with these many cons"
5,"I have gaming 3 screen setup at home and bought this one to replace my macbook 13"" for travel and work.Pros :-1. Amazing battery life( Above 12 hours everytime I used it and even more).2. Screen size with 16:10 so much extra space.3. Screen quality and color accuracy on this thing is amazing.4. Able to use VScode for frontend with multiple browsers with multiple tabs open without any lag.5. Was able to run linux/Ubuntu WSL2 on windows for running my projects.6. Upgrade to windows 11 and everything feels much better now.7. Keyboard keys are wide which helped in typing accuracy above 96% most of the time.8. Camera for video calls is good enough.9. Speakers on this is good enough please set the music mode to automatic in dts:x settings.10. So light no words.11. Amazing texture and look of the laptop.Cons -1. There was McAfee installed on the system with some cyberlink softwares. (removed them at first sight)2. LG doesn't know how to make good advertisements for their amazing line of products."
5,"I got it at 82990 , mainly for media consumption purpose , for that is perfect.It gets little bit heated at bottom. By default sound is very low but tune dts x app and sound will be perfect fineDisplay is gorgeous with QHD+ and 16:10 display web pages look beautifulConstruction quality is top notch and sturdy will little bit of flex in chassis  which is understandable as it's 17 inch .No laptop bag or pouch is provided .Bezels are narrow .Battery life is fantasticKey caps are largeIt has 2 level of backlitCharging is via type C portTrackpad is large and super smoothOverall enjoyed using laptop"
5,"Single hand open is the best!!Large screen with Quality sound!The best laptop is you are a light user, strongly suggested for Manager or any Business persons who were mostly in between calls.Not for gamersNot for Software engineers."
5,"The laptop is awesomely light in weight and doesn't compromise in performance.I have tested multiple boot on this laptop. Have done software development and ran around 10 BigData JVMs with varying memory capacity, to which the laptop still functioned quite well and supported other multitasks.Have tested this laptop with games such as GTA (till San Andreas), NFS most wanted (max graphics) and Counter strike GO.Battery life on laptop is around 9 hours for casual browsing and non-heavy tasks and around 6 hours for full brightness heavy tasks.All in all, this is a good purchase."
5,"I had an old hp 17"" pavilion laptop and was looking for a replacement. I chose LG gram 17 mainly because of the price and also of very good reviews that I had read about in Forbes and PCmag. And I am not disappointed. At Rs. 82990 it is a real bargain. The specifications and performance are consistent with what is stated in the Amazon website. The only issue that I found was with the display. The various colours appear different from other laptops. For eg red appears as dark shade of orange in LG gram. Also the battery storage capacity is overstated. It lasts only for 6-7 hours.  Another plus point is you get 3 yr warranty unlike other brands which come with only 1 yr."
5,"Purchased just 4 days back. The laptop is very light and well built.After going through multiple Reviews, I opted for 17 Inch model. All the reviews I saw are showing model with Alexa support hence purchased it.But after receiving the unit, found that Alexa support is missing on India variant which is a big let down. LG Look into this and provide support for Alexa.There are several video and questions here in which it is menioned that RAM is expandable but it is not true. RAM is not expandable."
5,Laptop withReasonably good battery lifeClass apart IPS screen. Maybe as good as Retina DisplayFast because of I7 evo processor and latest DDR4 RAM
5,"Very good screen, silent operation, very lightweight, decent battery.Good for light weight workCons-Keyboard is OK, could have been better. RAM is not upgradable."
5,Good Ezperience
5,Excellent performance and light weightWorth buying
5,"I do not think that it is possible to get another laptop at this price. I use it for regular office purpose and it is blazing fast. The batter lasts all day long for 8 hour working day (comes to 55-60% at end of day). Instant wake. Boot time is also extremely low. It is light as a feather. My earlier HP laptop was 14 inches and was much heavier.  The trackpad is centrally placed but because of the numpad (I think) it comes towards the fight of the typing keyboard. Because of this the mouse moves around a lot when typing (maybe there is no palm rejection or it does not work properly). Since I even otherwise use an external mouse, I turn off the trackpad and hence it is not an issue for me. However, for those who use the trackpad normally, it may be an issue. While the screen is high resolution, it is somehow different (unable to explain why). My earlier HP screen was much better.Overall, highly satisfied with the machine."
5,My requirement was a 17 inch with high resolution for spreadsheets and trading. I also needed it to be light weight to carry around. LG nailed it. Screen is superb. CPU Temp is between 43 to 58 (Max). Battery is around 9hrs in mixed usage.My suggestion go with 16GB Ram as Ram is soldered to the board and cannot be upgraded.Overall its a fine product.
4,Good gaming laptop in 63k range. Boots up very fast. Laptop is very fast. Screen looks awesome. Go for it
1,I have received a used product for first time and then it got replaced with much older product than that so please don't buy products from lenovo unless you want to use someone used product
4,"Well, I had to replace my 6 yr old Mac book and since mac books were out of budget, had to look at windows.Was not keen to purchase a 15 inch as I wanted a compact laptop but no company was offering the same specs as these in a 60-70k price range in 13 inch category.The deal on Lenovo was excellent and I purchased it. Using it for nearly 2 months now.The best part is the specs especially it comes with a 4GB Nvidia graphics card.The speed is fast, doesn‚Äôt heat up, battery lasts for 4-5 hours and charges very fast.However, the only issue I face is with the mousepad  of the laptop.For some reason, the mousepad in 15 inch laptops is kept more towards the left. However, other companies give left & right click button on the mousepad, Lenovo doesn‚Äôt.This causes issues while browsing or copy and one has to look at the keypad to see where the left click or right click is.Otherwise no other issues."
3,"The laptop is fair for the price it come at. Allows for decent gaming performance at decent fps. Only mention to be made here is that the cooling fans are noisy & distracting all the time you play a game. Even during video calls the fans make some hype.The 3 stars are mainly for the Lenovo service. My laptop failed to start one day & I lodged a complaint with Lenovo on the 18th of August '21 (within warranty), I get a call back from the Lenovo team on the 21st of September '21 asking for details of the problem. When I asked the engineer why is he calling after more than a month, he stopped responding altogether & I had to disconnect the call after sometime."
5,"I purchased it in offer for 52K directly without any Card offer, for that price, without any doubt this is the best laptop, you can't find these specs at this price, specially i5 10th gen with 120 Hz Refresh Rate and the keyboard is of excellent quality with 4 GB GRAPHICS.Cons are average quality front camera but you have privacy shutter, and Battery is not bad, but for normal work, it can give you around 6 Hours, but in business laptop, you can get around 10 hours for using word n ppt etc."
2,Product is not to the mark. Battery was draining quickly and speakers were growling
1,The is laptop is absolutely the worst with very weak processor . I bought it in haste and didn't think clearly while purchasing it. It's a train wreck cannot handle heavy tasks and gaming etc. It has a clear thermal management issue and thermal throttle all the time. It simply reaches 99¬∞C for simple gaming for five minutes. That's it its a disaster purchase go for ryzen any gen but not intel. These chips cannot even beat the ryzen 2-3 rd gen chips in any possible grounds
2,"I recently bought the product, and the display was too bad. I already have another Lenovo laptop, but the new one which I bought has a yellowish display. Did the nightlight OFF, colour management, and several other fixes. But no luck. Can anyone help on this regard, please"
5,Laptoo boots so fast. Looks nice and sturdy. Runs fast. Gets hot when gaming other wise for normal processing it doesn't get hot.But the battery drains too quickly. Almost to the point it is useless.
4,Good
5,"Initial impressions are good. Overall performance is good with this price range. Battery lasts for around 2-3hrs in full performance mode and for normal use, it lasts for around 4+ hrs. Design is good and can blend in as office laptop."
5,The product is good for gaming but speaker sounds during game is low so attach external speakers to it for loud üîä gaming rest all with this laptop is amazing also u can expect windows 11 home update in this laptop in October
4,"Gaming-very good,screen - excellent, camera worst.,day to day usage-smooth.battery-average.."
4,Am worried about the excessive heating up ofsystem while gaming :
3,The sound ouput is not at all meetingthe expectations. Speaker quality not suitable for online meetings or entertainment.
5,Really nice for gaming
1,"This review is based on my purchase of Microsoft Surface Pro 4. The device in itself is very useful, but it has the worst issues with respect to hardware. I have replaced 4 Surface Pro and in March-20, the device again started with flickering issue. Please note that as on today (06Aug20), the device is not yet replaced even though the company claims replacement in 7 days. It is a nightmare when you are using it as a primary device.As mentioned earlier about the device replacement, note that when it comes to customer service, it is worst in India. the toll free number as usual never connects & if you chat, agents are sitting out of India and they don't know anything about service centers in India. The service center does not offer any help at all.Please do not waste money in this device. You may check out via normal google search about the issues with Surface devices. There will hardly be any positive comment."
1,m3 processor is still better at that price. intel gold processor at 55000 rupees is too much for it.
1,Pathetic pricing
1,different product received it ipad inMicrosoft box
4,"This is surface go 2.. some mix up in the descriptionDevice is awesome. Premium feel.Charges fast. Speed is good. No lag even with 10 tabs open in Microsoft edge browser with few other applications open. Can't jump to other apps easily in android tab or an ipad. Still using s mode. So no Google apps, no Adobe reader. Restricted app store. Type c port doesn't charge.My needs fulfilled."
1,"It's a waste of money. You cannot use it for most common purposes like installing google chrome, kindle app etc let alone programming. Disabling the S of the Windows heats up the device and makes it slow. Since it cannot be returned, need to find how to use it."
2,"Update # 1 september. The device is already dead and sent for warranty repair leaving my all my works pending.Poor choice my fault.... touch interface is not at all intuitive. To close a browser tab have to press 4 - 5 times. The default sleep option is horrible. It sometimes requires a reset as one click on the power button after sleep won't turn it on. Many may panic and think the PC is dead. The PC gets heating up horribly if you run any graphics related apps (even thr normal ones). And who uses DDR III at after 2019. Its madness. To top it all, windows 10 keeps releasing updates almost every week or fortnight squeezing every bit of your net pack. The only silver lining is its weight and portability. Constrained to buy windows PC for the sole reason that it supports productive apps more than other OS platforms. My bad."
1,"Exchange offer never works.. I mean never. I've tried twice to exchange with my Surface pro 2 i5. It's in excellent working condition. But pick up boy will just cancel. Once pick up boy just canceled without even coning to me. They're worried, in  the office they might get rejected. Very bad systems. Microsoft is giving us the opportunity to exchange and upgrade but Amazon is not able to execute the exchange transition.  I was barred to give reviews for surface. I've got 3 surface so far. I'm used to it that's the only reason I'm in to it..."
1,The product stopped working after 1 month of use. And neither Microsoft nor Amazon did anything about it. They just raised their hands and they said they can‚Äôt help me. I am so disappointed and I regret buying this product and from Amazon
1,God know why we bought this. Pathetic item and utter waste of money.. no good apps in this so can‚Äôt use like Apple or android tabs.Heating issue.Windows on small screen is no use for office work.So overall since we have bought this. Kept as display only and rarely used. Don‚Äôt go by YouTube video bloggers.. this is utter waste even for frequent travellers who works outside office.
5,"Price worthy. I don't think anyone should compare it with I pad air or samsung galaxy tab s6 , as all of them have different operating systems. One who is not very much fond of gaming may purchase it over others."
5,"The size, weight and speed are all just right- especially if you are able to supplement it with the keyboard that comes separately. I was not able to see much utility for the pen, which I had bought as well- it has also been a little more difficult to learn to use. No regrets on any front."
4,Its a product for students it is easy to use and It is smooth. Overall a nice product.
5,Works really well for me as I wanted a tablet that can also be a laptop on demand...
5,It‚Äôs the most trendy utilitarian device that you can ever get
2,My Laptop mic problem..sound not clear
5,Wow Superb as per my need
4,Did not get the latest processor and LTE
1,"this is not surface go 2,surface go 2 is 10.5 inch display"
1,"If microsoft wants their product to be a hit, then they have to price it same as usa pricing. Otherwise in india it will be a big flop."
3,"Cons-1- This laptop is way too expensive for a Pentium‚Ñ¢ gold Processor.2- The Sound is ok , but not the best.3- I would recommend to buy the ""Asus Vivobook Flip 14"" if you do want the touch screen4- The 64Gb storage model has EEMC storage , which is extemely slow.5- The screen is very small for a laptop.6- Not good for Programing .Pros-1- The Webcam is One of the best at this price.2- The battery life is Great.3- The screen quality is very nice.4- The surface pen works great5- The colour is nice6- Very portable"
1,Microsoft surface series is the worst that you can ever buy.I have a surface pro4 and the screen flickering issue is so bad that you can't work on it for more than 2 hours.If you want a cool looking device just to show off and not work on.. go for it. But if you really want a gadget to use... Just don't buy any product from Microsoft.
1,Go for lenovo flex or hp envy if possible .this product should be priced around 30-35k.Bad product from Microsoft
1,"Don't buy this. This laptop is being sold at a premium of almost 15k in India when compared to the US price. No idea who thought that was a good idea. You can import it for cheaper. Seriously, skip it."
1,No keyboard why u r calling it as laptop? Laptop consists of keyboard. It us just accessories.Go for many orherbrand far better than this
5,"Good product, but the accessories are hard to find in local market. Battery life is good 8hr or so."
1,"My six year old machine works better, with less nonsense! Noisy and awful and I‚Äôve had to run diagnostics twice in less than four weeks, and the tech support team is always ‚Äúhandling multiple cases‚Äù so each response is after ten minutes.And I have had to speak to dell support almost once a week and reinstall the OS twice. It is disgusting"
2,All spec's r super but battery life is very poor only 2 hours life

1,Such a good laptop design and specs spoiled with a bad quality display. Its only 48% srgb. Missing many colours and vibrancy.plz check the screen colours with different videos before buying it. Buy it if you can accept the display limitations. Bcz you pay your hard earned money. Thank me later.
4,"Nice performance, very thin and comfortable. Pre installed windows home and ms office limited time validity drawback.ProsNvida graphic card 2 gb inbuilt.Touchpad very nice performance8gb ram11th generationCos512 ssd onlyLittlebit high price for comparision other companyOverall good product"

5,its good and compatible
4,Nice product

5,Very good purchase..Working goodSpeed is also good
4,Anti glare
5,Great laptop to use
5,value for money
2,Battery life is very low
4,Very good product
1,Disappointment üòî. This laptop have no backlit keyboard
4,Excellent laptop for the price. Doesn't have backlit keyboard as mentioned in the description.  It's misleading..... the answers given to the questions are conflicting....Amazon should ensure correct description is given
4,"Light weight,nice design but has no cd drive and also doesn't come with a bag.Also there is no licensed ms-office given in this laptop"
5,"Value product , good features"
5,"This laptop is perfect for home and student use. Don't get blindsided by the negative reviews. The item arrives in sturdy packaging which prevents it from damage during transit. I myself use this laptop for university online meetings. This laptop is not meant for high graphics gaming, low-resolution games are compatible. Rest assured is fine.Benefits:- Heat: No heating issue. While charging only the charging adapter and battery gets warm which is quite normal.- Charging time: Gets charged in 2hr 30mn (0-100). Playback time (normal usage)- 4 hrs.- Boot time: 10 secs switch-on & switch-off.- Writing speed: USB 3.0 (output to input) gives 80-120 Mbps writing speed.- Display: FHD display, Antiglare display lets you stream Netflix, Youtube & many more from any angle of the laptop.- Sound: Based on a laptop system, the sound is quite good. I hear music at volume 40/100.- Touchpad: smooth.- Pre-activated Office 2019.Note:- Purchase a Saco silicon keyboard cover (black) as the visibility of the default key prints in daylight are not so efficiently visible.- As shown in picture, the laptop must be kept above any plain hard surface so that the air circulation keeps running and does not gets heated.- In many reviews, you will find that the laptop is getting heated, the worst laptop and all. But one must know how to use it properly.- At first, I was thinking of purchasing the same model only with Ryzen 3 4300U processor. But I changed my decision and stuck to this only. Because as compared to 4300U, in this laptop 3250U one gets 15.6 Screen, RJ-45 Port, 1TB HDD, calculator keyboard.- Don't confuse yourself with the processors, someone will say quad-core is better than dual-core, and don't purchase this laptop as it is dual-core. But trust me for home and student basic usage, this laptop is more than enough.- If one plays a game or performs multi-high tasking software, then the laptop fan runs at high speed which is a bit noisy. But don't worry its normal only.- DDR4 2400 mghz is sufficient for a student and basic office meetings use.- Do check the warranty on HP's official website by entering the serial number which is present at the laptop base or product box.That's all folks!!!"
5,One of the best product at this price....
4,Very good .... After use of 9 months (updated)
5,"Best laptop under 40k. 1TB HDD, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM, Ryzen 3.No matter how much dig in you wont find these specifications in any other brand at this price."
1,Video Player is loading.
1,"MS Teams hangs when the camera is switched on. Very bad product for online classes. When all the children turn on their video together, MS Teams hangs and we have to do a hard reboot. Not sure if this is a problem with AMD or configuration. As far as I know, 8GB RAM should work good, but this laptop does not. We replaced it twice with Amazon and still the issue is not resolved."
2,Repeatedly this Hangs. Processor is very bad. I dont have much applications installed yet it hangs.Not at all value for money..waste of moneyPosting after a month of use
5,"The product is really good for its price.Pros:1. IPS display + anti-glare, great for media consumption!2. Ssd + Hdd, enough storage!3. Free Ms. Office for lifetime4. Ryzen 3 is good enough for studying and office work.5. Type C port6. Looks extremely elegant.Cons:1. No backlit keyboard.2. The performance would be better if it had Ryzen 5. (But its quite fast because of the ssd)3. Built Quality could be better. Also, the laptop being 15.6"", is quite heavy compared to 14"" laptops.4. Laptop cameras and speakers are never great but they get the job done.The laptop is working as expected. Not a gaming laptop but extremely good for study purpose- online classes, reading books, web browsing. It's amazing for watching movies and web series! The Ssd makes the laptop fast. I am extremely happy with the purchase. :)"
1,"I bought this laptop for remote schooling of kids. Observed that 10 mins into microsoft teams, the video freezes. The audio continues. But at this time, the entire laptop is in hung state. There is no option other than hard reboot. It's is not supporting TEAMS"
1,"Purchased 1 month back. Cons below:Hangs while using microsoft meeting. Everytime you try to share screen and it hangs. I feel cheated after purchasing it now, don‚Äôt buy this model."
1,"Laptop has only 2 USB PORTS that too much closer to each other so as we can't use both of them at once.You can not insert any 2 usb devices at once be it mouse, PAN Drive or USB Cable, there is no gap space between both the ports. Using both the ports at once is impossible. If using both at once is not possible, why the company has provided to USB Ports.Absolutely disappointed and frustrated."
1,"Doesn't reach expectionsGo for i3 Processor only. Hangs a lot, Sound quality is worst & you can not return it, body material plastic, usb Ports is very Cheap quality,Honest reviewPlease don't Buy It..."
5,"Very good product in 40k range , if u want to buy for study and office purpose just go for it.Better build quality , and most important in 40k range no other companies provides IPS pannel display so, its awsome"
1,Received damaged laptop and it has been two weeks that I have been trying to get it replaced or returned. The Amazon pick up person has come 6-7 times now and each time they have a new excuse for not picking up the damaged product. The customer care service has also been absolutely useless. They keep reassuring that pick up will be done tomorrow but the same cycle keeps repeating and it has been two weeks now. The pick up person also does not pick up the calls now. Do not buy such a high value product on amazon. There is no customer service at all and I am now stuck with a damaged laptop.
1,Dear Team HPI purchased this laptop on 3rd July 2021. But warranty says it's valid only upto 13th June 2022. Can you please check and resolve?? Once I get the resolution I will share my complete review
1,"I got this laptop on 7-May  , we  use it only for online classes and no other software is installed  .  Every now and then , The laptop just stops working and hangs , happens atleast twice a day . Please do not buy this model."
1,"Always Online Products are having issues, after spending huge money for laptop we are not getting perfect item ,  this laptop mic is not working properly ,even creating disturbance to others while online calls ,  it is hampering online classes and meetings . My Voice not Audible to others ."
1,I purchased this 2 weeks back to use it for online schooling purpose. MS Teams and zoom frequently freezes laptop during meetings. I had to force the shut down to use it again .HP technicians unable to fix the problem. I am looking to return this.update after 2 months .. Issue is not yet resolved ... HP support team is unable to fix it.
4,Anti-glare quality is good although there is slight bit lack in screen brightness .....nd off course u can play games except if played in higher setting it get heatup nd fan sound high.....Overall it is worth buying in this price ....
1,"I bought this laptop and after 1 week usage writing this....Don't buy this laptop, it will hang frequently, it can not handle minimum application, if you open teams and attend meeting it will hang, you need to restart...that is only the option.."
5,"I was satisfied with the overall performance and speed of the laptop.  It works well with the WiFI at home and has all the requisite software needed for online classes.  The sound is especially clear with headphones.  The webcam is quite good and is sufficient for attending meetings and online classes.However, if you need to know in advance, the laptop does not have a BACKLIT keyboard.  It does not appear to be suited for serious gaming purposes.Thank You Amazon for the superb quality of packaging and prompt delivery."
5,"I got this laptop from amazon for 41.3 K INR. I searched for many laptops in this price range but did not find many who were offering the SSD+HDD combination with 8GB RAM and preinstalled windows and office softwares. I am using the Ryzen based system for the 1st time. The configuration offered in this price range is really great.I am using this laptop for a week now and mostly do normal computing activities, web browsing, watching movies etc. The booting up and shutting down are really fast...around 20 secs. The sound, display and battery backup are also good. The laptop is new now and lets see how things go with time. I think it is really worth buying this product and will recommend it.If it is helpful, I would like to mention one more point that while buying I had opted for exchanging my old laptop  to get some discount... amazon was offering 9.75K flat discount.  But since my old laptop was damaged a little in the hinge area and the laptop plastic body, the exchange offer got cancelled totally later during pick up."
1,"I useing a laptop since 1 months but the problem is my laptop automatically hang at time of work, so also if I play music some  frucal problem, that's why don't like"
1,"New laptop not switching on.I am quitely disappointed.Dear HP improve your quality check and testing system before product reaches market and customerPoorest service by Amazon.I ordered,  defective laptop delivered, ordered for replacement,Wantedly miscommunication between delivery boy and technical person.Customer care executive made me helpless.Asked to cancel order and return.Amazon team made me to miss bank offer,Poorest service of Amazon,Amazon is not customer centric."
1,Defective peice wifi not working properly
2,"I got this laptop for my kid's remote schooing. The laptop hangs with Microsoft Teams video calling. Everytime it hangs need to reboot the system. For all the AMD processor and the bells & whistles of speed, it could not handle a simple Teams video call.Additionally i found a slight dent on one side."

5,I like its processor and SSD Which make it easy  easy to work and key light also make it awesome and easy to work at night or any time.  Windows 11 is now available to use by upgrading it. I would like to suggest to the guys who has not heavy to do with laptop just go for i3 processor only because it's not comfortable for coding to do or heavy game to play.

4,It's a very good laptop for basic computer tasks and media consumption thanks to its OLED display. I upgraded to windows 11 which btw is free. The only con with this laptop is it's battery life. If you are ok with your laptop plugged in most of the time then it shouldn't be a problem. Final verdict. Recommended at this price.

5,"I was bit skeptical before ordering it , not because of the specs but for the build quality. Once I received it , all of my confusions went away, the build is sturdy, perfectly suits a gaming laptop look, MSI tried to give it a bit of Alienware look!!Every piece of hardware is superb!! I can bet if you want to buy these specs, it would cost you 95k almost.Just a small complain - about the speaker volume, it could have been a bit louder, but its ok, the sound quality is sweet and smooth and rich, that outweighs the volume loudness. :)"
5,"I was scared to ordered this laptop because there was only single purchased and 0 reviews but I took a risk and now I am happy on my decision as it is true beast . The only con that I feel is the back of the laptop , as the cut design is not visible properly as shown on pics."
5,"I was bit skeptical before ordering it , not because of the specs but for the build quality. Once I received it , all of my confusions went away, the build is sturdy, perfectly suits a gaming laptop look.Every piece of hardware is superb!! I can bet if you want to buy these specs, it would cost you 95k almost."
5,nice
5,Purchased a HP ZBook. The workstation is working fine the seller also sought a feedback after delivery. Prompt response and support
4,"Laptop has really good performance, pretty good built, sound, camera etc everything. The only issue is dell has given heating vent at back, I dont know why, though din't notice any heating issue but slight heating, side vent would have been better for sure. Rest performance wise its a  good laptop."
3,"This is basically an entertainment laptop. It can handle videos beautifully. If compared to other laptops of same price band, then it is a waste of money as other laptops offer Nvidia GTX series graphics card in this same or even lesser price.Paying on hoax of 11 generation processor is not worth it."
5,I saw a stupid reviewer saying it's better to go with laptops with gtx cards and not 11th gen i5.what that fool doesn't know is that this is a thin and light laptop where battery life matters the most.And this gives  a solid 8-9 hours battery on power saver mode.
5,Look no further. Brand Dell says it all. Excellent laptop for Work from home and learn from home.
1,Worst battery performance and build quality is below average
1,Not the best at the price point and the performance is also not that great
3,"Don't buy for gaming this lap is good mid range games and software, ram need to upgrade for smooth performance.Pos:It's excellent for watching movie with highqaiity soundUsing headphone you feel theatre experienceDisplay is goodDesign is too goodCons:Not for gamingBattery drain quicklyMaximum 16gb ram upgrade"
5,Good laptop for office use can last long time in terms of battery life. It would be good if asus had provided option for micro sd card and ram expansion options for future purpose. Other than that its is very good laptop I got for 16k on Amazon great festival with exchange of old laptop and bank offer Good deal over allüôÇ
5,"The thing I like about it is having light weight and ovearall good package for non gamers,best for office work"
1,Purchased this Laptop last week and not happy with performance.Cons1. Booting issue. It takes long time to open in spite of latest BIOS version updated2. Takes long time to load any apps/browser. Very slow3. Battery backup is very poor. Hardly lasts for 1.5 hours after 100% charge4. This laptop is made out of China and comes with hardly very cheap manual of just 2 or pages sheet. Doesn't look Dell quality. I didn't expect that such cheap product from Dell
2,"Ordered this product from amazon as dell categories this model under business and delivery time is 1 month. So went with high end config of I5, 11th Gen, 8GB mem and 1TB HDD but it was very shocking package received was damaged and box was already opened or used. The performance of the product is very poor and it take long time to show-up the login screen and any application performance is very bad. Also extending the dell warranty is nightmare as there is no response from Dell for this product finally the quote was quite higher than the original purchase E.g if you order thru dell extending additional 2 year of warranty is around 1999 but if you do it separate it cost around 5000 . So purchased additional 500GB of WD NVME and made the system boost ending up spending 55k for this product without extended warranty which is quite expensive for this model"
5,"I received a faulty laptop first, then I spoke with Amazon executive and they helped me to get an another one as replacement ""Thanks Amazon"". It's been less than a week since i have been using this laptop, so far i don't see any issues and works fine as described & expected. The battery backup is very good and look wise also it's good."
1,"The laptop provides a good specification but they are really cheap and inefficient. To consider an example the Core i5 11th generation performs poorly than a Core i5 8th generation. The HDD also performs really bad especially while booting. The booting time varies between 2 mins to 5 mins. That's too long considering the pace of technology and the price of the product, almost 50k. It's sad that Dell is producing cheaper thousands of cheaper, worthless variants in the market rather than used to have a couple of awesome variants in past. So, be careful while buying, and DO NOT BUY THIS ONE.** Also Amazon.in has a bad return policy and they won't take it back."
4,"My daughter has been using it from last few week for her online classes.The laptop have only 1 drive which is HDD so boot time is little longer.Otherwise every thing is working fine.The build quality is good,trackpad function is smooth.The body has a mat finish and give an elegant look.14 inch screen,11th generation intern core i5.This was the cheapest model with above configuration ."
1,This product makes too much noise if the fan which is strange as well as there is no easy replacement policy of this product.When I asked to replace it within 7days they asked me to schedule technician visits instead of replacement or return .
5,Good features quite fast battery backup is also sufficient and enough. Can be a better option for anyone below 50k
1,"Very slow to boot up and also slow while loading applications, frequent firmware updates(every two days) and have done at least 3 times since I bought it in a space of one week. The laptop shows a blank dark screen after reboot and then i need to shut down and restart again multiple times. Frustrated after a week's use and returning the product."
1,Not worth money. The laptop didn‚Äôt boot up after 4 long hrs of installation. The product will only be replaced & no returns accepted and every time after replacement the customer should pay installation charges which costs around 800 bucks. Ideal to buy expensive items at authorised stores.
1,Laptop speed is slow ... It's getting stuck ..taking more times for open and speed is not good ... Pls üôè don't purchase this laptop ..bad experience this lappi
1,Poor quality and never advised for this product. With the same cost lots of peer companies give good quality product.
2,The system speed is extremely slow. I made a complaint on 25th Feb. I was told that system will be replaced within 48 hours. It is already more than one week but my system has not been replaced.
4,"I like it's build quality, display,camera , but because of 1tb HDD speed is little bit slow but acceptable. Good for gaming intact higher gaming but the hot winds coming out position can be improved."
1,It is worst lapotop don't wast money..I think sellar is worst I buy this laptop on 11th August now Oct 15 this I get the the problem and it is very slow worst laptop plz don't buy it and it not working properly
1,"Worse Laptop I have ever seen, not worthy product even system was not fast even it's don't have any data. Don't put investment on this laptop."

1,Piece is defective. Send query for replacement.
2,Performance is too slow
1,Don't buy this product. It's performance is not great.
2,Its very slow
2,Laptop Performance is Very Poor.
4,"Camera quality is badGood booting speed, u will feel the differenceSome keys are compromised on the keyboard cause small size but that's not a big problemOverall it's amazing laptop ü§©ü§©"
5,Overall laptop justify its price but I noticed lacked space it would be atleast 512ssd instead 256ssd storage. Another thing is about camera that seems very poor. In term of performance it is best
3,Camera and battery life can be better. Rest all is very nice and smooth.
5,"Superb quality.. great speed.. initially I found it some glitches like hanging but after update, it became fine..So fast and quick finger print recognise.. smooth to access.., having good storage..if u r buying for gaming u may face problem with battery,.. overall it's worth for money u give."
5,Laptop is so light weight to use and its used as a daily driver for work from Home. It has amazing battery life can go up to 4+ hours on battery.. Do get a minor issue of WIFI Dis-connectivity some times maybe a issue with Windows or Laptop don't know..Apart from that its a great laptop just great for working on the go. Can use a USB converter For Internet cable works great.Great Color Just gonna mention...
4,"I bought this product through amazon laptop exchange offer , so i returned my asus X555L laptop which was almost 5 years old in exhange. Exchange process was very smooth , delivery excecutive checked general laptop condition and then checked the configuration and was satisfied and handed over my new laptop.Laptop is good , smooth running laptop, not at all gaming laptop as VRAM is just 128MB, so not recommeneded for gamers. But if u need laptop for work or personal use , its a good deal , with 2.3Ghz i5 11 gen processor , 8 gb Ram , 1tB Hdd its a good deal. Speed is good. Overall 4/5 .Cons: not for gaming, speaker are not very loud, battery backup is average, no dvd drive."
5,Overall  performance good...but battery need to upgrade
1,"I want to 0 starts to this product3 months ago, I buy this laptop with 1 year warranty after that i faced to many errors in this laptop (blue screen error, screen problems, speaker problems,troubleshoot errors, etc). Also i don't get any home service by ASUS. Thats why, i will never recommend this product to anyone."
4,"I purchased this after lot of thinking. But it is not that good or not that bad. Satisfaction level 80%.Pros:Looks,  speed, screenCons:Battery life, in Amazon description it says 8 hours but in reality getting 4 hoursKeyboard looks cheaperCheap quality Plastic at the bottom and hand restWindows 10 home is not upgradable to Pro"
3,"Execept the battery life and thermal issues the laptop performs good. If you're okay with worst battery life (can drain 100% - 0% under 1hr) and can bear some heat, go for it! Choose if you want expandable option."
3,"The one disadvantage of this laptop is that there is no LAN port. If your have a LAN connection and want to connect, the only way is via a router."
3,"Pros:-Backlit chicklet keyboard-Display decent enough and bright up to 250 nits-SSD speed and RAM is decent user benchmark results will tell you that-i311th Gen 8GB RAM-No fan noiseCons:-3-4 hours of battery backup-Poor built quality, plastic body case-Heats up like anything on minimal use advisable to use with laptop table-Graphics not up to the mark-Keyboard is dust prone-Trackpad freezes after long hours of working"
5,"I have used it for one month.. System is very smooth.. Good webcam.. I am using this for attending online class.. So about gaming, i have no idea. I haven't installed any games till now.. Rest is superb..."
1,"I purchased 2 months back and used weekly 2-3 times, (only normal use). Yesterday i was watching a movie, after 15 mins time the laptop was dead, then i put charging to it, but it didn't charging .... so what can i do?, without proper checking by Amazon it genuine or not sold to customers is a fraud, I lost my money and time. Waste product i got from ASUS"
1,"Taken the laptop 4 months back, it was tottaly shutdown immediately when i informed they came checked and informed liquid is available, motherboard has gone. Repair charges is around 32000/-which is almost 50% cost of laptop.We have not touched not even a single drop of water but how liquid has come this is because of failure in any parts fluid inside the laptop which they are not accepting.Customer care is very inexperience, no tracking of our complaints, really it is a worst company. Please don't go with ASUS company, Don't keep any faith on this company ASUS.If you want to take Blood pressure then you go with this.."
5,Received the ultra book and Within 1/2 hr the touch pad stopped working. Immediately called Amazon customer service and they sent a technician a day later to review the problem. A new replacement laptop is now on the way.I have read horror stories with defective items arriving and customers are stuck without replacements so I was a bit worried.
3,All things are ok there is space/slot for 2.5 inch ssd/hdd But there is no kit is provided to attach ssd/hdd. why  ? And this is too disappointing ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
4,1. MS Office is only for a month. Please read the word Pre installed.2. Keyboard light is low.3. Battery back is 2.5 to 3 hrs only.Rest everything is fantastic

5,"Loved the product. I got it for 42,490 rs and in this price bracket its the best!!!!  Good for office use and students. Fits for all normal use."
4,everything about this laptop is great. just the battery that im upset with. its not ideal for a laptop to charge after every few hours of usage. even if im doing just normal stuff like surfing or playing video the battery lasts maximum 3hrs.
1,"Stopped working on 3rd day, won't boot with black screen. Suspect it might be a dead SSD.Returns/replacment/refund for laptops are a headache, need a lot of patience."
4,"Pro: design, fast booting with SSD, fingerprint access works good and fast.Cons: display panel is bit loose. 1.8 kg."
2,"Amazon is trusted brand... We trust it blindly, then why we suffer from cheat... In box packed laptop HDD adapter / connector missing, how can customer upgrade 1 tb HDD to laptop. It's impossible to work with 196gb space."
5,It's so amazing. I can't expect anything better than this laptop in this price. You should go for it!! üëçüèª
1,Laptop is not good and doesn't work properly üò°
5,"This laptop is a problem allrounder. Perfect for multitasking. The fast charging and huge battery backup is excellent. It is an Absolute beauty, especially the blue colour"
5,You won't regret.

5,It is very good laptop and full package in this range.
4,"It's battery life is very bad in my consideration, look wise and in configuration it is very good if some wants it for daily use and can keep it plugged in then it good to use ."
1,"Please check the details very carefully, they dont deliver what they show, in my laptop version it was mentioned micr SSD card with picture to support it, they gave me a model  with no SD card i raised a complain they promised for with the SD card model, they send me another one now with no SD card and one version lower, I cant under stand it. this is my model number - ASUS VivoBook15-X515EA-BQ312TS and you can see in picture attached it`s 300 and not 312 what they have given. 256 GB mentioned 238 GB given."
4,"Review for seller - 0/5 for sending laptop with trial version of MS office. SD card reader not given as claimed in details.Review for Amazon - 5/5 Customer care person helped, took all the pains to resolve and replace the laptop.Review for Asus: It's my 2nd laptop from Asus (1st one is 14""). I found Asus built quality superior than Lenovo. Finger print scanner is quite useful. Display is satisfactory. Bezels are thin. Keyboard is soft and responsive though backlit is missing. Go for i5 11th gen if you are buying laptop for video editing, gaming or performing heavier tasks.Review for laptop - Average medium range laptop for student and light official work. If you need better laptop then you should go for i5 laptops and spend at least 55-60k."
4,"Everything is really nice but first i would like to point out the problem of amazon delivery service, the delivery itself was really good but deliveryman was so feared that he delivered the parcel at 10:30 pm and yes pm at night. Amazon should treat its workers with a little ease. Talking about the product first impressions are good works really fast but it lacks out the battery power. I'll update the rest of the review after some use."
4,Battary quality is not good . Drains so fast.  Other wise display is good and good for office workers and students

4,"Using it for over a month now. Satisfied with the purchase. Putting down the pros and cons basis my experience and personal preferences:Pros:1. Light weight. Looks elegant and sturdy. Outer body of screen is of aluminum.2. Keys are well placed and feels nice to type. No key noise while typing.3. Boot time really fast, 5-7 secs. Fingerprint works accurately.4. Full charged battery easily lasts for 6-7 hours with normal use.. my daughters does her online classes and battery lasts for around 4+ hours easily. It takes around 1.5 hours for full battery charge.5. Backlit keyboard with 2 different brightness levels.6. Laptop comes with lifetime free edition of MS Office.7. Sound is pretty loud. No complains.8. Web cam quality is average. Neither very good nor bad. Cons:1. Color reproduction is not nice. So this is definitely not for those whose primary requirement is colour accuracy... Like photography, content creation, graphics etc. Ok many websites, the colour of the images, icons comes out dull. I miss the sharpness and colour saturation.2. Sharpness of text is missing. Someone else also had mentioned similar feedback.3. There was a problem with my Bluetooth connectivity wherein it was not getting connected with phone, though was able to connect with other Bluetooth devices. Raised a complain and Lenovo team sent an engineer who replaced the wifi cum Bluetooth chip and now it works fine."
4,"bought this on the same day of launch. update the review after 2 months of usage:booting so fast (within 5-7 seconds),accurate fingerprint,windows home edition (can upgrade to pro freely, if you know how to ;-),lifetime office license,good performance,good battery life (6-7 hours for moderate usage),and everything is nice.there is few drawbacks:missing ethernet port,missing hdd cable - FRU part:5C10S30033 (so you can't upgrade storage eventhough there is a place for additional hdd),no upgradable ram,worst lenovo support.worth for 50-55k price range."
1,"I purchased this laptop thinking it would last me 7 years, when I can barely last 7 days with it. I'm a designer who needs colour accurate screens but this screen is not color accurate. The middle laptop in the photo is the lenovo laptop purchased. When I visited the lenovo centre they said that there was nothing wrong with it. The customer care of Lenovo is of no help either. They're refusing to help fix this issue and they're not even providing a denial letter so i can get my money back. I'm stuck with this product but you don't have to. Dont purchase.(other aspects of the laptop are fine, but a screen is important to me and that is something that's not getting fixed. And Lenovo's attitude towards this issue is a bummer. Dont buy Lenovo anywhere)"
3,"Its mentioned that there are USB 3.0 ports available are 3, but in fact only 2 are available. Could Lenovo or the seller clarify why.Also there is no mention of whether the RAM can be expanded."

4,I was looking for a light weight laptop which could provide longs battery backup. This is my first AMD Ryzen based laptop and it didn't disappoint me. With long battery backup which lasts about 8 hours on noraml office work it also have a good image and video quality.  The only small thing that bother me is color accuracy on certain websites and application which is not a good experience.  The laptop is not recommended to professional in image editing business.
3,"yesterday i receved the laptop but the laptop screen was defected.it has a black  vertical line on the middle of the laptop which was annoying,so after i got a replacement.now the laptop works fine but the buit quality is not upto level actually the laptop was shaking and the hinge can broken easily.carefully open and close the laptop.apart from these this laptop is mindblowing.dont think more just grab it now.faq:-1.is the ram upgradable?ans. no,the ram is soldered2.average battery life?ans.9-8 hors3.laptop is good for gaming?ans.yes better than the gaming laptop4.screen quality:-not good at all."
5,"The laptop is fabulus. Speed is awesome, finger print sensor, weight, backlit key board and other features are also perfect. But only one thing to mention, there is only 2 USB port whereas in product specification it is mentioned 3. I have to purchase usb hub. Otherwise its a superb buy. No one is offering such specifications in this price range."

5,"Execellent Product, Great performance...!!"
1,"Please avoid buying this lenovo laptop. After weeks of research I finally felt I should take a chance and get AMD powered lenovo laptop. But to my disappointment, this is the worst possible laptop that I ever invested such a huge amount it. The display had a pixel defect within the 1st month of the purchase, after 3 weeks and 2 twitter escalations they finally replaced my screen and now I have frequent brightness problems with the laptop display. I am unable to experience the hardware the laptop comes with due to very poor display quality. This laptop is worse than the cheapest china product possible.The laptop charge overheats, very very poor support in case of assistance required and for the money spent, this is not at all worth it. You better scout for more options but not this laptop.Laptop is heavy, the 8 GB RAM is unresponsive sometimes leading to additional wait time to switch tabs between google chrome browser. It's not just me, but many have faced this issue. Lenovo is just not good at making premium products.My verdict, avoid this laptop. It's not worth the money and it will give up during the time you least expect and you can't do anything about it as support is also like 2-3 weeks duration long."
5,"Look is great. Build quality is sturdy. Performance is as expected. Battery backup though varies between 6-8 hrs depending on usage for the ryzen 5 5500u model....over all I am satisfied.Also the haselfree exchange of old product made me a huge fan of Amazon unlike flipkart who were offering 1800 for same laptop after inspection, and Amazon exchanged for more than 9000"
4,"Sturdy build quality. 5500u performs as advertised. Audio is clear and just about loud. Setting up office-19 was a bit of a hassle given the office 365 pop-ups. Can handle gaming at medium settings. Thermal management is pretty average. For the price, still a pretty good deal."
4,"I have this system from last 20 days so it will be premature to comment ,but so far it works smoothly ,boot time is fast no overheating but need to work on system to provide full review.FYI it take dust particles so need to keep it clean"

1,I got a faulty product the charger wasn‚Äôt working and i ordered the 1tb 256ssd variant but i got 512ssd variant delivered which was faulty even thou on my invoice it mentioned the 1tb variant.
5,For gaming and productivity this is hell of a beast in this price range. Aah and yeah battery is not too good but it can easily survive for approx 2:30 hr of normal usage. And at first I got deffective piece but got replaced in 2-3 days which is impressive. Not writting long but at last  wanna say that its value for money. :D
5,Best gaming laptop in this range even after long hours of gaming it does not get much heated like the other laptops.  The display is amazing for gaming. Does not get heated fast can play for 3 to 4 hours without it getting heated.  Comfortable keyboard for gaming. The battery life is excellent for gaming laptop. I thought my charger was not working so I got in touch with the customer care and they were super helpful resolved my issue immediately actually the charger had to be pushed all the way it is a double push when it connects we hear a click sound.
5,"Make sure u insert the charger jack properly, u need to press it hard. Nak pichal pack aipoinai on kakapote."

5,Super for gaming and editing

3,"Amazon Purchasing Experience: I ordered the product on Prime Exclusive ""Great Indian Festival Sale 2021"" (when the sale starts exclusively for Prime Members). I was hoping that Prime Members are paying more, hence they should get the best deal. But, I was wrong. If I would have waited for the sale to open to all the customers, then I would have saved Rs.3000. I was a regular customer of Amazon and have always preferred it over other platforms. But, this order changed everything. Here, I made 2 mistakes. That means I was wrong to purchase the Prime membership first and then purchasing on the Prime Exclusive Day. Hence, I will never ever purchase Prime.Product Review: I am writing this review after about 14 days of usage. The specs can be looked at in the description. So, I will tell about the problems only. The keyboard spacing is not good. You will need time to get used to it. I am a programmer by profession. So, even though I know the key placements, typing errors are frequent. Touchpad's build quality doesn't look good. You need to pick up the laptop with both hands, otherwise, some issues arise (like fan making noise). This laptop attracts dust, so need some measures for that also. The battery is average (wouldn't have expected much as it is a performance-oriented laptop and 60Hz minimises the battery consumption). Many times, only 2 USB ports can be used (has 3 ports, but 2 are very close). The power point at the back also creates an issue (one needs to be extra cautious while charging). Sometimes, it gets heated even while using a browser and a media player and file explorer opened. So, it is an average product under Rs.75k(as I was fooled to pay more because I was a Prime member)."

1,"I am highly disappointed with the product, the first time I got a faulty product it did not even start, after replacement the second one which was suppose to be 1 TB HDD but was only 500 GB.misleading information on the Amazon page.Waiting for my refund and return. I do not TRUST them anymore."
1,I purchased an acer laptop (AN 515-57) but when I tried to register it online  I am not able to do so the the product serial number in product is just of 18 letters where on acer site it show the serial number is of 22 letters and also SNID is not showing for this product as of which I am not register it for warranty. Also acer executive told me to return this product as it is having some issue and it is not a genuine product.#buy_at_your_own_risk #fake #beaware
5,one of the best thermals out there intels new Alder Lake CPU with Nvidia RTX 3050 for smooth gamingpersonally using it and liked it so muchJust add another ssd for even better performance
5,"- I am using this laptop for about 15 days and if you need a future-proof laptop then this is the one.- The best part is the thermal system of this laptop, literally, this laptop doesn't heat up which definitely extends the life your laptop.- Almost all software available in the market is optimized to give the best performance with Intel processors and here you got the latest 11 generation intel i5 Hexa core processor.- The build quality is best, the design is awesome and the performance is powerful.- The typing experience you will get on this laptop is simply fabulous, better than Legion and Tuf laptop.- You can easily open the laptop lid with a single hand.- I use MATLAB and some CAD Softwares on this laptop which works very smoothly without any issue.- The battery life is not that good as it is a gaming laptop. It lasts around 3 to 4 hrs for multitasking and heavy work.- Recently, I have upgraded my laptop to windows 11 which is working fine.- The battery life is not that good as it is a gaming laptop."
1,I got a faulty product the charger wasn‚Äôt working and i ordered the 1tb 256ssd variant but i got 512ssd variant delivered which was faulty even thou on my invoice it mentioned the 1tb variant.
5,For gaming and productivity this is hell of a beast in this price range. Aah and yeah battery is not too good but it can easily survive for approx 2:30 hr of normal usage. And at first I got deffective piece but got replaced in 2-3 days which is impressive. Not writting long but at last  wanna say that its value for money. :D
5,Best gaming laptop in this range even after long hours of gaming it does not get much heated like the other laptops.  The display is amazing for gaming. Does not get heated fast can play for 3 to 4 hours without it getting heated.  Comfortable keyboard for gaming. The battery life is excellent for gaming laptop. I thought my charger was not working so I got in touch with the customer care and they were super helpful resolved my issue immediately actually the charger had to be pushed all the way it is a double push when it connects we hear a click sound.
5,"Make sure u insert the charger jack properly, u need to press it hard. Nak pichal pack aipoinai on kakapote."
5,"BATTERY IS A BIT LOW COMPARED TO OTHERS OF SAME PRICE BUT HDD AND SSD COMBO MAKES UP FOR THE LOSS, THERMALS ARE AWESOME.SERIOUSLY GO FOR IT IF YOU WANT BEST RTX 3050 LAPTOP, EVEN THOUGH THE TGP OF THE GPU IS A BIT LOWER THAN THE ROG STRIX G15, THE PERFORMANCE IS TOO BIG. HENCE GO FOR IT."
5,"Worth the money, if anybodys laptop is unable to charge up, remember to push the pin inside the charger port all the way in."
5,Super for gaming and editing
5,Good for gaming and editing.I love it.

5,Display quality compromise but company fix that but there is no firmware update through company
4,After replacement I got the Best Product..Worth For The Money..Fast Replacement...1st Photo where keypad lights are not working..2nd one which I got after replacement..

5,Love the Laptop. If you're looking for an excellent gaming laptop under 70k this is the best choice.
4,"Go for it, it's a nice pick."
4,"Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).Clarifications/issue points:1. It‚Äôs a plastic body and not aluminium.2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.4. There‚Äôs no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it‚Äôs body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.Pros:1. Configuration is best at this price level.2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.4. It‚Äôs light weight as it‚Äôs a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.6. Display is average and gets the job done.7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it‚Äôs expandable upto 1 TB.9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it‚Äôs a really well thought product by HP.I‚Äôll update this review after one month of usage."
1,"Different charger was sent in the box by Amazon and they were not ready to provide a replacement as I had open the laptop box.Later after several calls and struggle I was able to get the replacement and now, camera is not working for the laptop.Laptop's over-all performance is nice. Buy it from a HP showroom directly instead buying it from Amazon."
5,"Amazing laptop.. I ordered this laptop on its released date i.e. 24th feb seeing it's wonderful configuration.. I must say the decision was right..Thank u HP for this superfast laptop. And after so much of research, I think in HP this is the only laptop with high configuration (11th gen, 16gb ram, 512 SSD, 14 inch screen, light weight, finger sensor & Alexa inbuilt) under this budget."
4,"As soon as I found 11gen Gen i5 at ~62K I got stuck at it & after reading some initial reviews placed an order. Got it at promised time. Here's my review after 3 days.Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance. 1.4 Kg is not too light & noticeable. People complaining about placement of Power Key button beside delete button but believe me it'll hardly ever come your way. The plastic feels like metal. The screen doesn't lift keyboard. Typing is a pleasure.Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Finger print unlock is superfast. Apps opens in no time. Gestures works perfectly. All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram & 512 NvMe SSD.Features: Comes with ""Office Home & Student 2019"" (didn't checked is it lifelong). Dropbox 25GB for 1 year also available. Comes with some HP apps & Express VPN as well. HP quick drop helps you transfer files from your phone easily. It has Type C charging point but not sure if it is delivery charging or receiving charging point. Keyboard is backlit with two setting (full & med bright).Display: Didn't checked in daylight but at home it is very bright. Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure.Camera is 720p Camera is OK. Pictures & Videos are grainy. I won't be using it much so I'm fine with that.Speakers is unbelievably very loud & clear. At 67 its was reaching all across my apartment. Speakers are on the two sides below keyboard.Only drawback I noticed was charging pin is too tight to push & pull out.I will be posting more updates on performance, battery etc & also my overall experience as I keep using more & more.Update after 2 weeks:After lot of research & by doing practical I found that this Laptop can be charged by a Type-C charger. Believe me this is an exclusive piece of information, not many people knows this. HP call center didn't knew this, HP Showroom people don't know this, even when I asked question here someone provided wrong answer. This is an important information they should have mentioned in product detail that this Laptop supports Type C charging. I'm using HP original 65 W Type C power adapter to charge it. Attaching a photo. I did some research myself & found its USB Type C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. After reading this I ordered the Type C power adapter & it worked."
2,"If you are a College student or a professional who depends heavily on laptop for pretty much everyday then  this laptop is not for you. It hangs more often than it runs. Cannot install essential computer science software such as Eclipse or android studio because then this laptop just dies.I took this laptop thinking that it will have good performance based on its configuration.But if you are someone who wants to attend online classes or just browse, then you may go for this laptop."
5,"Very Thin, light weight, fast boot, fast shut down. Longer battery life. You will love watching full HD or 4K videos on this display.As I used for 2 days, so yet to validate battery strength on regular basis. I will share battery review after 1 week.16GB Ram, L3 8MB, 6 core Ryzen 5, NVME, good finger print lock.Delivered next day by Amazon.Keyboard gives initial impact that keys letters/numbers could be bolder. But with continued use you may find it comfortable. I think silver background and light black text may gives illusion of thin text on keys. It might be due to my use of complete black body laptop with white text keys earlier. But not big deal.Software is Win Home provided. Anti virus provided is McAfee which is one month free version. It could have been 1 year. Dropbox 12 month provided free, it could have been 1 month instead of McAfee. MS Office provided is desktop version. Office 365 is not included.I will recommend better you order laptop cushion cover and keyboard cover with this. This generation laptops are very delicate not sterdy as like before"
1,"The battery is gone in a month's time it was delivered on 5-Apr-201, hardware diagnosis says battery needs to be replaced. Have already faced issues where the keys just froze and had to contact support team."
5,11 Gen Laptop with 16GB RAM is a dream combination as of now. Good deal
4,HP Pavilion laptop is slim & look premium. It's design as similar to Apple Macbook Air. I had a another HP Pavilion laptop but it had a complaint that if you open the lap the keyboard cover will slightly bend. This HP Pavilion laptop solve it's problem.Advantage1. Light Weight2. Slim Body3. Great Display & Camera4. Enriched Bang & Olufsen sound5. Output heat is place between screenDisadvantage1. To make laptop slim they had to remove Lan/Ethernet2. The Key are white. Some time we have to turn off to see the letter of the key3. Need to buy Adapter for Lan/Ethernet supply4. There are 2 USB  & One Type C USB. If u need to connect more device buy a5. Some time it is hard to physical connect to USB AConclusion: Since it has some drawback. I did buy the product for it's price & it's Brand Also. I loved it
4,"I just see one month trial version of microsoft 365, it doesn't show me option to setup ms office. can some one help me on this?"
5,"Awesome features in this laptopScreen is delight, back lit keyboard is awesome, finger print recognition is really good. I cannot imagine I could get all these features at this price. Super fast drive, free office what else you need.... 16 gb ramBeen using this for more than 2 weeks.. I am really really happy. On top of it awesome customer care service on what's app"
5,"Did a lot of research and landed on this laptop. I am not a gamer and didn't want a gaming laptop or a laptop with a dedicated graphics card. If that's your thing, then probably look elsewhere. Was not able to find this configuration anywhere for this price - 512gb SSD, 16gb RAM with i5 processor. It's an absolute beast. Everything flies and windows is looking so much better now (I was coming from a macbook pro). I was taken a back at how good this thing is. Does all the daily tasks without a sweat. The audio output is also decent (not great). Has a USB C port which can be used for charging (haven't tried this, but someone else had put a detailed review with this feature - check it out).One con: If you close the lid and connect it to an external monitor, the wifi speed drops, if you're a bit far from your router. Let me explain: my office room is a bit far away from the router (don't ask me why I set it up like this). I took the laptop there and connected it to my monitor and closed the lid and kept it on a stand. The wifi became very slow. I disconnected the monitor and opened the lid and checked to see that the wifi speed was triple now. Googled and saw that the wifi antennas are below the trackpad - so someone suggested to keep the trackpad part of the laptop on top while placing it on the stand. This helped a bit; in the end, I kept the lid a wee bit open on the stand, and this solved the issue."

5,"This is an excellent product. Appearance looks great. Start and shutdown in a blink due to NVMe SSD. All the configurations including RAM, processor, ports are well tested and optimized. Very light waight and portable for frequent travellers."
1,"Good laptop with a decent hardware spec, was able try out some heavy graphics games and sever configuration. The disappointment was the promised MS word processing software with life long validity. Where the seller did not share the product key. This is a common scenario as many other buyers are also complaining. License software subscription is around INR 1200 per year, so please factor in that also in ur owner ship cost.Again this kind of behaviour from one of the reputed sellers on the platform is disappointing."
4,"Bought this laptop DV0543TU during GreatIndianSale-2021 at 54k(including bank offers). Apart from bank offer, I also got free PRIME membership for 1 yr and Audible membership for 6 months bundled with this laptopü§©. Used this laptop for 1 week and below is detailed review üë®‚ÄçüíªPROS üëç- Expandable option available for SSD and RAM. 476 GB of available SSD memory.- Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance- Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Applications starts/loads fast- Applications like Python, PyCharm,Photoshop etc loads quickly and runs efficiently without any hiccups- Speakers are also loud, although bottom firing- Microsoft integration is seamless, hence setup is quick.- USB Type-C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. You can also charge from Type-C port.- Battery last average around 5-6 hours (however depends upon usage patterns)CONS üëé- Charging pin, USB slots is too tight to push & pull out- Does not have SD card slot or fingerprint reader, images shown in AMAZON doesn't have correct images.- No camera shutter/privacy button- If HP doesn't bundle bag, they should atleast provide a carry case or sleeveüö© Keeping aside the cons, the HP Pavilion DV0543TU with (8GB/512GB/i5-11) can be ideal machine for buyers looking for a portable yet powerful machine without a hefty price. It's like using a trimmed down version of HP ENVY premium laptop without compromising on processing power üíª !!!"
2,"Update after one month usage - MS Office 2019 preinstalled edition became unlicensed version within 30 days and refused to activate. HP support shared their product sheet that stated that this laptop came only with a trial version of MS Office 2019. Now I am chasing seller Appario Retail to honour the commitment.Bad experience after paying high price (around ‚Çπ67,000) for preinstalled genuine software.Other wise product has sleek looks, superfast fingerprint scanner, very good display, very responsive touchpad, decent (but tinny) speakers, USB C and barrel plug charging options and under 10 second boot up (SSD drive). Preloaded with Win10 Home and MS Office (not sure whether trial or full version). Drawbacks - weighs 1.42 kg, base gets warm rather quickly and so does the power adapter. Decent for a college student."
1,"Worst Amazon experience ever. This laptop arrived with a defective battery and even after 3 hours of charging, the battery level remained at 65% when the power cord was removed from supply. Immediately on removing the power cord the laptop shuts down. There is no matter any charge left on the laptop battery which seems to be defective. Never expected such a faulty product from HP. Very pathetic and really disappointed. Could not return it or replace it without booking an inspection appointment. Waiting for them to arrive and inspect it. Never buy HP products as they dont appear to be QC ed properly. Could not give a negative rating so selecting 1 star.Edited - The inspection happened 2 days after requesting for replacement. The replacement laptop was approved and ordered. It took another 2 days for Amazon to ship and deliver. However, the delivery person refused to hand over the replacement and accept the defective laptop as he could not power it on!!The actual defect was the battery and there was no way he could start it or power on without using the external power cord.The delivery person left without accepting the inspected and marked defective laptop. I‚Äôm still waiting for confirmation that the laptop will be replaced. Pathetic experience from both Amazon and HP. Would have given negative 10 stars for Earth‚Äôs customer centric company if possible."
4,"Cons:This laptop has rectangular display and if you were using MacBook 13, you might get surprised to see this screen feels smaller than that. So I suggest checking this out in physical store before buying.I did not like the mouse trackpad as it‚Äôs not very responsive and sometimes gives wrong feedback.Battery is decent, If not the best.Pros:Thin, sleek, lightweight and handy.Windows package is good with free office.Laptop in general is quite fast"
5,"Writing this review after 15 days of usage. The box contains the laptop and the charging cable. The laptop weighs  exactly 1.4 KG, and it's quite nice. It has all the specifications as advertised, i.e. 16 GB ram, and 500 GB NVME SSD. It does not have IR camera so no face unlocking will support. The finger print sensor is fast. Office 2019 is pre-installed and needs only to be activated, so while booting up for the first time it's best to have a mail id ready. the USB type C port is good and I have tested with data transfer only, not display and power output, although according to blogs and forums it will support both. Battery life is not completely tested but it's fairly ok, as of now I have got backup worth of definitely 6 hrs."
1,"HP would not consider dead pixel in warranty as they need 2 dead pixels. Above that if in case there is a dead pixel, then they will try their best to put up many reasons to not entertain it in warranty, calling it customer induced damage.. LOL..Buy this at your own risk from Amazon. Who knows what i faced was because of Amazon induced damage during delivery...Someone tell HP that most common reason for a dead pixel is a MANUFACTURING DEFECT.."
1,"A bad choice purchase from amazon. After a week of use, the laptop screen display goes off every 5 to 10 minutes. When it goes off, I need to switch the laptop on, the display comes back and after 5 minutes again goes off, again switch it on.  Tired of it. Frustrated. Don't buy electronics from Amazon."
2,It‚Äôs look like renewed laptop because laptop charging jack is loose and left side speaker sounds like it‚Äôs tear. Bad sound quality  and finger sensor quality look like 2011 touch phone of wing and any Chinese phone touch. Waste of money and one more thing day by day Amazon product quality getting poor
4,"Product design looks good, good display, tacky keyboard and good battery.The price could have been better.And missing on finger scanner!! This was missing information from the Q&AAlso office 2019 is just installed, but not activated. Microsoft account is required to activate. And If you are using a license elsewhere against the Microsoft account, then you will have trouble activating.. Factor this please"
5,"Like:Booting time is very less.Light weightSuper fastFinger touch unlock is super fastDislike:180 hinges are missingOpening lid is not designed properly, bit difficult to open the lid"
1,THE PROCESSOR MENTIONED ON WEBSITE IS OF 4.2GHZ BUT WHAT I RECIEVED IS OF 2.4GHZ
1,Had an issue with the product and the HP service support is horrible.I have called their support number about 10 times and written multiple emails. It‚Äôs been more than 10 days and nothing much has happened.Now the laptop is jst a piece of waste affecting my kids online school.
5,"This is a clean and elegant device. The keyboard strokes are so smooth and makes you to type more. Weighing at 1.75KG it handles with ease. The FHD display with thin bezels gives you an immersive viewing experience. 16GB of RAM, SSD and Ryzen 5 gives you instant responses. It also upgraded itself to Windows 11. One issue was with '@' and '#' as they couldn't be typed. HP Support asked to uninstall and reinstall keyboard driver to solve the issue. However the laptop seems to work fine now even without doing it. Fingerprint reader is fast. The aesthetics is great minus the stickers. Overall a worthy purchase. If you are eligible for exchange please use that option and use credit card for getting a better deal."
5,Amazing performance . Best laptop of my life . Maxed Gpu helped to run every tasks. Perfect price range .
5,"Perfect for everyday tasks ( considering the price point)Display 10/10Processing 8/10Keyboard 9/10Wireless connectivity 10/10Multitasking 7/10Webcam 7/10Boot 8/10Speaker 8/10Warranty 10/10But I have received this product today , This is my first impression.I can say that it is an upgraded version of Avita essential.( Processor, Bluetooth, Operating system)"
5,"Every thing looks good like fast, clarity and brightness . power back up. Only one problem is camera is in  bottom and small kids  like below 7th if they are using for online class they have to sit very near to laptop ... Or their face video will not visible."
1,Third class... Trackpad doesn't work
1,Agar aap ye laptop lene ka soch rahe hai to bhai bilkul mat lena. Jitna ghatiya ye product hai usase se jyada ghatiya inki service hai. 23 July ko Maine purchase kiya tha. Aur 1 week me hi laptop dead ho gaya.  Customer care no. Par 30 minutes tak waiting. Todays date 1 September replacement Milne ka bole hai but abhi tak nahi mila hai.  E mail I'd par bhi complaint kiya but koi reply mujhe aaj tak nahi mila...so please dusra koi bhi le lo. But isko mat lena....Bhai ye bhaut hi ghatiya brand hai. Please don't purchase maine jo galti ki ye purchase karke please aap mat karna. 1 month se jyada time ho gaya hai aaj tak mujhe mera replacement wala laptop nahi mila hai.
1,"screen is good everything else is average connectivity is even below average as it has only 2 usb ports nun of them is 3.0 and it does not have any lan port either, its only a wifi laptop.. all ports even 3.5mm earphone jack and charging all are placed on back with usb ports so it makes a bit difficult to access them while working.. and the webcam is also places above the keyboard so can not adjust it by tilting screen have to move the whole laptop.. ram and rom both are not expendable which seems idiotic.. don't know why the company did all these stupid things and made a good product below average they could have positioned the camera and ports on right places where they normally are and could have given option to increase ram and rom and this could have been the best product in range."
3,"The camera position is  not on the screen and on the bottom panel makes it difficult to position during many scenarios.  No ethernet port, All the ports are at the back and makes it hard to reach.Positive side is the price, the only available below 20 K for students to take online classes."
5,"Cute, affordable, totally worth at this price, full hd display just awsome... Best at this price range.."
4,"Talking about the Laptop , I have been using it for the past 12 days , Battery backup is good, talking about the camera it is at the base of the laptop it makes a bit difficult to do any video call, Rest is good so far no cons observed, if we consider any laptop under this price range."
4,Value for money.Good for online classes. Webcam is not above.So it will be difficult for small children to attend. Otherwise ok.
4,Everything working fine. Only one problem is camera is in bottom. Laptop is worth for this price.MS office is only one trail.
1,After using it for just 3 days the laptop is not turning on.just the led light remains on
1,Keyboard is not working. Typing keys have problem. If we write A it Q written
1,"Looks of laptop Is very good and light weight also but performance is very poor. Laptop heats up very much, poor battery backup and 3rd grade toll free number and service..."
5,Best for students.
1,Study but laptop battery is bad now laptop is not working because if you plug it instead of charging it will draining and it will off while still pluged
5,This is my first product of Avita. First impression was great. Worth for this money. Display is super.. I will update the review as required..
1,"After 1 month Battery down. Laptop even shutdown after plug in.No reply from customer support,after contacting them"
1,Battery gets low very fast while using zoom app and sound is low in performance . I'm not satisfied with my laptop.
4,good product.value for money need to change in camera
4,BEST LAPTOP FOR STUDENTS.
5,Like
5,Superb laptop
4,"Storage is Low, but everything is on cloud ."
4,Nice product best performance
5,This laptop is very nice and useful .value for the money
5,Value for money.
3,Better features at this price range. I am happy.
1,I like features but the built quality is bad
5,"Full installation process shared in this channel.This is a great buy at this price. For those who think SSD is missing, you need to enable it in BIOS. Press F2 to load BIOS.Do not initiate a replacement just because you don't know how to install OS or find SSD. You will never get this again for 37k."
4,"Good fast laptop for moderate use, suitable for most people who don't need to play high end games. I have a similar laptop from lenovo 2 years old, the keyboard got faulty, and now it is faulty again, so have costed me to replace keyboards twice. Otherwise its good laptop, SSD is fast. Screen is good. You will need external mouse to install fresh operating system. Disable VHD controller in Bios before you install OS. Wifi Drivers will need to be downloaded beforehand on a USB from lenovo website otherwise you will not connect to wifi. Do updates of Win 10 to 20H2 version, and install chipset and other drivers from Lenovo site manually. You can use Lenovo bridge to autodetect the laptop version. I hope this laptop doesn't give keyboard issue. The screen is a bit thin, so avoid grabbing laptop from screen. For dual monitors, it was giving lot of flickering and a headache, then a solution on lenovo website about disabling error reporting service, and one other,  in safe mode has maybe solved it."
5,Press f2 and open bios.Now find vmd controller in bios and disable it.Now You will be able to see ssd while installing windows.
5,"Received the product in time. I am writing this review after 4 days of use. Till today performance is excellent. If you go for installed windows product , it will cost 4-5 K more.Some people complained about no disk found while installing the windows.I also faced same issue. Then i visited to local computer repair shop & they did it.Few videos are also available on YouTube, you have to select the right one.Thanks"
4,I like battery performance display brightness is little less but no issuesVery good laptop in one word. for SSD issue go to bios by F2 key then select intel vdm controller to disabled and save restart it then make bootable windows pendrive with Rufus software and select option uefi and partition got in the  software while creating bootable pendrive . Then u will see windows install and SSD drive in instaltion . Very easy step if any doubt follow me on insta ER. anjul
5,Really handy and good looking laptop. Loaded with best configuration at this price...one might face some problems while installing os...but once you manage to do that...you'll have a nice experience.
5,Installed Kubuntu/Ubuntu. No lags. Kubuntu boots super fast. Nice display. Overall very good laptop. Sturdy design and light weight.
1,Purchased it by mistake as the image saying that it is a DOS laptop was not present at the time of buying. Took to local shop for installing windows.  They said SDD not detected while installing windows. Had to return it. Thanks to Amazon as they agreed for returning the laptop as I need a windows one.
5,"I got this for around 32k and I can‚Äôt ask for more. i3 11th generation with 8GB RAM and 256GB samsung SSD inside is exactly what I was looking for, nd DOS saved some extra money.I tried playing GTA V on it and guess what, it was running very smoothly with some changes in game settings. Remember, it‚Äôs not a gaming PC but still I can play some good graphics games on this."
3,Keyboard quality is not good . Screen is visible only when you are sitting straight to the laptop screen.
5,it is. very good laptop..ms office installation just disable secure boot up option in bios along with disabling intel  vmd option and i can install easily
4,"This is the review of the 16-e0162AX model [ AMD Ryzen 5 with Radeon RX5500M GPU ]The system is exactly the same as the GTX 1650 variant except for the GPU.  In papers Radeon RX5500M is better than GTX 1650.For the first impression, I like the overall design of the laptop.The screen looks fantastic.  One of the major issue highlighted is the refresh rate but I do play games with PS4 connected to my TV / Projector and they are all 60 Hz only and I don't find it really botheringKeyboard is fun to type.  Its backlit but only single color and brightness.  The power button is part of the keyboard layout which requires us to be careful not to press it while trying to use the function keysThe trackpad is one of the best I would say.  While typing this comment, multiple times my palm have pressed the trackpad but it didn't interfered [Awesome].  The tracking was smooth.  When it comes to games, a wired mouse is a must thoughIt right away allowed me to upgrade to Windows 11.  With a few documented changes, it does looks pretty familiar with Windows 10.  I don't see any performance degradation with the upgrade as of now.  Time will tellThe best part is inclusion of Microsoft office 2019 version which is a fully licensed version.  Not many gaming laptop have this and is very usefulThe integrated GPU have 512 MB DDR4 dedicated memory and the dedicated graphics card have 4GB GDDR6 RAM which should be able to handle most of the AAA games.  Will try out few titles and update my review from Gaming perspectiveNow to the not so fun part.As many have pointed out in the review of the GTX 1650, the wobbling of the screen is noticeable but haven't interfered with my usage.  May affect gaming, time will tellThe included 8 GB RAM may not be enough as with nothing additional installed in the machine, currently the memory usage is at 65%.  Good thing is the entire 8 GB is in single slot allowing you to add additional 16 GB RAM in the empty slotThe unknown factsHave read reviews in the GTX 1650 model that the dedicated graphics is used all the time and there's not setting to disable and use the integrated GPU [to save battery while not gaming].  But with this laptop, I am facing the reverse.  My usage of the last 8 hours, only my integrated graphics was used and the dedicated graphics is idle.  I am not sure if it will only be activated while gaming.  Have to check it outThe reduction in 1 star is only related to this GPU issue.  I might update my rating after getting some answersOverall, it's worth the money.  If you want a performance laptop without burning through your savings, you can buy this without a second thought.  If you are a pro gamer, better to go with other brands with RTX 3xxx and above GPU with 144 Hz and above screen refresh rate"
5,"I bought it for 59kfirst I clear doubts about specifications of laptop1.screen is 60hz and 63-68 % srgbit is good display for normal gaming.2.adafter provided is 150 w (200w is for higher variants)3.keboard light brightness is not adjustable. Either on or off.4.there is no mux switch to switch between dedicated and integrated GPu. Until u apply load graphic card don't start working.5.ram expandable up-to 32gb and storage up-to 1tb m.2ssd (not 4tb ,4tb is for higher varient.)not hdd slot.6.u only adjust fan speed to maximum or Auto.7.given free windows 11 upgrade.8.anti virus is trail version only (in question section manufacturer said full version. )9.it is made of  plastic body.10.cpu tgp 45w gpu 85w.As from utube sources and benchmarks r5 5600h is approximately equal to i7 10 th gen. And gpu rx5500m lies between 1660 and 1660 ti.for normal usage temperature is below  55(for coading, browsing, multitasking) but it again depends on surrounding temperature .keyboard and track pad is good.As  utube reviewers said there in no much screen wobble it is fine(until unless u disturb it, it won't wobble. It tried using it under ceiling  fan and it also not wobble even the cpu and gpu fans speed are set to  maximum ,it won't wobble much.). battery backup is not  that much good as  it has 70 whr battery maybe because of large screen.Brightness also fine. Laptop is little bulky.But one thing, I installed nzxt Cam, I don't know why but the curser stopped workingAfter  I opened nzxt Cam .so I uninstalled it, after that I never found that curser issue. (it maybe because of software compatability problem of that software) .Overall performance is good. Good laptop at this price."
5,"I purchased it for Coding, Video & Photo Editing and also a bit of gaming. Mostly i multitask a lot using different desktop for all sorts of work and i goes through it smoothly.Display : It is sharp and nice and the viewing angle are also quite good. Brightness level is optimum for indoor use and just fine for outside use. 144hz is missing and can bother few hardcore gamers but i don't mind it being not there.Upgradibility : It has two slots for storage and ram. One slot of each is equipped with 512 samsung nvme ssd and 8gb ram.Storage can be expanded upto 4 tb and ram upto 32 gb ram using both slots.Performance : This laptop is equipped with Ryzen 5 5600h + RX 5500M and performs like a beast so no issue regarding performance. You can throw any game at it and it will do fine.Battery : It works upto 3 hrs on performance mode and upto 6-7 hours on quite mode. I would advice to switch to quite mode if you're performing normal task like typing or web browsing.Build : It is premium plastic and feels great and the finish is also top notch. The screen wobbles but hasn't been an issue to me. It has been just overhyped a bit.Final Conclusion : I bought is for 58k aftee using debit card and it was a great deal for me. It is an all rounder covering everything you expect in a laptop. That's my review as of now. Also it got updated to Windows 11 and works smoothly.Will update if any issue in few weeks or a month."
5,"Ordered this laptop on 2nd oct for 58999rs and it was delivered to me on 10th oct.I mainly purchased this laptop for graphic designing work like sketchup, enscape, autocad and 3ds max. It works like a charm and doesn't take too much time to render.I would suggest to go for rx5500m instead of gtx1650 because amd one has more processing sheders(1408) and based on 7nm architecture.Battery consumption is slightly higher than the one which comes with gtx1650.The output of the charger provided with laptop is 150w and the charging speed is pretty fast.U can update the latest drivers from windows updater or hp assistant.The graphic drivers can be update from amd website using radeon pro software.I didn't play any games on this laptop but am pretty sure that it would perform well and will provide u descent fps in most aaa titles.Additional ram and ssd slot is given in this laptop so u can upgrade them in future.Speakers are not loud but the voice is clear. Webcam is average.Overall it's a good laptop under 60k do consider buying it if you are looking for a good laptop with good after sales support and assistance from hp."
3,"The trackpad in the victus makes a clicking sound when tapped anywhere around the trackpad. It is held loose , i can literally feel the trackpad hitting the bottom pannel. Im thinking of getting a replacement and also i dont know if thats a issue with my model. Seriously disappointed..."
5,In 55k got best of all things you want in a laptop.
4,Everything is fine except a small backlight problem in one corner of displayAnd Good performance but fps is decreases while playing game for about 5 minutes .. To fix this it needs a sleep on and off then good stable fps..
5,"Its good for its price range....wobbling was not that much of an issue...it's a 4 way air flow unlike told on the product features when we are scrolling....dedicted graphics card won't run untill we give some load,thinking about it it's better..overall good"
4,Ryzen 5 5600H is best under 60k but don't update into windows 11 now
1,"Don't invest your money in HP victus series. Google it. Or read reviews on Amazon. HP has manufacturing defect in victus. Motherboard goes down in just 2-3 months of usage, AND HP has no parts for replacements. You'd find many like me struggling with HP for this. Some 3-4 months older cases, still not attended to. Beware. Buy something else."
5,"First of all thanks to HP for launching victus here.. the laptop looks stunning, have the perfect configuration for budget gamers.. this gpu and 3050, 3050Ti, must come between 70k-80k..the laptop is awesome .. probably run as cool as omen.. .. hope this will be available soon under great price üëç and please HP don't use 60hz display in this .. otherwise it will be discarded by us üôè"
5,Simply Superb Victus with Radeon Graphics... super cool combo at 60000 price. Go for this laptop.... Good performance with Victus.
3,Amazing performance good GPU and CPU but not a value of money it has good performance but not as good as 74000. Feeling cheated. Price dropped  Rs 4000 within 25 days of purchase.
5,Everything about this product is similar to a costlier laptopGraphics cardRefresh rateRamCpu
4,Pros:-Graphics: Damn good-Performance: Awesome-Processor: Quiet as if like fan less laptop-Speed: Too Damn good-Boot speed: less than 3 seconds-Works like office work station-Worth buyCons:-Battery lasts upto 4.5hrs with full fledge office work-bulky.. cannot hold laptop with one hand
5,Good
3,"Pros:The build quality is good.Graphics are great.Highly recommended for hardcore gamers who plays by keeping their device in charge.Cons:Tha battery life is too poor, its lasts for about 2 hours only that too while using low graphic applications.The screen is too worse. My screen was damaged twice, but thanks to HP they offered me 3rd new laptop in the same week one after the other."
4,Pros:-Graphics: Good-Performance: Best-Processor: Silent Fan-Speed: BestCons:-Battery lasts less than 4 hours with full fledged work.
5,Literally every review for this laptop on Amazon is for the wrong product but I still got recommended about this and it met my expectations. Would appreciate if u look after the reviews AMAZON....
1,Sd card slot missing in laptop.
3,"intel i10 made it overvalued as 1650 cant do much job, if u looking for processor go for i11 in same range, if u looking for gaming then go for at least 1660ti"
5,It is best for gaming and regular student task. My works are done by using this dell laptop. Only issue is battery life is not good.
4,"First of all, I don't understand people reviewing this laptop saying it doesn't come with Windows. It's clearly written DOS!!! Do some reality check before you purchase something.This laptop is a good budget option, and it becomes better with upgrades.IMPORTANT: The laptop only accepts M.2 NVME, not a regular M.2 which is not mentioned anywhere. Almost returned the laptop because I thought it was faulty. The mouse track pad has some issues and multi touch gestures were non existent but updates fixed it. And also, had to update the driver for RAM because it wasn't accepting a new external stick. Without the upgrades, the laptop will be sluggish, but now with the upgrades, which cost less than buying a laptop with all those extras, is running great. Laptop is not meant for gaming or editing, just keep this in mind."
2,"Thought will upgrade it to NVME SSD and RAM to 12GB by own. If your thinking about the same then please don't. Yes, you can upgrade it to SSD, my suggestion is to go with Kingston A2000 that offers best price to performance ratio. Also get a DDR4 stick of 8GB maximum. There is onboard DDR4 4GB 2400mhz CL17 RAM by Micron, hence getting a Crucial memory is recommended. As 2400mhz ram isn't available you can put a 2666 or 3200 with no issue, it will downclock and work absolutely fine.But unfortunately few things that you can't upgrade and is a serious deal breaker is:1. Screen: It's a TN panel of 1366x768 resolution. Not only the resolution is poor the picture quality is worst I've ever seen. Black levels are very poor, everything looks gray, white looks yellowish. There is no ica profile provided by Lenovo. The only get around is to customize it from AMD Adrenalin, still you'll not get much improvement. Strictly no if you're gonna do some photo or video editing.2. Speakers: It's better to have no speakers than having such speaker. Very low volume, no bas, no travel. It feels tiny, can't even hear to video calls.3. Webcam: Now thanks to covid, people are lying on video calls and this camera is absolutely not a fit. Video quality is very very poor. Makes no sense of putting such 19s phone camera.4. Touchpad: Elan touchpad isn't good enough for multi touch experience.5. No fingerprint: While Asus Vivobook of same price offers fingerprint reader.6. No NVME screw: No NVME screw is present, arrange your own while putting a ssd.7. Battery life: On power saver mode you can hardly work for 4 hours on a full charge otherwise 2-3 hours. Now battery life on most of the laptops in these price range is poor but here the main problem is it takes 2.5-3 hrs for full charge and then only 2.5-3 hours of use. Makes no sense.8. USB ports: All the usb ports are on the left side.Now few good things:1. Warranty: While most of the laptops at this price range comes with 1 year warranty this offers 3 years, and if you pay Rs.3100 more you can extend it to 4 years. This is certainly needed if you're aware that Keyboard being faulty is one of the very common issues in any laptop now a days, and in this model the keyboard comes with the top cover.2. Build quality: Doesn't feels flimsy and plasticky like HP laptops.3. Keyboard: Keyboard feels good to type and feedback is good.4. Stays cool: Ryzen 3 stars to bottleneck just after 2 minutes of stresstest, but it manages to stay cool.5. Cheaper: As it doesn't come with pre installed ssd and ram from the brand, it is significantly cheaper. Lenovo charges several thousand of rupees for putting some low quality ssd.6. Style: This one looks very classy and professional. Best suitable for office use, not very glossy and fancy.Conclusion: This laptop is for poor people, if you can't afford higher end system and can manage with the cons then only get it and upgrade it urself."
5,"The best part of this laptop is balanced configuration in this price segment of 27k and Lenovo and amd reliable relationship.Moreover ryzen 3 is good compared to i3 and good boot speed.You need to install the windows yourself and better if vendor provide it but nevertheless the latest technical sounds feature will excites you.Lastly, sound is average which is one lag"
4,"I bought this laptop in August 2021 and writing this review after using it for 40 days. This laptop is a good buy for me with some exceptions. I had to do some modifications to make it work for me. Now, no issues as such after I upgraded my laptop to 8 GB RAM and installed SSD drive with Windows 10 operating system.Some cons -1. After installing additional RAM only 5.5 GB RAM is user available - rest is utilized by integrated graphics.2. Webcam is a disappointment. Just 0.31 Megapixels - poor resolution. It could have been better.3. Touchpad and keyboard on a laptop seem vulnerable. Refrain from using it. Use an external keyboard and mouse if you would like to increase its life.I took help from LaptoBoost to upgrade my laptop."
1,Just so you know id doesn't have windows pre installed so you need to do it yourself . Im having that issues since i didn't see it in the discriptions
4,Ok with this price range...  Slightly slow. Design is good and very light weight.
5,The laptop is a good one but the hard drive  makes the laptop SLOW AF. I'd advise to immediately upgrade to an SSD
1,Definitely of worst product to purchase in Amazon portal. But I must say I have received great response from customer service Ms. Nidhi but the person who has come from courier is is very rude. Overall experience is miserable. If I am given an option to upload his response over phone I can show.
5,"I brought this laptop and an ssd drive.After receiving, I swapped the ssd and this laptop is now faster."
1,Not working
1,Very poor items. It doesn't include any windows in home addition. Return policy is not available.
1,Damages product
3,"Did not meet expectations:Takes significant time to start since it first display logo of fijustu.The material around touch pad feels weak. This is where you would hold the device in your hands. Feels like it can break easily.Camera quality is poor. Also the physical camera shutter is very difficult to use and feels cheap.There are no support assistantance application available.You need to register for warrenty. Website is very confusing. You won't find your device easily.Faced a glitch while using MS office 19 later it go resolved.If it is placed on mattress and put on charging, fan would make a lot of noise and laptop would shutdown abruptly. It think there is problem with ventilation.Just by opening single chrome window, 4 GB of ram is utilised and cooling fan starts working heavily.The sound quality is poor.Best thing is it very light.I regret not going for LG Gram.Also, I have no idea where are their service centres. When I registered for warranty I got successful confirmation message from Lenovo."
5,First day of using this laptopIt‚Äôs damn fast and the keypad is smooth to operate.Great display of craftsmanship.Bravo Japanese. Really it‚Äôs cut above all other manufacturers
1,"This laptop is great in terms of how light weight it is but I do not think this is a good laptop for business use. I have tried this for zoom calls but the speaker is pathetic and camera is even worse.. Very flimsy and has lot of flex. Keypad is not as good as you find on lenovo or hp. Tried my best to adjust but ultimately has to return it. The battery life is not that good. Just 4-5 hrs at the max.  Not sure what Japanese tech went into this laptop, this feels like any other cheap Chinese laptop."
5,Lighter than a tab with a solid build quality.
3,"The speakers and sound quality are pathetic and poor. The speed is highlighted, and the visuals are perfect. Just the speakers to avoid!"
4,wonderful product. feather lite. awesome.
2,"Overpriced for this mediocre product with no brand value, better to check out other products in reputed brands like dell, Hp, Asus"
5,An excellent machine for the price for business usecases like MS Office and web browsing. Intel CPU does work well and at cooler temperatures than the Ryzen 3 processors that come at a similar price. Go for it if you're not looking for very CPU and GPU intensive workflows like hardcore gaming and video editing as it has only integrated GPU. The system is extremely lightweight and blazing fast due to the ample 8gb RAM and 512 gb SSD. This is a 1 week usage review. Will post updates if I notice anything else.
5,"Light weight and slim with rich look,Fast boot,Long battery life,Overall good performancePerfect laptop for personal office use..I am giving this feedback with 3 weeks of usage."
4,"Received my laptop along with adaptor today in very good condition, it is a 1 day delivery.It is a brand new laptop, nice color (grey), light weight and slim, very good configuration too (Intel i3 3Ghz processor, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 512 GB SSD Hard Disk) and i setup my windows and MS Office it was very quick and easy, after installing i reboot windows and it is just took 10-15 seconds which is quick, it has finger print sensor to unlock or to login.i felt that Speaker volume was a little less than expected and web cam quality was not very good, but still it is good enough for attending online meeting and classes (maybe we are used to high quality camera mobiles and taking pictures in it), so we can't expect the same in this camera.Unable to check the battery as of now, since i received my laptop only today, i will updated my reviews again after using my laptop for 1-2 months.Very Happy with my New Laptop !!!"
5,Definitely worth the money... Sleek and compact.Pros:Backlit keyboardFingerprintScreen is brilliantSound is okDual channel 3200mhz ram (8gb)ConsDefinitely Not lightweightGets warm at base.. you can feel it if kept on lap. it can be a good thing as heat dissipation works.Charger port is not USB cBattery life is 4-5 hrs of watching movie or binging. But quick charge covers this drawback. 0-60% in an hr.Overall it's excellent for the price. (44k)Please don't compromise on quality for price. This laptop has good built quality and provides 2 yr warranty.Go for it blindly.
5,"Overall a good laptop..Quickly its prons and consPros:-1.Excellent display Anti glare2.Backlit keyboard3.i3 11th gen intel processtor which is latest4.8gb(4gb+4gb) ram and 256 gb ssd so boot time is less than 5 sec and smooth5.Fingrint sensor for quick login6.Ms office lifetime free7.2 yrs warranty screenshot attached.8.Compact laptop for personal and business use .9.Usb type C port is there10.No major heating issue..smooth ...Fan is also silent...11.Lots of modes are there to select as high performance,balance,battery saver...etc in lenvo vantage appCons.1.I have bought 256gb ssd one suggesting  better to go for 512gb one...##Will not commented on battery...will update it later after using for some months..Till now doing better."
1,"I ordered Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 2021 laptop (82H700J8IN) for my kid to attend online, received laptop as per Amazon delivery in July 2021.Issues:1. The keyboard Backlit not working from the Day I received laptop.2. Mic stopped working after a week, using earphone as Mice3. Black screen after 1 month of usage, only online class without installation of any games or apps.4. Tech support called and try to fix the issue over phone, but no luck, I am waiting for technician to visit and solve the laptop issuesReally it is waste of money and I did not expect such a poor performance of a Lenovo Laptop at this price."
1,Network keep on disconnecting whereas on other device its 100% stable without any disconnections.
5,"it is very good laptop for day to day usage. Screen quality is good for this price,sound quality is very good.. overall performance is very good, feel premium in hands."
5,"Purchased this laptop for personal use. Following are activities performed.1. Browsing2. Emails in Outlook3. Office 365 accessNo video editing, no content creation. Works flawless. Good Speed and performance."
4,"Purchased laptop in Dasara sale for 42K. It is simply worth for money, performance is adequate for the money paid.Pros:1. Its good for day to day usage and online classes.2. Back light keyboard is highlight and keyboard is so soft and very good to use.3. Display is 300 nits and its very much brighter compared to other laptops.4. Battery is descent5. Very slim and elegant designCons:1. Sound through laptop speakers is low2. Design particularly upper part (outside) could be matte finish3. finger print doesn't work all the timesNote : This is my experience in my one months of usage"
5,"Writing this review nearly after 20 days of use.Overall the laptop is good.Delivery was on time.No lag while using as 8gb ram, i3 processor and 256gb ssd does it's job quite well.Mainly i use it for Documents(not to forget MS office is included) and Browsing and battery backup is around 7-8 hrs and it does charge fast. Sound quality is average and screen brightness is kind of okay so not to expect more.It would have been better if there was an ethernet port."
5,Best product in this value range. The screen size may be little small for people used to working in 15 inch laptops but over time one gets adjusted to 14 inch screen. It's super light and easy to carry around.Laptop boots up literally in seconds and the response time is superfast. A good value addition. Also was able to  update warranty start date to delivery date and get complete 24 months warranty coverage.
2,For me total Storage space showing only 475GB but in spec it is mentioned 512GB is it normal or any problem please anyone reply me
5,Enriched with all latest features.Not any single lag.One of the best laptop in the market in this price.Delighted with this computer
1,Its been only 3 days that that I have received this laptop and it started shutting down automatically. Its really heartbreaking to your hard earned money is ruined by this worthless improperly tested products. Just stay away from this laptop and save your money.
1,"Recording / micro phone issue less than a month . Contacted Amazon for replacement , but I was informed to contact Lenevo for service / warranty. Disappointed with this issues"
5,"7 hrs battery life,1.4 kg weight,with i3 intel processor 11gen MSO backlit/finger print reader 256gb SSD is okey and price reasonable. Thanks Amazon"
4,"The laptop is very good with fast processing, thanks to its SAMSUNG NVMe SSD and 8gb 3200MHz RAMTrack pad can be slightly better (not faced any major issue)Comes with genuine Windows 10 and MS officeDisplay is awesomeThe only cons of this product is it's battery. It lasts only for around 3 hr not as much it claims."
5,"Light weight and portable, the laptop is very easy to use and quite responsive. I have used it for various applications (excel, ppt, Google meet, Facebook etc) and found no issues. Haven‚Äôt tried it for performance intensive activities like gaming etc"
5,Video Player is loading.
1,Its a good one but buy it from market..never do shopping of electronic gadgets from Amazon..they gonna make u regret on your decission..
4,"Good performance, but the speakers are extremely poor. You literally need ur ears stuck to the laptop to hear anything"
4,Laptop is good in this price range. Volume level is too low and battery backup is not more than 4-5 hours in normal use.
5,"This laptop is good for personal use like emails, watching movies, browsing. Also its light and has better battery backup. It has nvme ssd which makes storing and retrieving data blazing fast"
1,I bought this laptop and it's display was defective it doesn't got on I asked Amazon to replace and they took more than 20 days to and even after 20 days they refunded me didn't given replacement. I have to call Amazon costumer care daily for more than 20 days it's very bad experience with Amazon
5,"This is one amazing product, viewers if you are planning on purchasing this one, do it and you won't regret it ‚ù§"
5,Good one with good battery life and sound quality is very good and bootup is very fast good one..
4,Screen quality is not good.
5,"This laptop is amazing. I really love it. This is the first big purchase i made from my salary savings, so i did a lot of research. After a month of using, i can say: the battery is really good. The sound system is also really good. Love the display and the design. The camera is shit and it's really pixelated but i don't mind. The big empty space at the bottom of the screen really bothered me before buying but i barely even notice it. It even gives an elevated feel to the screen and i quite like it. So yea, I'm happy with my decision to buy this."
1,"Having worked with Acer, Dell and HP, wanted to try Lenovo and was disappointed as the machine was painfully slow from bootup to shutdown.Ordered a replacement and still the same. Going back to tried and tested HP.Update : problem occurred with HP too, was told the issue was unavailability of SSD. After installing SSD, HP machine was fast, maybe that was the issue with lenovo too"
4,"decent laptop for the price.. bought for around 32k from amazon. very light weight and sturdy. battery lasts very much and charges very quickly.keyboard quality is really nice.display bezel on the 14inch panel is very big amd steals the look.diaplay as such is not 'stunning' pretty basic. speakers too not very deep and all, pretty basic stuff.comes with win10 and ofdice 2019 pre installed. office has just basic 5GB onedrive data.mcafee 1month trial.all over its a decent laptop for light home uses."
5,This is so good... Really best... Hard disk capacity is little low however u can use a external 1TB Harddrive
1,Service given for installation .. I dont even know if it's in good condition .By the time this guys fix the installation service by then my exchange date would have been missed . No point in buying like this expensive stuffToo worst service on installation andnpoor packaging . I don't know if I got a right stuff. I was waiting for the installation guy to open the box
1,Not happy with memory configuration for ~34KUseless laptop and service by amazoneOnce the goods are delivered and paid moneyCuser need to run piller to pillar to get the issue resolvedLap top has issues. I am taking this issue leagally now
1,Worst product.. they will give you a defective piece and the replacement will never happen.Its been more than 3 weeks i still have the defective piece and nothijg is happening.the agent is cancellikg the order withoit my knowledge and asking me to come at the center and verify the laptop is working or not.
5,I LIKE THIS LAPTOPTHE PROCESSOR IS ALSO FAST AND GOODBUTTHIS LAPTOP HAS ONLY ONE PROBLEM OF STARTING IT TAKES 3-4 MINS TO STARTBATTERY CAPACITY IS BETTERIT GETS DISCHARGE FAST IN DOING CLASSES OR PLAYING GAMESELSEIN DOING PERSONAL WORKS THE CAPACITY ENOUGH1 TB IS VERY GREAT IN THIS LAPTOP IN USING ALL SOFTWARE
3,About weight it's ok but not the light weight regarding battery it is not giving max 4 hours... It is draining fastly.Regarding battery there is issue
3,"As far as Laptop functionality consideration its working just fine but at the same time its accessaries also same importance , without charger/battery you can't operate  the laptop. Laptop charger stoped working and some liquid like contents from it started burning. Having no nearest service centre, It will cost me extra to buy new Charger. Company should provide well tested and good performing accessaries."
1,"Not satisfied, touch pad is vibrating and touchpad keys are worst..  performance speed is slow, built quality is very bad and the product is more than 1.7 kg, totally not satisfied,  I am looking for return and refund by Amazon.."
1,Received a defective product. Integrated camera not detected. Tech support from Lenovo wasn't helping on time. Amazon replacement policy is also painful...
4,I liked the metal body. It didnt heat up like my 8th gen laptop. Performance has been good for multitasking so far. I didnt like the webcam resolution.
5,The colour silver grey and sleek design gives premium look.And best part for me was the OS and Office was pre-installed. So I didn't had to waste my time in getting crack and basic software installation. For this price it was good package.
5,"Pros:Good bootup speedCompactLightweightSmooth functioningCons:Poor camera qualityOverall, a satisfied customer."
4,"Light weight. MS office is part of the package. However, only Word and Excel are installed. PowerPoint is missing."
1,"Laptop Stoped Working in 1 Month and ""NO"" Support"" what so ever; Amzaon sends us to Lenovo. Lenovo has worst support system; initialy we were happy but as it stoped working and, we are strugling to get support from either Amzon or Lenovo.Will ""STRONGLY"" recomend not to buy, as it may be best product but of no use if it has no proper after sales support"
1,"The screen does not turn on, a few days after purchase. Now have to run after getting it repaired. :/"
5,This laptop is the best laptop for students who play mid-range games and attending for online classesits been 1 and half month since i have bought this laptop for my son so far have not caused problem
1,Got the one with better config. Hangs way too much though I haven't installed anything yet. Takes half hour just to start. Not sure what's the problem but it annoys me too much.Better pay bit more money and buy a better one from other brands.
4,Good for personal use. But battery backup is not upto mark.
1,Defective screen....not easy return... It took my 1 month to return the defective product and get my money back... Worst experience!
1,Defective product not starting
5,Awesome laptop
4,I have been using this laptop from around three months and I am quite satisfied with the product.
1,Very poor plastic used in laptop bottom side.Display is also poor.Don‚Äôt buy .. I am regretting.
4,"Well built & faster than HP, battery backup is satisfactory. Overall one of the best laptop in market in this range"
1,"Overall very slow in performance, poor built quality, advise not to go for this, by the time I could return this the due date was over. Given for service."
5,I like the build quality but the charger is very ordinary.
1,Laptop camera is not working since day one and Lenovo support team denied on site support asking to go to service center. What's is the benefit on buying this product through Amazon.
4,The camera is lacking in Google meet and is slightly slow but overall it's good n great.
1,The brand and members which send this product they are not working on to improve the rating of their company and products. I received two times a laptop with keyboard issue.
1,Please dont buy this product.. this laptop is not working and there is no support from Lenovo to replace it.
2,Laptop works dead slooww. Very frequently freezes.Don't buy this laptop.Slowest laptop ever seen.
3,The battery life is so poor. Always needs to be plugged in for charging. And it's obviously slow due to less RAM capacity.
5,Good to goo
1,"Very bad laptop, Don't purchase lenovo laptop. Service is very bad."
5,Nice
4,Average battery life and poor camera.Rest is excellent.
5,nice value proposition
2,This product seems poor quality also shows hanging problem. under observation.
4,good product
3,Keyboard is very hard to use and no USB ports are provided at right side of the laptops.Go for any other make.
5,Good product
5,one of the best thermals out there intels new Alder Lake CPU with Nvidia RTX 3050 for smooth gamingpersonally using it and liked it so muchJust add another ssd for even better performance
5,"- I am using this laptop for about 15 days and if you need a future-proof laptop then this is the one.- The best part is the thermal system of this laptop, literally, this laptop doesn't heat up which definitely extends the life your laptop.- Almost all software available in the market is optimized to give the best performance with Intel processors and here you got the latest 11 generation intel i5 Hexa core processor.- The build quality is best, the design is awesome and the performance is powerful.- The typing experience you will get on this laptop is simply fabulous, better than Legion and Tuf laptop.- You can easily open the laptop lid with a single hand.- I use MATLAB and some CAD Softwares on this laptop which works very smoothly without any issue.- The battery life is not that good as it is a gaming laptop. It lasts around 3 to 4 hrs for multitasking and heavy work.- Recently, I have upgraded my laptop to windows 11 which is working fine.- The battery life is not that good as it is a gaming laptop."
1,I got a faulty product the charger wasn‚Äôt working and i ordered the 1tb 256ssd variant but i got 512ssd variant delivered which was faulty even thou on my invoice it mentioned the 1tb variant.
5,For gaming and productivity this is hell of a beast in this price range. Aah and yeah battery is not too good but it can easily survive for approx 2:30 hr of normal usage. And at first I got deffective piece but got replaced in 2-3 days which is impressive. Not writting long but at last  wanna say that its value for money. :D
5,Best gaming laptop in this range even after long hours of gaming it does not get much heated like the other laptops.  The display is amazing for gaming. Does not get heated fast can play for 3 to 4 hours without it getting heated.  Comfortable keyboard for gaming. The battery life is excellent for gaming laptop. I thought my charger was not working so I got in touch with the customer care and they were super helpful resolved my issue immediately actually the charger had to be pushed all the way it is a double push when it connects we hear a click sound.
5,"Make sure u insert the charger jack properly, u need to press it hard. Nak pichal pack aipoinai on kakapote."
5,"BATTERY IS A BIT LOW COMPARED TO OTHERS OF SAME PRICE BUT HDD AND SSD COMBO MAKES UP FOR THE LOSS, THERMALS ARE AWESOME.SERIOUSLY GO FOR IT IF YOU WANT BEST RTX 3050 LAPTOP, EVEN THOUGH THE TGP OF THE GPU IS A BIT LOWER THAN THE ROG STRIX G15, THE PERFORMANCE IS TOO BIG. HENCE GO FOR IT."
5,"Worth the money, if anybodys laptop is unable to charge up, remember to push the pin inside the charger port all the way in."
5,Super for gaming and editing
5,Good for gaming and editing.I love it.
5,Been using this for almost 3 months.. performance is great..audio is average but rest all are great.
5,I bought this laptop for multi tasking and this laptop nailed it.! Just ran gta 5 and pubg at a time and it worked without any lag. I had best experience with this.
5,Display quality compromise but company fix that but there is no firmware update through company
4,After replacement I got the Best Product..Worth For The Money..Fast Replacement...1st Photo where keypad lights are not working..2nd one which I got after replacement..
5,Good GamingGood Performance
5,Good laptop
5,Good product
5,Good laptop at this range. Laptop speed is fentastic. And looking good with rgb keyboard and the buttons of keyboard are also good.
5,Love the Laptop. If you're looking for an excellent gaming laptop under 70k this is the best choice.
4,"Go for it, it's a nice pick."
1,"This review is based on my purchase of Microsoft Surface Pro 4. The device in itself is very useful, but it has the worst issues with respect to hardware. I have replaced 4 Surface Pro and in March-20, the device again started with flickering issue. Please note that as on today (06Aug20), the device is not yet replaced even though the company claims replacement in 7 days. It is a nightmare when you are using it as a primary device.As mentioned earlier about the device replacement, note that when it comes to customer service, it is worst in India. the toll free number as usual never connects & if you chat, agents are sitting out of India and they don't know anything about service centers in India. The service center does not offer any help at all.Please do not waste money in this device. You may check out via normal google search about the issues with Surface devices. There will hardly be any positive comment."
1,m3 processor is still better at that price. intel gold processor at 55000 rupees is too much for it.
1,Pathetic pricing
1,different product received it ipad inMicrosoft box
4,"This is surface go 2.. some mix up in the descriptionDevice is awesome. Premium feel.Charges fast. Speed is good. No lag even with 10 tabs open in Microsoft edge browser with few other applications open. Can't jump to other apps easily in android tab or an ipad. Still using s mode. So no Google apps, no Adobe reader. Restricted app store. Type c port doesn't charge.My needs fulfilled."
1,"It's a waste of money. You cannot use it for most common purposes like installing google chrome, kindle app etc let alone programming. Disabling the S of the Windows heats up the device and makes it slow. Since it cannot be returned, need to find how to use it."
2,"Update # 1 september. The device is already dead and sent for warranty repair leaving my all my works pending.Poor choice my fault.... touch interface is not at all intuitive. To close a browser tab have to press 4 - 5 times. The default sleep option is horrible. It sometimes requires a reset as one click on the power button after sleep won't turn it on. Many may panic and think the PC is dead. The PC gets heating up horribly if you run any graphics related apps (even thr normal ones). And who uses DDR III at after 2019. Its madness. To top it all, windows 10 keeps releasing updates almost every week or fortnight squeezing every bit of your net pack. The only silver lining is its weight and portability. Constrained to buy windows PC for the sole reason that it supports productive apps more than other OS platforms. My bad."
1,"Exchange offer never works.. I mean never. I've tried twice to exchange with my Surface pro 2 i5. It's in excellent working condition. But pick up boy will just cancel. Once pick up boy just canceled without even coning to me. They're worried, in  the office they might get rejected. Very bad systems. Microsoft is giving us the opportunity to exchange and upgrade but Amazon is not able to execute the exchange transition.  I was barred to give reviews for surface. I've got 3 surface so far. I'm used to it that's the only reason I'm in to it..."
1,The product stopped working after 1 month of use. And neither Microsoft nor Amazon did anything about it. They just raised their hands and they said they can‚Äôt help me. I am so disappointed and I regret buying this product and from Amazon
1,God know why we bought this. Pathetic item and utter waste of money.. no good apps in this so can‚Äôt use like Apple or android tabs.Heating issue.Windows on small screen is no use for office work.So overall since we have bought this. Kept as display only and rarely used. Don‚Äôt go by YouTube video bloggers.. this is utter waste even for frequent travellers who works outside office.
5,"Price worthy. I don't think anyone should compare it with I pad air or samsung galaxy tab s6 , as all of them have different operating systems. One who is not very much fond of gaming may purchase it over others."
5,"The size, weight and speed are all just right- especially if you are able to supplement it with the keyboard that comes separately. I was not able to see much utility for the pen, which I had bought as well- it has also been a little more difficult to learn to use. No regrets on any front."
4,Its a product for students it is easy to use and It is smooth. Overall a nice product.
5,Works really well for me as I wanted a tablet that can also be a laptop on demand...
5,It‚Äôs the most trendy utilitarian device that you can ever get
2,My Laptop mic problem..sound not clear
5,Wow Superb as per my need
4,Did not get the latest processor and LTE
1,"this is not surface go 2,surface go 2 is 10.5 inch display"
1,"If microsoft wants their product to be a hit, then they have to price it same as usa pricing. Otherwise in india it will be a big flop."
3,"Cons-1- This laptop is way too expensive for a Pentium‚Ñ¢ gold Processor.2- The Sound is ok , but not the best.3- I would recommend to buy the ""Asus Vivobook Flip 14"" if you do want the touch screen4- The 64Gb storage model has EEMC storage , which is extemely slow.5- The screen is very small for a laptop.6- Not good for Programing .Pros-1- The Webcam is One of the best at this price.2- The battery life is Great.3- The screen quality is very nice.4- The surface pen works great5- The colour is nice6- Very portable"
1,Microsoft surface series is the worst that you can ever buy.I have a surface pro4 and the screen flickering issue is so bad that you can't work on it for more than 2 hours.If you want a cool looking device just to show off and not work on.. go for it. But if you really want a gadget to use... Just don't buy any product from Microsoft.
1,Go for lenovo flex or hp envy if possible .this product should be priced around 30-35k.Bad product from Microsoft
1,"Don't buy this. This laptop is being sold at a premium of almost 15k in India when compared to the US price. No idea who thought that was a good idea. You can import it for cheaper. Seriously, skip it."
1,No keyboard why u r calling it as laptop? Laptop consists of keyboard. It us just accessories.Go for many orherbrand far better than this
5,"Good product, but the accessories are hard to find in local market. Battery life is good 8hr or so."

3,"I am emphasizing on utility only. You can check videos for gaming performance/benchmarks.TL;DR:  Good laptop (visual/build/components) but bad value for money. Add 15k extra investment (ram + SSD) to justify this purchase.The important bits:- This is a 1650 + 8GB ram package. 69k is too much for this config. Last gen 1660ti + 16GB is going for 72k from MSI- HDD is 5400rpm. This drive's performance sucks. Frequent app hangs and MMOs are unplayable from it.- You cannot enter performance mode without charger plugged in.- Unlike most other laptops, this one throttles your CPU instead of reducing the fan speeds. So, forget about getting heavy work/gaming done while unplugged.Minor issues:- Buzzing noise in earphone (common issue due to internal placement)- The back-lighting will fall on your face if you use an external keyboard in front of laptop.Why make this purchase:- Excellent thermals due to four air vents and good vent design. Stays cool and quiet (but throttles your CPU. no way around that)- Very well-built and good looking chassis. It is more compact than most other gaming laptops, without sacrificing heat outlets.- ^ Ports on the back feel premium and professional.- Lenovo warranty is extensible till 4 years (On-site support)."
1,Very very worst product. Don't buy this waste of money. Got the defective product. Brightness looks like mobile reading mode which is so yellowish. Power button not working. Everything when i want to on my laptop. I need a technical supportüôÑ. I faced this issue on the day when i bought. They not ready to replace the item eith the new one
4,"Battery without charging will last for 2-3 hours when you are in gaming mode, overall a good laptop, if the battery life is enhanced then this can get all 5 starsPros:Laptop keys refresh rate is as promised in the descriptionHigh end Graphics can be easily managedFan cooling working smooth, controlling the MD heatUpdate on battery, it became stable after using it for 3 months (3-5hrs of battery life for now on full charge), shall update it, if something goes wrong from battery side"
4,"I will tell the cons first.1. 250 nits display. It's bad. It's really really bad. If you are outside or inside a room on a sunny day you will struggle to see the screen properly even in 100% brightness. This lap needed 350 or 400 nits display. My 9 year old Lenovo G580 was better than this.2. Touchpad. Another disappointment. If you are not using external mouse this touchpad will make you crazy. Still I couldn't figure out how it works properly.3. Camera quality is poor.Now pros* Superb built quality* nice keyboard* camera privacy shutter* SSD boots in seconds. It's awesome* Unless you are gaming, battery is good. I saw many reviews complaining about battery. But I never faced any issues. If gaming you have to plug in and play. In normal use I am getting battery upto 6 hours.* Decent sound* 120hz. Games are super cool.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-After 3 weeks usage:-I am loving this laptop more and more each day. It‚Äôs superb.* I am tuned to the touchpad. Now I make errors only once in a while.* Brightness is bad. Can‚Äôt see anything in day light.* when We play heavy games fan sound is high. I always use headset while playing. So I won‚Äôt hear the sound. The fan noise is high that one day I saw my mom searching everywhere to find from where some hissing noise is coming. üòÜüòÜ.* if not playing games I am really happy with the battery. Easily it lasts for 6-8 hours on normal use."
3,"No complaints about the product. It was exactly the same as I expected.But there is some problem about the warranty. One year warranty period was being shown as ""5 months remaining"". This is absolutely not acceptable. If this issue is not solved by Amazon, I shall not buy laptop, mobiles, and similar items in future.Otherwise, Amazon is good for small items, where warranty is not an issue."
5,This is a great laptop for gaming and for productivity.When I first brought this laptop I was not sure about the product but after using this it is the best Intel laptop you can get in this budget(73000rs).I really love the design of this laptop.
3,I love the laptop by looks and while working on it. It is very smooth and perfect in every aspect except for the battery. The battery's performance is abysmal. I didn't expect this from Lenovo. I am dejected with the way is battery is draining. It is not even lasting for the time it takes to get completely charged. Lenovo should really take this feedback seriously and try to take measures so that it won't let the customers down.
1,wrost productbattery life is not good. it gives one hour after full time of charge
4,But with gaming with background processes it showed some lag. Sound quality good. Battery with Dowland in process and movie watching lasted around 4 hours.
5,"This is the perfect laptop for Gamers , it doesn't feel like a gaming laptops , look like professional for both office use for creaters for vedio Editing .In one sentence we can say that it is allrounder ."
3,I am a Graphic Designer. Laptop battery backup 2-2.5hrs Max.
2,The product is good but price reduced by 3000 :-(
5,Best for gaming as well as office use.... Go for it üëç
2,"The Laptop keeps on freezing whenever your using it. How can, I resolve the problem?"
4,"Don't expect anything magical at this price point. It's an average laptop meant for average office work or study purposes. The laptop may seem laggy at the beginning, that's because of the pre-installed mcafee antivirus, just uninstall it and you should be fine. Would not suggest it for gaming."
5,"Updated : 30 April 2021Still working the same as on day 1. No issues so far. Update on battery life, i was wrong. It goes 6-8 hrs easily. If you go for another laptop, make sure that have SSD. It does magical performance improvements and increase battery life.---------This seems to be the best Laptop below 30K (got in 28500). Absolutely premium look and performance.1. Display is above average but not the best per FHD configuration.2. Performance is awesome, mainly due to Ryzen 3 and SSD memory.3. Fingerprint sensor is perfect.4. Very light weight and portable. Size is perfect.5. Sound is awesome.6. Battery goes up to 4-5 hrs easily.Cons: Power button is placed beside the Delete key within keyboard. Many times you go for delete but shutdown the laptop. I just disabled the action of power button from windows settings so nothing happen if I press power button accidentally. No issues now.Overall good for home/office use and can be worked on heavy coding applications too. But did not try games so no comments on that."
4,"I dont know whether my device is faulty or not, but I am observinf a weird issue right from the first day of usage. When I turn on the laptop everything is fine. Then if I close the screen lid and open it again after sometime the display becomes yellowish(like the night mode), but night mode stays off. If i restart the laptop, then everything becomes fine again. I hope this issue gets fixed by future software updates."
4,"Laptop is good for home use.  SSD, as expected makes a big difference to the speed. Not much bloatware.  Performance is great for home use. Office2019 works well.  No heating issues so far.  Laptop does have a good battery life atleast to last 4-5 hours with good use.4 (silly) things that the laptop could've done better with -1. Speaker volume is quite low. Video calls/conferences under a fan would be tough.  Can be sorted with a Bluetooth speaker.2. Camera is of decent quality, yet lacks an overall glass closure, that could've avoided dust settling within the camera cavity.3. As pointed out by few, the power button is oddly placed at the right end next to a heavily used delete key.  Within a couple of days, I  accidentally put the laptop to sleep atleast for 5 times. So, takes a bit of getting used.4. Base plastic feels a bit flimsy, but does hold up well. Not a big issue.Overall a great laptop for the price (29K) and none of the cons are deal readers for me."
1,I bought laptop for my sister for her study purpose and that's why I went for a budget laptop by asus.I personally trusted Asus company but with the experience with this laptop ruined it.Setting up itself takes very long time. And when the screen turned of the whole screen went scatterered with black image (I have provided the image).*Camera was too bad. Can't even use for any meetings.Definitely a defective product.I have placed for a replacement now.I will update it. if it get anything improved.Thank you
5,"This is budget laptop so there isn‚Äôt point talking about gaming. Laptop comes with 64bit windows 10 preinstalled for which 4GB ram isn‚Äôt enough . Either install one more 4 GB ram or else use 32 bit because only downside of this system is RAM idle windows 10 takes like 70% . Like every one already commented, remove macaffe antivirus completely, it slows the system a lot . Ryzen 3 is good enough for browsing, MS office , VC etc... power back up is really good. Finger print is nice addition on a budget laptop . No Ethernet port though but type C and type A 3.1 makes up for that. Overall it‚Äôs the best one this price range."
1,Very poor quality product .Completely unsatisfied  better buy from Store after checking.Defective product don't want money in it .Better buy from store
5,"#Design: 5/5... Nice build quality without metal body, doesn't feel cheap, keypad is at bottom with couple of mm from the surface in this new M415DA series, apart from M409DA.#Proformance: 5/5.. with 4gb ram and 256gb SSD along with its processor initially i found that its quite quick in booting up within 2-3sec even opening apps. Didn't find any issue like heating.#Battery: 4/5... First of all this model M415DA comes with 37whrs(M409DA comes with 32whrs & MI notebook eL comes with 46whrs) battery capacity. battery backup is at least 4-5 hrs. Charging is also good.#Screen: 3/5... It's not IPS display so viewing angles are not good. Specially white balance/light changes with different angles. Also asus optimization settings force screen to be yellowish anytime. This setting can be changed if you want.#Speakers: 4/5... Initially i found that the sound was very low. I changed some Realtek Sound Console settings and then the volume increased almost double. Now i have no problem with it.#Misc: ... Web cam is poor, useless in low light conditions although most laptop have same problem even in 35-45k price range. But good thing is you get FP reader which is quite fast."
5,Build quality and performance is good.. Ram/ssd upgrades are possible. 4 gb wasn't enough. I added a g.skill ripjawss 4gb additionally. Now it's very good and meets my basic needs.
1,"At starting for the first time itself is hanging like crazy. All apps crashing. The laptop has NO volume, even on 100 I've to stick ear near speaker to understand. It's a very slow laptop, rather you buy something with SSD"
5,"It is worth the value.Pros.Performance by Ryzen 3 and SSD is bestBooting time is 6 to 7 secsBody is durable metal chassisChiclet keyboard is goodHD screen with self adjusting brightnessWifi, Bluetooth connection is fastLED indicatorsNo gaming lags.Fingerprint sensors is too fastCons.Camera is not HD, but okay for video calls.The hinge is not that good, screen wobbles a little.But looking at the price its more than enough.Got it for 29990/- in Republic Day sale"
5,"*Important*: Uninstall McAfee antivirus as soon as possible. It slows down the laptop a lot. Also finish all updates from Microsoft.The laptop was very slow the first day, but after a week of use it has improved a lot.Pros:1. Good display, keyboard2. Pretty fast (easily runs CS GO on medium settings)3. Boot up time is pretty good4. Fingerprint scanner is very convenient5. Long battery lifeCons:1. Sound is dull, but I use earphones so it doesn't matter2. Average camera"
4,"I was looking to buy a sleek, light weight 14inch laptop...so I bought it after checking lot of reviewsPros - Laptop is sleek, Lightweight, Build quality looks good, has sufficient ports, HDMI Port is there, Large storage 1TB, Price is good, Licensed WindowsCons - Laptop becomes slow, I had a Thoshiba 7 year old laptop...some times i feel this laptop is slower than that laptop...may be because of new OS and Hardware...So planning to install SSD in this laptop to make it faster, Battery backup is ok ok..upto 3 hoursI recommend this laptop, for the people looking for budget laptop, and suggest them to install ssd in it"
1,"its looks , colour , compact size is fantastic . but its performance is slow , system freezing issue only solution is to shutdown and restart . sound quality is poor & low volume issue . its disappointing ."
4,"This laptop definitely need an m.2 nvme ssd to get that snappiness you will not like its performance with pre installed hard drive. Webcam is beloew average in this segment, screen quality and build quality is good. Overall you can consider this laptop but with an ssd upgrade."
3,1 ) Uninstalled HDD kit.2) No Backlit as it was mentioned in the product detail.3) Battery performance is very low .4) it's was mentioned that the storage will be of 256 GB and it's 237gb instead of 256gb......
4,It is a nice and a quick laptop in starting days it should work in future as it works now .but power button should be given seperatly sound should be more better than now overall all good thanks ASUS perfect laptop
2,Camera not working. Difficult to reach tech support. Customer hotline non responsive after holding for 10 minutes. Still in warranty but no use if one cant go through.
4,Everything thing is fine but camera quality is poor because of vga camAnd ram is only 4gb so you can upgrade for better performance
1,"Bought this laptop 2 days ago and it's lagging for no reason. Haven't installed any apps yet. I tried updating it to windows 11 but it gets stuck at 98%. When I tried restarting, it says ""getting windows ready, don't turn off your computer"". it's loading from 1 hour and still the laptop didn't start"
5,Very good product from Asus at this price range.... SSD is lightening fast.... Screen could have been better.... Sound is awesome.... Batter life is also good.... Overall it's a really nice laptop for working professionals and students....
4,It is a good laptop in this price range .laptop is little bit slow because it has only HDD.in this laptop ssd slot is available .overall laptop is good after using it for 1 week.
5,It's a laptop with all the things included to help the laptop run smoothly.Due to SSD included it gets started within fraction of seconds.Worth the price.Best for office use
4,"It‚Äôs good, not bad at all, Quality has been maintained, but sometimes the laptop automatically freezes, do not know if it‚Äôs the windows or the Ryzen processor. Battery is decent, could have been better, camera is average.Definitely not for hardcore working professionals but the best choice for students, impressive."
3,this laptop avrage camera quality bad and speaker sound low and display side angle colour blur. and battery 3hours working normal uses and design good performance good boot time is also good
5,You can and on it after ram and storage upgradation but don't recommend to game on itOther wise beast in small bugdetBattery is average of 4 to 5 will surfing Internet and 1.5 to2 Hour will gaming (NSF most wanted)If you are a student must buy if you have a small bugdet
4,Very Nice!Good Quality and features. Better performance than expected üíØ
5,"Laptop is very good in terms of design and looks. Screen is of decent quality, sound is very less. Good for medium works. Overall it's it's very good budget laptop..!"
1,"My 4-year old laptop (4GB RAM and 1TB HDD) and slower processor is twice as faster than this one!Probable cause could be '100% Disk Usage"" all the time.Would be happy to change my feedback if ASUS technical team helps to make it faster"
5,"Nice laptop, good battery Ok for normal work, light gaming can do internet surfing and more.Handy keyboard...low Web camera quality although enough.. average battery life 4 to 6 hours when on wifi, but upto 10 hours when offline."
1,"I ordered this laptop once, it was lagging so I replaced it when I  received replaced product it was having same issues. I suggest plz avoid buying it and save you money"
1,From day 1 itself Microphone jack is not working üò≠
5,"It is compact and user friendly, battery life is normal as well."
4,Lap is worth for 30 k rs most of the features are available but camera is very poor
2,"While using zoom or microsoft teams,laptop freezes very badly.Also it becomes slow after a force shutdown.I've uninstalled many unnecessary apps but problem cant be solved.Not worth the money."
3,Product is just ok. However MS office is getting stuck very badly. I think its issue with windows 10 version. As I don't have much business with MS Office this product caters my requirements.
4,"Good Laptop For Students & Business use , but not for gaming or multitasking or very high usage, runs good with 1tb harddisk but will work more faster if u add add & additional ram"
3,0.) Camera Quality is Very Bad.1.) Speakers sound us very low‚Ä¶2.) Performance is Achieved After installing Nvme M.2 SSD.
4,This product is good but there is one mistake in it is it's battery is not quite goodAnd the fingerprint is waste total waste is only to show off it doesn't scan properly
5,"The laptop is very good overall. The performance, disk, ram and aesthetics are very good. The only issue I faced was excessive screen bleed. Though the bleed is not visible unless the brightness is full and the device is seen in dark environment, I expect a manufacturer to ensure that customers get non-defective products. Even after replacement, the issue persists."
1,"Within a month of usage, today it all of a sudden stopped working - completely dead. No indication of charging light too when pluggged in... I was in middle of work.. Damn man, Never ever gonna buy lenovo again. Simply waste of money"
4,"Performance is Too goodWhen i compare with my previous Dell laptopReally good, booting so quickly, windows 11 is availableReview after the use of one month :- battery backup was really good  nearly 5-6 hours easily- performance was good- i didn't face any heating issueBut don't buy it for gaming propose"
4,Personal use
1,Laptop quality is good. Touch pads and screen clarity is good. Packaging was not that great.Cons: Battery backup is 3rd class. 100% battery get exhausted in 120-150mins.Even if u don't do anything on Laptop. Max 90-120 mins battery will work..if u r using Laptop. That sad and not accepted fr om lenovo.

5,Value for money
5,Amazing product with an excellent configuration. I am in between an intermediate and a heavy tech savvy computer user and have been using various computers over 20 years now.I was quite cryptic before buying this one with only 2 reviews (at the time I purchased).But this is a good laptop at great price.People need to understand that SSD should be a primary choice of storage now when you buy an i3 laptop and expect it to be fast.Do not buy this if you play games or plan to run some heavy apps on it.It is a decent product for everyday use such as browsing and office apps.
5,"Review for V15 SSD version (Not V14):I search for entire local market of Nagpur but could not find the SSD version but HDD version was available in local market. I wanted to buy SSD version for office and this worked perfectly. I bought 5 qty for office.1. 15"" screen2. 4GB RAM3. 256GB SSD4. Good battery backup upto 5 hrsI have added 8GB extra RAM so total with 12GB RAM, the laptop works at lightspeed."
5,"Very good Laptop. Compact, Fast, Ultra Slim, Hinge moves 180 degrees. Startup is just 10 seconds. Microsoft office and mcafee free for 30 days. Only camera should have been better. The rest is absolutely fine."
4,Battery:The battery is built in to the laptop & hence not external. The battery readings (time left) appear to be erratic.Response: Response time is very short because it has an SSD instead of HDD.
5,Good product... it's truly an value for money... battery life is amazing..but the camera quality is very bad.. over all this is a good laptop in a good price.
5,Authorised and genuine seller
4,"At this price as per my perspective, the configuration and performance is good. This color is something look like old one after seeing on second day itself, there were hand prints on the front side after touching it :)."
3,I have bought dis lappy once a week ago in 32000 online . Web cam is not good quality. Battery will not last more than 2 hours. I am not satisfied wid battery but it's good.1 more thing is that amazon is taking 2000 extra money for this.it will nt be more than 30 thousand.
3,Pros:Sleek and slim.Nice speed.Cons:Display quality is poor.It does not have MS Office.
4,I did some research and finally got it.A good laptop with light weight but slight weak battery.Overall performance is good laptop is fast.I will update further after using it six months.
4,"Good design, anti-glare, keystrokes feel good. Just that dual boot gave too many issues. Couldn't do it till the end"
3,Quality is good but Battery life is very bad .
1,Windows crashing issue üòî. Don't know why it is happening. Don't waste your money üí∞
5,Value of money and best laptop üíª
4,Good product
5,Good
4,Value for money
5,Dam good laptop for this price
4,"This is one of the better value for money laptop you could find online. Its got latest i3, SSD ,a decent HD display. I only gave it 4 star because of its RAM which is only 4Gb, atleast ,8GB would have be great. Anyway you can upgrade it if you feel that your laptop is slowing down after sometime. It would cost around 3-4k INR.Some compromises where indeed made, but its not right to pin point everything which would otherwise don't matter to most users.Pros:-----------1- i3 10th gen ifor this price2- SSD storage is an added advantage for faster app opening and boot speed3- Windows 10 runs really smooth4- Display is antiglare5- Battery life is decent at 4-5hours6- Build is all plastic but its surprisingly good. It can take a beating.7- Speaker quality is good but not loud, so consider buying a Bluetooth speaker for better audio experience.CONS:----------1- Display quality is bad when compared to laptops with IPS display2- For some reason I am facing issues with premier pro. It just hangs after sometime. Probably seems like a bug.3- KB is not backlit. :(."
1,Please don't purchase this laptop. Due to poor battery and screen resolution. U should go with dell and hp only.
4,"Applications are very slow. Need help, I mean, it needs to increase the ram or their is any settings. Pls help us."
4,A very compact laptop for general use
1,Very slow than other i3 device ! Don‚Äôt buy it through any online shop better to go market and buy a genuine device doesn‚Äôt matter if cost is bit high.
1,Useless
5,"After a long wait for good budget friendly in i3 10th, finally got this. Light weight, 14inch easy to carry and good performance with daily task. great service from Amazon. Very happy."
1,Worst product with high price üò°üò°üò°üò°Small keyboard without number padüò°Audio mobile is better than thisüò°For animation & multimedia this is waste üò°for gaming useless I returned it üò§
1,"Amazon has luckily assured me of refund .1)Sound quality of speakers is really bad .2)The designer of keyboard should be fired , even the basic dedicated keys like Home n end have been coupled with direction keys , leave about numeric keys .The keyboard messes  my typing . They had plenty of space to utilize .3)Laptop seems to be slow when compared to the processor under the hood .Not good for multimediaOnly positive thing I felt was the screen while watching youtube video's but then that is not the reason for buying a Core I7 processor enabled lappy .I am totally dissatisfied with my purchase .Hope Amazon issues refund fast"
5,Video Player is loading.
4,"Battery life is normal ,it doesn't have camera"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS
1,Screen bleeding issue ...replaced the product even then also the issue is there
5,Great buy. Latest and the best.
1,"SirWith great excitement I ordered ......laptop hoping that it would be very useful. But yesterday when I checked the laptop after receiving its delivery,  to my utter dismay,  the battery of this laptop is found to be defective.  I trusted Amazon a lot as it is an esteemed company who take care of the interests of its consumers.  I and all my family members are customers of this esteemed company for the last many years.But the defective laptop has disappointed me a lot. All my happiness has diminished.I have consulted my friends and relatives.  All have advised me to return this defective laptop saying that if this is the situation at the initial stage,  it may further concern me in future.So please get back your defective laptop at the earliest and please don't sell such defective pieces in future as all customers have great trust upon you but such incidents dampen their belief.Hope you would very soon get the defective laptop back and refund my money backRegards"
3,"What you get:1. A laptop where you can edit documents, browse, consume media and/or entertainment.2. Snappy start as it has an NVME SSD3. Can play tiny indie games, all thanks to the lowest possible RAM4. Easy access to hardware upgrade, this is the best I've seen5. RGB backlit keyboard if you are into that sort of thingWhat you don't get:1. You cannot play AAA games, as the FPS will be around 30 to 45FPS. I'm a PC gamer and anything below 60 is considered unplayable for me. If you are a console fanboy, you may like it.2. Laptop bag.3. MS office.4. Sufficient RAM. The 8GB in board RAM is insufficient for gaming.5. A good touch pad. Touchpad is annoyingly laggy. This seems to be an issue when the laptop gets hot. Over all the touchpad doesn't feel right.What you have to buy additionally to make this a worth while purchase.1. 8GB 3200 C22 RAM (I bought Crucial 8GB for 3k). This is a mandatory upgrade, without this the laptop is equivalent to a 30k laptop.2. Good mouse (got logitech wireless mouse for 599). Nice to have.3. Get a decent bag if you don't have one.4. If you play AAA titles, I'd recommend Samsung 980 500gb. Costs about 5999. Or Corsair P2 for 4.5k the speeds almost match samsung 980.5. Get a good cooling pad. As this reduces the temperature by a good 10¬∞C. Ensuring longevity of the product. You'll get decent one at 750 to 1250/-."
2,It's a good laptop indeed. But I bought it for 75990 and now it has increased its price to 81000.  What is this. It was already overpriced for its specs. Now this. Amazon needs to do something about this.  Now.  i5 11300h. Good one. But 4 cores is a but of a letdown. Rtx3050. Good one. Asus the laptop and softwares they've provided. Very nice. I personally wouldn't recommend this laptop since it's overpriced now.
1,I ordered it on 11th of October and received it on 14th quite excited about the laptop and my Friend who have Asus Rog strix also there inorder to check the benchmarks of both the laptop. I played Valorant i got 70-80 in Top setting where he got 144 fps and it also has screen bleeding issuesPros-Laptop Body looks good and its attractiveCons-Screen bleeding since the day i got it ü•∫-Fps around 70-80 in valorant in RTX 3050 but got 140+ in 1650ti üò∂-While playing it in Turbo mode the heat comes through the keyboard and overheatNB :- If you have 70k you can look for another best laptop its a gross
1,"Screen display is having white spots, called Amazon guys and arranged a technical visit which didnt happen at the selected time slot and the ticket got completed without technician visit.Again raised a complaint, submitted pictures but no avail. Just got another date for technician visit. Too much disappointed with so costly product and Amazon service."
4,Atleast should have given MS office package or Laptop bag or any accessories.Anyways very good.
4,"This is i5 11gen RTX 3050 model which I got for 69k. Every other laptop in this price range generally comes with GTX 1650 hence I decided to try out RTX 3050. Mind that it is 75W powered so you might noy be getting whole out of your GPU power.Looks wise - White color looks just amazing though if you are a tough user then it may stain quickly also build quality is good the front frame is metallic which feels great.Performance- This is where things lacks when you buy a 70k machine you want it to give atleast150-200 FPS in CSGO or any equivalent FPS shooter. But to my surprise it barely managed to give an avg of 100 FPS. Man that low considering this is a 70k laptop.Battery - Battery kinda good considering it is a gaming laptop thanks to iGPU mode and other battery efficient options.Camera- It doesn't have one.Display - Nice display not the greatest one but a decent one.Sound- I just use it with my headphones on, So speakers doesn't matter to me. But if you are someone who use laptop speaker for any work then you might not like the sound.Weight- It's a 2kg machine. That nice considering its a gaming laptop.Final Verdict- If you are looking for a gaming  laptop which also has a professional look to it you may go with it. Performance wise it's good but didn't meet my expectation.Update- I just upgraded to 16gb and now its got a huge performance boost. Initially I was getting 90-100 FPS in Valorant but Now it gives 170-200 FPS."
5,This is the only laptop which is available in the market for 85k.. Which has rtx 3050..intel i7 11th gen processor and 16 gb ram.I have been using this laptop for over a month and i would say its an absolute gaming beast. I play valorant at 60 fps without any frame drop and the cooling of this laptop is awesome.. Just place it on a stand and it would be much better.I mainly use this device for editing works... So the latest adobe versions can be run smoothly without any problem in this device.The only small problem is the battery life...its give around ony 4 hrs of normal useage.. But this is a problem which comes with every gaming laptop.So overall a great product.
1,And they are not even giving replacement for the same. Though I am a regular buyer from Amazon.
5,"well i must say this beast was more than i expected....i got it in 69990 in Diwali festival offers...but i would say i must recommended ...i checked..so far no issues are there...if you are taking this for gaming...i prefer you to take i7 ...i5 works well though...and the laptop is awesomeüî•üî•üî•...built quality, working and all.....go for it without without a thought...also i thought that this would be a defective piece...but i checked everything...there is nothing wrong...and This si complete budget gaming laptop if you want to buy!!!!!"
4,"Been using it for around a week and a half now, so far the experience has been good, I've faced no issues or inconveniences and everything seems to work well.Some good things about this laptop are the battery, the 144HZ refresh rate monitor, armoury app and the keys to change fan speeds manually.The GPU in this one seems underwhelming since it's an RTX 3050, even though it performs better and has additional features than the 1650, it still doesn't feel like a massive difference. For me this is a huge upgrade since I was using a pentium laptop and getting around 30-50 fps in most games but now with this I have anywhere from 60 - 250.  So I'm definitely enjoying this. Do not hesitate to buy an RTX 3050 if you have this tight budget, it is certainly future proof since it's a new arrival though I would highly recommend you get your ram upgraded to 16GB as soon as you buy this, it'll help avoid dissapponting fps."
5,using it after 2 weekspros..1.awesome battery life around 7-8hrs2.good screen3.keypad and trackpad is good . I'm liking it.4..speaker is like  ok ok .5. gaming experience was good.  like 110fps in valorant in high setting and 60-75fps in warzone in recommended setting(single 8gb ram).cons.1. no inbuilt camera (but you can use my asus aap to share cam of your phone in laptop)2. no ms office 365
3,"The product arrived on time, setup is fast and easy. Unfortunately, the keyboard of the unit was malfunctioning - it prints ',' when you press '@' and vice versa. Then there are multiple keys misbehaving like that.Now the problem starts: You contact customer service and they ask repeatedly same basic questions as if we are computer illiterate. Once you go through that pain, they will send a series of software to download and test. Now if you had that much patience and after few hours, you upload the images to the link they provide, they agree to accept replacement. Now after 2 days, no return label, you contact CS again.You go through the basic questions again and now you lose patience. Long story short, finally a technician was able to create a return order.Some of the questions asked:""was it in a moist environment""""was it dropped""So, the person should at least understand - the keys will not type wrongly (no chance of a short circuit, if the keys are consistent) if any of the above things happened. It is a defective keyboard and manufacturing defect."
5,Build quality is great. Body flex is minimum and hinge feels strong. Overall good laptop with great specs
1,No work/Normal use of laptop heat medium screen bleeding issue
4,"Display is superb and worth buy for ‚Çπ68,000 never feel any lag and happy with the perfomance i5 11th rtx 3050 completely make this laptop a beast üî•"
1,This product not have Camara .when i talk to amazon customers  they say we can not replace  products
5,best deal .. only 1 minus point.. web cam not in this product....
4,A little screen bleeding
5,Performance wise is a decent machine..and no thermal issues.
5,i like it whole except battery it has some little battery issue
5,Video Player is loading.
1,"Do not buy this laptop from here. They are trying to get rid of their faulty stock. Read in another review that the person got faulty machine and he got a replacement. Thought it might be a one off. I was also sent a faulty laptop when I ordered...pixels were not lighting up properly in a spot. I was able  to apply for a replacement but they messed up the details of the laptop they were picking up from me. I spent about an hour with the delivery person trying to resolve it, with him on his phone talking to his Amazon contacts and me on my phone with Amazon customer care but they were not able to fix it. So be prepared for the replacement to be delayed as well, when you get the faulty laptop. Also, if you paid extra for one/same day delivery, it is not refunded in case you have to return the laptop. So you pay extra money and still can't use the laptop as soon as you expected it to.The replacement they gave me was also faulty...one of the letters in the logo on the back of the screen was missing(the glue came off or wasn't stuck there properly during manufacturing). So again talked to customer care about this. They said they can refund my money but not fix the machine or replace it(replacement limit is one).So you will have to buy the laptop again if you get a faulty machine as replacement and no guarantee that second time you order, you won't get a faulty machine. This is because they might send you someone else's rejected machine or one from their faulty stock where they have not even done basic quality checks like looking for visible exterior damage or screen issues. This is something they definitely check for, if you are exchanging your old phone/laptop/other electronics.I am going to try to use the Lenovo warranty to get the issue fixed and hoping some other issues don't pop up."
3,Worst display and poor audio and heating issues more .I never recommend this lapi to anyone
4,"After initial hiccups on Warranty and ADP, able to use the laptop for few days and it has excellent performance and elegant look. Really good quality in this price for a such configuration. Liked it!!"
1,"My office 2019 is not installed, and neither lenovo is helping me to do this nor the seller, to solve the problem."
4,"I have been using the laptop for the past three months. Here are the pros and cons.Pros:1. Battery life : lasts around 4-6 hours of normal usage (with zoom active for an hour)2. The hinge is a bit sturdy, unlike the other Yoga series. Although, it is certainly not robust to problems, because it is made of plastic.3. Computationally, the laptop has been satisfactory. Speed is good. It did hang twice, but that was because Windows was updating in the background.4. I have been using OneNote for taking notes. The response is good, but it is the same response you would see in a Yoga 500 or 700 series. Would expect a much better response at this price.5. Camera quality is really good and comes with camera shutter. You can close it when not it use.6. Laptop is really very lightweight.7. No heating issue observed when on battery. Although it does get a bit hot when on charge.Cons:1. Although display is decent, since it has an Amoled display, the darker colors are shown clearly, but the brighter colors are not that good. But it is better compared to laptops of this range.2. The material at the back of laptop does get dusty and it is not easy to clean. I use a lens cleaner to clean it weakly. It mostly is like a dust magnet.3. Audio is extremely poor. The speakers are not at all good.4. No HDMI port and ethernet port. Although most of the laptop in this price range don't have one either.5. There is a bug called FMAPP which lags your key presses. It can be removed using task manager.6. Cannot be used for gaming. This is certainly not a gaming laptop, so you wouldn't expect it to perform well."
4,Lenovo really nailed it. First charge may heat your laptop more. After subsequent uses it reduces heat up issue and also improves battery life. Battery life>11hr i tested it. it is increasing day by day. initially it gave me <8hr backup but now it is giving me almost 12hrs backup.Only once concern- i can not switch off touch pen.
2,"Product seriously heating up at least the one I got ! Even if I do nothing, laptop's Fan is still working and the heat comes only from 1 of the 2 grills !Other than that I literally don't have any complaints."
3,"Problems which made me seriously consider returning/replacing the 2 in 1 laptop:1. The laptop runs into a Blue Screen Of Death a few minutes after boot every time (APC_INDEX_MISMATCH) and2. Sometimes, on startup, the Wifi icon disappears - which means the Wifi card is not detected in Device Manager as well._______________________________________________________________________________________________But there is a solution to this:1. Uninstalled the AMD Radeon Software and downloaded and installed the newest and latest driver that is stable.2. Opened the back lid and swapped the Intel AX200 Wifi  card with another one (Qualcomm Atheros) from an older laptop.3. Lastly, in the AMD Radeon Software UI box, under Preferences, turn off In-Game Overlay.After this, No More BSOD."
4,"I brought this laptop, but it was having a manufacturing defect, its sound speakers were blown and. But overall product was in good quality.I rated this as 4 star just becoz. The AMAZON replaced this laptop for new one and i am very much satisfied to their service.The replacement was done within 5 days. And the new product is working good for now."
5,"It is powerful yet sophisticated...Firstly, the fabric cover does gives it an unique look. It also provides a good grip while carrying it in hand. The Ryzen 7 4000 series along with the ram is pretty fast. In terms of display quality, battery life, audio intensity, touch and stylus: the experience is amazing. The keyboard has a great travel, touchpad is quite smooth and the fingerprint sensor makes switching on to the system effortless. And I could just go on with the features... also I've been using it for around 2 weeks now... and I haven't confronted any such cons to be mentioned...Overall it's a really good laptop and worth it's price, in my opinion."
4,"Bought two of these laptops at 78,900 INR couple of months back. Works great, light weight, comes with stylus, FHD IPS display, Windows 10 home, Office applications, AMD 4700U processor, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD. Lid comes with Fabric cover. Web cam is of average quality, sound is very less even at full volume. Just ok for video conferencing. Keyboard is backlit and near to no noise. No card reader or no HDMI port. Price is also now unreasonably increased from 78900 INR to 89,900 INR in less than two months and at this price it is not worth. Overall not worth the price!"
1,Worst please don't buy
5,"Well what can I say, this laptop suits my purposes perfectly. Its lightweight, sleek, has touchscreen, comes with a stylus, has a powerful enough processor, and is damn beautiful. For people like me who have to carry their laptop for work and travel this is an ideal choice. On the downside the display is not well suited for a bright sunny day. Overall very pleased with the purchase. For this price range I would definitely say its a bargain to get such a 2 in 1 laptop. 5 üåü"
1,"Out of blue suddenly NVME SSD failed on the laptop and Lenovo representative came after more than 2 weeks and only replaced SSD and did not installed Windows. its been 5 weeks plus and laptop is still dead. Lenovo had only only one response ""we understand your problem but give us Engineer number who attended your call and we will reply back"" they do not care about customer service as long as product is sold and will do everything to ensure product warranty period is lapsing as much as possible.Simple suggestion : Dont buy Lenovo products as they are inferior quality and worst customer services you can get. Lenovo should only focus on selling cheap laptops to corporate are exuberant price who don't expect after sales service and will replace hardware than repair it."
5,"Very good laptop‚Ä¶ too light weight‚Ä¶ too comfortable to touch @ it‚Äôs screen, smooth‚Ä¶ good processing internet fast! It‚Äôs too high value for u to use, lots!"
5,"Look wise it's so good. Performance is as expected but heating problem is there. Even for one hour usage, producing more heat and not able to keep on my lap."
1,We bought this in india and traveled to the UAE. One side of the screen has gone bad...no proper support from Lenovo United Arab Emirates
5,So far it is a super fast laptop. I have installed several softwares for doing software development work. Laptop doesn‚Äôt lag at all.
5,"Good laptop for end use. Will be compatible with win 11. Children love the touch screenSeller gave a good piece as well. Apparently some other sellers give refurbished, damaged items but this is fine."
5,Perfectly meets my requirements
1,Amazon shipped defective product and now i am struggling for refund.
5,Video Player is loading.
5,Its just worth the price. Amazing speed and so smooth performance.
5,"Killer performance. If only the battery life is improved, I'd settle with this laptop for life!"
4,Value for money
4,"Good processor, good battery life."
1,Lenovo and Amazon not providing services
4,"I ordered this laptop from the lenovo website during its pre-booking. Got a wireless mouse and backpack for Rs.1/- each and the laptop for Rs.77,000/- after applying some bank offer. Now coming to the laptop itself, this is how I'd score it:Build Quality:  4.0/5Screen:  4.5/5Keyboard:  4.2/5Sound:  4.0/5Battery Backup:  5/5Performance:  4.8/5Pros:- An awesome processor (Ryzen 7 4700U 8 cores and 8 threads) runs everything smoothly. Be it multiple chrome tabs or adobe softwares like photoshop and illustrator. It's not a gaming laptop but you can do casual gaming on it.- The fabric cover on the lid gives it a unique look. Overall a premium looking device.- Decent keyboard to type on and the sound from speakers is above average.- Hinge is good and sturdy. Better than the one on HP Envy x360.- Type C charging.- Great battery backup. I was comfortably getting more than 9 hrs. by doing normal usage (browsing web, running YouTube, watching movies).- Privacy shutter on the webcam is a nice feature. I think more laptop manufacturers should implement this.Cons:- The keyboard deck flexes a lot. The top is aluminum but bottom is PC + ABS plastic. It is a good quality soft-touch plastic though. Would've loved to see an all metal body at this price.- Ports selection is limited. No SD/microSD card slot.- Webcam quality is just like any other laptop. Will get your work done (Google meet/zoom/team meetings).- No Windows hello facial recognition (Only fingerprint scanner which works fast & precisely, no complaints there).P.S. This laptop comes with a lenovo pen which runs on a single AAAA battery (not rechargeable obviously). It has pretty low latency and supports pressure sensitivity."
3,"This is my early review will post long term review later on.I brought this laptop from the Lenovo store using amazon pay a week before writing this review. It cost me 75k after the amazon offer (2k cashback).I was looking for 2 in 1 laptop with an 80 k budget and this laptop fits the profile. compare to AMD, 11th gen intel was costing more.My choice was an AMD processor, 16Gb RAM(not upgradable in most laptops), 512ssd, better screen quality(sRGB coverage).Lenovo yoga 6 fits this specification well while other laptops with the same price tag either have non-upgradable 8 Gb RAM or poor screen quality.(60%sRGB coverage)intel processor was costly with the same configuration with equal performance.Compare to Ideapad  Flex 5 AMD 7 it cost 5k more but has the better build quality and premium look, more portable, better screen quality, and the only downside is it has AMD 7 4700u while Flex has AMD 7 5700u which is faster but in daily life, it does not make much difference.BUILD QUALITY: Good, feels premium.4/5SCREEN & TOUCH: Nice display with average brightness suitable for indoor but it is glossy make life difficult with all the reflection. The Touch  is accurate and responsive.3/5KEYBOARD AND FINGERPRINT: Good and works well.4/5DAILY USE AND MULTI-TASKING: 4/5BATTERY: 3.5/5PORTABLE: 4/5 Lightweight and easy to carry.OTHERS:  the Laptop heats up while charging.Opening the lid of the laptop with one hand is a nightmare.Tried to run games(AAA titles) on it, as expected it can't"
1,"I‚Äôve purchased this laptop from UK. It‚Äôs touch screen stopped working within 6months of purchase. It‚Äôs battery is not upto the mark as well, it didn‚Äôt last over 3hrs."
3,"Everything is perfect in this laptop, just that the screen show too much light reflections. (alternate option is to go for Matte/Anti Glare screen in this model)Buy only if you've seen this model physically and are okay with the screen.else all other configs are super."
5,"I have not seen a laptop like this before. It comes with a blue fabric finish on the top which looks really unique. Its really awesome. You have to see it to believe it. The laptop is super fast with the Ryzen 7 CPU with 8 cores and 16 threads. Overall, I am in love with the laptop and would recommend it to any one who wants to purchase a lifestyle product. Definitely worth the money."
1,"Never buy a lenovo product ,They don't have any after sale support ,They just want to sell the cheap quality product and then there is no support if there is any problem"
5,Bought it from Lenovo. Got 3 years ADP for 1499 only. No issues what so ever. Speaker volume is a bit on the lower side however it does not matter to me as I use it for work. For few who watch Netflix it may be considered low. I did read few reviews people mentioned it over heats however I am not sure why they need to burn there laps. Keep it on table man. Moreover if the guys are talking about the fan remember its AMD. My other machine is i7 and it makes noise too. Go for it guys.
5,Excellent innovation by Lenovo ... fabric design is awesome....light Weight look premium...feel and finish of laptop is really nice... great product highly recommend... battery life is also awesome you gonna luv it
5,"Like its battery life, light weight, performance all over it is nice product Velu of money sound quality is also very good ."
5,"Speed Performance is awesome.. sound average. Looks is good .. camera is bad, bad means bad. Plustic build..."
5,"Good Laptop, Fast finger print sensor boots fast thanks to SSD, at this price range Good for basic day to day work.Mine, Sliver coloured is a finger print magnet, it should have been a Matt finish.MSOffice365 is a trial version- 5days free usage, after that it requires purchase."

5,good one.. booting time also fast.. inbuild ms office
5,I like this product so much The keyboard is very smoot and it's processor is very good. I am using it last 1 month and every time my family member used. It will shut only at night. And we will start working on it from 9 am in the morning
5,Just go for this laptop.....as it is solid slim and thin laptop in this price range....just ignore everything nd go for it .....totally satisfied
2,"no ethernet, no backlit keyboard, flickering screen, waste of money...."

1,Is there anything to like? Defective and refurbished items are sold on amazon. It is useless product. Never buy anything from this site
1,"Keyboard is not working for a new laptop, then see how the Acer Laptop products are. Suggesting plz do not buy any ACER PRODUCT LAPTOPS.  I also called Acer Service station and they are creating service tickets and assigning the work to a third  party service stations in Hyd.

2,Very very slow. Design price weight all fine but performance is poorIf we open more than 1 Window it is getting stuck
4,"Firstly, you get what you pay for. At 25k, this laptop cannot be expected to support heavy gaming or software. That being said, it's a perfectly functional laptop for normal browsing, movies and ms-office/light other work.The laptop comes with a bunch of bloatware pre-installed (both windows 10 and lenovo). However once you remove them, performance drastically improves.Boot time: 5-7 seconds (give it a minute to wake up properly, grouchy until then)Battery: 5-7 hours normal use ( decreases based on type of usage)Build quality: glossy top, otherwise build quality is meh (again 25k)USB speed: very good.. 30 MB/sPrivacy shutter: little cost cutting here, but functionalKeyboard: good enough to use, num pad is useful for ExcelScreen quality: no pixel issues, good enough for regular use ( again 25k)Bulky: not so much actually, it's quite sleek and my sister is happy with itOverall verdict: totally worth the price. No regrets buying."
3,"Battery life is not much as written in specification (approx 3-4 hr).Performance is average, takes time to open apps and booting.Thing that is good in this laptop is its Audio and video quality."
1,Product is very disappointing and i have issues with speaker in the first 7 days of buying . Who'm to blame ? No replacement policy applicable and all i've now to do is get down to the Service center and waste my time fixing it . The system is very slow and I'd definitely not purchase Lenovo again . Thanks for your service!

If u r buying the mobile for this feature then I'm afraid u may get disappointed, it's just normal.The USB cable is too small in lengthIt's a good mobile in this budget, there are no returns for this,  only replacement is available, hence choose wisely before buying"
3,Camera quality is low
1,"1. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.2. Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one.3. Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.4. No return policy, you will have to live with the phone you didn't like. Now you decide."
1,"Not worth buying....faulty software, poor display quality, single band wifi doesn't support  5ghz WIFI band. Gyro sensor missing and many more. DONT GO BY PAID REVIEWS IN YOU TUBE"
5,"In this budget, it has exceeded all expectations .. I have primarily taken this phone for the battery and so far not disappointed"
1,I will never purchase Samsung phones. Phone is lagging too much and slow. Waste of hard earning money.

1,Don't received  handset ejection  pin  and manual.
5,Just unboxed the phone.Seems to be a better one in this price segment as of now.Just checked with the camera & voice it seems good but one thing it's very heavy in weight may be due to battery.Hope samsung lives upto expectation.
1,very poor build qualityvery poor camera piclow quality phoneno return policyvery worst mobilejust making fool to customer by samsung m12 and Amazon
1,Hitting issue
1,Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don't waste money on this product.
1,"Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price."
5,"This is perfect phone, good speed, decent specs and outstanding battery life. The look of the device is also attractive. Above all, the trust of company."
1,"PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
1,"Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don't buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI."
1,Dislike
2,"Product specifications are not at par..Display is below average.Camera quality is just okay..It doesnt support 5ghz wifi, which is not mentioned anywhere so please make sure before buying.."
1,Self camera is just like 2 mega pixels.
1,"The user experience is pathetic on these cheap phones. Its filled to the brim with bloatware that you can't remove.You're better off getting the Mi phones as they have a far better UIAlso, I can't return this garbage of a phone as Samsung don't list this as a software issue.I'll have to look into installing lineage os and de-google this phone before using it but that's easier said than done."
1,Just for name sake Cam & Battery are 48mp & 6000mah. But coming to reality it is poor. The weight of the phone also almost 250gm so it is not a smart phone it is a hard phone. And the top menu bar beside front cam is not responding sometimes.
5,"A very satisfying  experience with the device so  far.Pros:1. Long battery life-  I am a moderate  user who does everything  except gaming. That said , the battery lasts up to 2 full days.2. Decent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.3. Very responsive finger print sensor.4. Good sound quality, although dolby's impact  is not much pronounced5. UI is great and snappy. Lots of customization options.6. The display is good and smooth with 90hz refresh rate. It does make the difference.7. Fast charging works fine.Cons:1. The weight of the phone is on the heavier side @ 220 gms2. The display could have been a full HD+ @ 1080p3. No led notification light. All though there are apps that can do the job on an AMOLED screen.Overall, a good package."
1,Horrible product
1,"Not a good mobile.Quite heavy in weight, you will obviously feel it. Weight is 220 gms which is far exceeding acceptable range. Can definitely be used as paperweight.Nothing special in screen, processor or camera also.Just a marketing gimmick by samsung.Stay away.. At 13.5k we deserve far better than this."
3,Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn‚Äôt give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you‚Äôre choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you‚Äôll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review
4,I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1. Battery and Camera.1. BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non sense.I played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98% to 80 %2. Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this
1,Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp
1,"This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information."
5,"It's a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they're wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it üòå. Once again no complains regarding anything."
1,Look is average. Battery life is good. Only go ahead if you just need a good brand name otherwise 100 of options are available in market. You will definitely get disappointed with camera which is actually not more than 12 mega pixels.  This phone nothing but a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached. Samsung must call back these phones as it is definitely going to kill the brand name. I will highly appreciate if Amazon has the guts to publish this review. This is an open challenge to Amazon...
2,"The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box"
4,"Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage .  I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck .Awesome battery life , and that's what I want . I am just using it for basic social media and calls .. rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device .CAMERA is average , My ipad's 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called ""true"" 48MP.My advice-- go for 6gb variant as 2.5 gb is acquired by the system .Overall - 4‚òÜ"
1,"Disappointed with this mobile.... PhonePay & GooglePay apps are not working properly.... Numbers visible only half and getting overlapped....and we're end up typing wrong Pin numbers.... multiple times we have changed the Pin for these apps... now a days We regularly use mobile for online payments but this mobile is not useful for online payments due to app issues.We have tried to return this mobile, but Amazon return policy date was over by the time we found the issue."
5,I am using this phone for the last one week and i noticed few positive and negative things about it.Positive points -‚Ä¢ Fingerprint sensor is so fast and i loved it‚Ä¢ Battery backup (6000 mAh) is amazing even after using it throughout the day‚Ä¢ Camera quality is really good and the pictures are amazing on day light‚Ä¢ Large display having a size of 6.5 inches and can run games smoothly on low graphic settings‚Ä¢ 90Hz refresh rate feels so smooth‚Ä¢ The phone doesn't lag or get heated after using it for a long time because of Exynos 850 (8nm) high-end processorNegative points -‚Ä¢ Not made for hard-core gaming because the processor is not strong enough to run games smoothly on high graphics‚Ä¢ The weight of phone is heavy‚Ä¢ The brightness level is somewhat low as compared to other phones‚Ä¢ The display that you will get is around 720 x 1600 pixels‚Ä¢ The downloading as well as uploading speed is also low as compared to other phones within this price range‚Ä¢ It is not water resistant and does not have Gorilla glass for screen protection .~ I am satisfied with this phone because of it's camera quality and battery backup ‚àö
1,Received damaged product. really disappointed.
1,Backwash phone no good phone cheap pro. Mediatek 720 screen TFT and battery charger  slow 15 watt only like 10000 phone ..nothing good..samsung very poor phone ..don't buy in 20000 ...TFT like 5000 phone display
5,Good 5G phone
5,"Bought it on the first day of launch. Delivered the next day. Very fast delivery by Amazon. Have been using it for last two days.Pros1. Phone has glass at the back which gives it a premium look. Feels stylish to carry it along.2. As usual, Samsung screen is smooth. Good picture clarity.3. Adaptive brightness 8s one of the best I've come across till date.4. Phone is very light.5. Camera quality is also very good. Front camera is also decent.6. Battery life is more than 24hrs for regular browsing over 24*7 wifi connection.7. Fingerprint sensor on right side is handy.Cons1. Charger is only 15 Watt. 25/30 Watt would have been better.2. Nothing else as of now.I feel good holding and using this Phone. If there is any chance then I'll update the review."
1,"Speakers are very very weak, produce very low sound, you will need headphone or speakers to listen music, I purchased it on first day and now they are just offering replacement which will not solve the purpose as every samsung M32 5G phone has this problem so I would recommend others to not waste their hard earned money in this phone as cost is too high compared to quality"
1,"Phone look is nice,Battery drain 65% after normal use 4 hours and 15 min.Camera is not as 48 mp if I compare my vivo phone 13 Mp is better than thisIf I talk about all over performance so phone is only good looking else nothing is in this device is goodPlz don't waste your money"
1,"I sold the phone sameday somehow on olx in 4k loss. Amazon doesn‚Äôt provide return.Phone is a joke.Plain M32 had full hd screen and now with 5G price has gone up by 6k and display is surprisingly half hd(HD+) . This is plain loot.Plastic is cheap.Camera is worst than any 10k phnSlow processorEven screen lags in scrolling, such bad refresh ratePathetic Processor and ramOverall its from 2012 times where HD+ was a thing. This phone is 9 yrs late.Never buy samsung in this segment."
3,They really need to work like motorola
1,Dislike- camera
4,"Received what I ordered.Received on time which is good, Thanks Amazon Team.Good Quality mobile from Samsung.Cheapest 5g ever with 12 band support.Purchased for my wife she is happy with phone.This worth and value for money üí∞ I would say.Sky Blue üîµ color looks premium!"
1,"After using one month I am writing this review,1. Galaxy M30s is better when compared to M32 5G, M30s has good battery capacity and camera quality,2. The camera quality is poor and the pixels.3. In this phone we can expect only 5G option that too we have to check after upgrading the sim.4. Regarding softwares I will post after updating the new software installation from Samsung,"
2,Over heat is produced while charging and when wattsapp messages receive and downloading. Spoke to customer care executive but they are not ready to take return
5,"Smooth touch, future ready with 5g, sleek design, expandable memory option upto 1 tb.First impression of the phone is good,when used phone continuously for over 2 hrs, videos and downloads and battery went from 50% to 25%, so i expect it to run for a day with full charge. Fast charge is also excellent, but not like other fast charges available in market. Its 1 min for 1% approxThere has been a issue with the M series of phones with UI not responding and system hangs, but this processor on m32 seems to be strong and they have I reckon resolved the issue (recommended not to use Samsung in build apps much as they consume lot of data and there is unnecessary lots of cashed data stored).Camera is OK, but they have lot of features like macro cam for close up night mode and have snap chat filters pre-added on camera which makes it fun and handy.Overall a perfect buy at this price range."
4,"Cons:1. Charger Adapter is only 15W Fast Charging unit. It takes  nearly 2 hours to get fully charged2. Charger wire length is less than 2 feet (comparatively less to the normal length of Charger wire )3. Fully charged phone will stand only 1 day if we use the phone at full level (use internet + calls ) through out the day.Pros:1. We can use secure folder option for securing confidential info/apps and data when we hand over the phone to some body either using finger print or pin or a pattern which is different from phone pattern.2. I got phone with RAM of 6 GB and installed several apps and used , phone doesn't show any slow down in speed.3. Finger print sensor at side switch on/off button seems to be attractive."
1,"Good phone till now except the finger print button location which accidentally pressed always when we are holding the phoneUpdate: reducing a starFacing glitches, not able to hear when I call to some body at first, if I keep try 2nd or 3rd time, then only I can hear.If it connect first then voice is not clear. Never faced any of these in my earlier realme phCharging time taking hell lot of time.Update: pls don't this phone, it's speaker is not clear, when I call its giving some disturbance not able hear the voice clearly"
1,"It's a worst mobile phone ever, Samsung proof that they are loos their credibility in India. This phone can not be worth more than  8k to 10 k. Camera is very poor, You can only use single Sim if you are using Micro SD card, Display is very poor , plz don't buy this phone. I think Samsung is going footprint of NOKIA ."
1,"The quality of camera, screen and performance or not at all good.camera quality is very very poor not even capturing photo like a phone of cost 3k. And the return policy of amazon was worst. Not a proper response by the executives of amazon. They are not accepting the return of this product, don't know the reason behind this. Dont  Why they are enecouranging sale of this product,  when they are getting similar problem form multiple customers.  Belief on amazon have worsening day by day.. literally disopinted with the amazon."
2,I personally  felt  display and front cam  ok ok but atleast rear cam for 23k 48mp its not good quality also. I am preferred to buy Samsung  but not this model
1,Don‚Äôt buy this product .Image quality is below average comparing with the specification. Useless camera.And there is NO RETURN POLICY and replacing with same mobile is big headache .DON‚ÄôT buy this mobile
4,"Let‚Äôs make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve ‚Äî the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in ‚Äî the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricingüá©¬†üá™¬†üá∏¬†üáÆ¬†üá¨¬†üá≥¬†Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I‚Äôd still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What‚Äôs more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn‚Äôt strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.üá©¬†üáÆ¬†üá∏¬†üáµ¬†üá±¬†üá¶¬†üáæ¬†The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it‚Äôs large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it‚Äôs an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it‚Äôs just not bright enough.üÖ±üÖ∞üÜÉüÜÉüÖ¥üÜÅüÜàThe battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow ‚Äî the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?üÖ≤üÖ∞üÖºüÖ¥üÜÅüÖ∞There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There‚Äôs an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps."
5,Awesome
1,"Very bad experience from Amazon. Very bad camera quality of the phone. I want to return the phone, but amazon is not taking back the phone. I don't want to purchase any product from amazon further. Leaving amazon app permanently"
5,Best buy at this price! The display quality is amazing and I do not have any complaint with the camera too. There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.
4,i didn't upload photo ....for any reason but it is not up to the mark .1.display 4/52.cam 3/53.fing sens.. 4.5/54.processor 3/55.build quality 3.75/5back panel is not good looking coz some self design as per my opinionin this price segment rs 9000 is good enough
1,This phone is not value for moneyIts a downgraded phone of earlier phone launched in india.The camera is worst i ever seen in any redmi phone.Battery is ok.The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.Dot notch display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera.Recently i am using redmi note 5 pro. And this phone is just downgraded phone by redmi .you cannot imagine low light photography in this phone.The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 prime.
5,Good product value for money but ordering is too difficult within one minute soldout
4,Product is best at this price but charging speed is very slow but we cannot accept more then this at this price
5,Good mobile
3,"Processor is bit slow, camera is below average except that everthing works fine. I personally don't like MIUI because of lots of ads and bloatwares. But, good budget range phone if you ignore/adjust this issues."

4,Overall its good and satisfied for the price.Pros:1. Good Battery.2. Best budget phone for 8999 with 4GB RAM and 64GB Internal Memory.The only drawback i felt is Camera.If you are looking for a better camera I would suggest to pick some other model.
5,best good product prive battry camera all very good
5,GOOD
1,"It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile."

3,"Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware. Unauthorised data transfer to China.If possible go for Motorola E7 around the same price and you will have great experience with Snapdragon and clean android experience."
3,Charging Adapter came with phone turned out to be defective. stopped working after 2 weeks of purchase.Don't know how to return the adapter or how to claim the warranty on adapter alone.Phone is working fine so far and looks good
1,Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
4,If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
5,"Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."

AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
3,"COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"
1,"Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. üòû. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone üì±, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone.

3,Made in China product
5,"Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
3,Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
2,Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
5,It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
5,"Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best.

4,"Good mobile,in this corona times if we want quality product for basic regular usage,this Redmi 9a 3 gb /32 bestCamera is average like all entry-level mobiles,Redmi might send an update for small big fixes like every new mobile launch,gcam till now not available,with that quality of camera increasesDesign display very good,slim tall mobileBattery very good,takes 2.5 hours for full charge,so better charge when 40 % battery left.People who are planning to buy 4 gb /64 gb Redmi 9a,don't take it ,best to go for Redmi 9 as we get finger print scanner, slightly better speed,camera and build quality for just 700rs moreSpeed of Redmi 9a is good for 3- 4 appsCons:No gorilla glass protectionNo Secondary noise cancelling mic,this is big mistake by redmi as they give in every mobileNo Finger print scannerFinally under 10,000 rs all Redmi 9 series mobiles are very best as they provide 4 gb ram variant in very price segment,only option we have"
2,Phone is good. But it is made in China
5,Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
1,"I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available. You can replace only. So, please don't buy this worst product. Even for first time im facing that amazon support also not supporting in this issue. I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."
3,"Purchased the 3gb variant of redmi 9a. Following is the review based on 1day of usageProsDisplay and battery backupOuter designLatest Android 10 based miui 12Back cover looks sturdy (less chances of falling off your hand)ConsPolycarbonate back cover vibrates when phone is on full volumeNo fast charging, takes 2 hr 45 minutes to fully chargeNo notification light (a big bummer)No Gorilla glass protectionNo fingerprint sensor however face unlock works fineVerdictA decent entry level phone however no need to exchange if u r using redmi 8a. If you can squeeze in a few more bucks, then there are many good phone for 9k."
4,"So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5‚≠ê for thatPros-‚Ä¢Low price, wont get any other phones in this range‚Ä¢ Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.‚Ä¢Good for basic usage.‚Ä¢Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:‚Ä¢camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)‚Ä¢Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use‚≠ê"
3,A little bit slow..I think it will more lagged afterwards..Big screen.Camera is not good.. As well as selfie..Ph is For normal users..
5,Best phone you can get at this segment totally worth the amount you are paying
2,Worst camera ever...both front & back... & Screen resolution is not good.
1,During visit Amazon's site mobile manufacturer details  Made in India but product received made in china!!!!!!!I purchased two mobile same model different date.First product made in IndiaSecond product made in china
1,Not satisfied. No camera perfection. No finger sensor. Perfect China piece. Cheap and worst. Started hanging.
1,It's.  Cheating screen size 6.53 but too much narro . You can use only about 5 inch . And company has not write Anny pllace about screenn width size.6.53 is cover is in. Lenth ..So polease do not buy if. You want a big sacree mobile
5,Lovely low budget mobile love u redmi nice look mobile
1,Received damaged product. really disappointed.
1,Backwash phone no good phone cheap pro. Mediatek 720 screen TFT and battery charger  slow 15 watt only like 10000 phone ..nothing good..samsung very poor phone ..don't buy in 20000 ...TFT like 5000 phone display
5,Good 5G phone
5,"Bought it on the first day of launch. Delivered the next day. Very fast delivery by Amazon. Have been using it for last two days.Pros1. Phone has glass at the back which gives it a premium look. Feels stylish to carry it along.2. As usual, Samsung screen is smooth. Good picture clarity.3. Adaptive brightness 8s one of the best I've come across till date.4. Phone is very light.5. Camera quality is also very good. Front camera is also decent.6. Battery life is more than 24hrs for regular browsing over 24*7 wifi connection.7. Fingerprint sensor on right side is handy.Cons1. Charger is only 15 Watt. 25/30 Watt would have been better.2. Nothing else as of now.I feel good holding and using this Phone. If there is any chance then I'll update the review."
1,"Speakers are very very weak, produce very low sound, you will need headphone or speakers to listen music, I purchased it on first day and now they are just offering replacement which will not solve the purpose as every samsung M32 5G phone has this problem so I would recommend others to not waste their hard earned money in this phone as cost is too high compared to quality"
1,"Phone look is nice,Battery drain 65% after normal use 4 hours and 15 min.Camera is not as 48 mp if I compare my vivo phone 13 Mp is better than thisIf I talk about all over performance so phone is only good looking else nothing is in this device is goodPlz don't waste your money"
1,"I sold the phone sameday somehow on olx in 4k loss. Amazon doesn‚Äôt provide return.Phone is a joke.Plain M32 had full hd screen and now with 5G price has gone up by 6k and display is surprisingly half hd(HD+) . This is plain loot.Plastic is cheap.Camera is worst than any 10k phnSlow processorEven screen lags in scrolling, such bad refresh ratePathetic Processor and ramOverall its from 2012 times where HD+ was a thing. This phone is 9 yrs late.Never buy samsung in this segment."
3,They really need to work like motorola
1,Dislike- camera
4,"Received what I ordered.Received on time which is good, Thanks Amazon Team.Good Quality mobile from Samsung.Cheapest 5g ever with 12 band support.Purchased for my wife she is happy with phone.This worth and value for money üí∞ I would say.Sky Blue üîµ color looks premium!"
1,"After using one month I am writing this review,1. Galaxy M30s is better when compared to M32 5G, M30s has good battery capacity and camera quality,2. The camera quality is poor and the pixels.3. In this phone we can expect only 5G option that too we have to check after upgrading the sim.4. Regarding softwares I will post after updating the new software installation from Samsung,"
2,Over heat is produced while charging and when wattsapp messages receive and downloading. Spoke to customer care executive but they are not ready to take return
5,"Smooth touch, future ready with 5g, sleek design, expandable memory option upto 1 tb.First impression of the phone is good,when used phone continuously for over 2 hrs, videos and downloads and battery went from 50% to 25%, so i expect it to run for a day with full charge. Fast charge is also excellent, but not like other fast charges available in market. Its 1 min for 1% approxThere has been a issue with the M series of phones with UI not responding and system hangs, but this processor on m32 seems to be strong and they have I reckon resolved the issue (recommended not to use Samsung in build apps much as they consume lot of data and there is unnecessary lots of cashed data stored).Camera is OK, but they have lot of features like macro cam for close up night mode and have snap chat filters pre-added on camera which makes it fun and handy.Overall a perfect buy at this price range."
4,"Cons:1. Charger Adapter is only 15W Fast Charging unit. It takes  nearly 2 hours to get fully charged2. Charger wire length is less than 2 feet (comparatively less to the normal length of Charger wire )3. Fully charged phone will stand only 1 day if we use the phone at full level (use internet + calls ) through out the day.Pros:1. We can use secure folder option for securing confidential info/apps and data when we hand over the phone to some body either using finger print or pin or a pattern which is different from phone pattern.2. I got phone with RAM of 6 GB and installed several apps and used , phone doesn't show any slow down in speed.3. Finger print sensor at side switch on/off button seems to be attractive."
1,"Good phone till now except the finger print button location which accidentally pressed always when we are holding the phoneUpdate: reducing a starFacing glitches, not able to hear when I call to some body at first, if I keep try 2nd or 3rd time, then only I can hear.If it connect first then voice is not clear. Never faced any of these in my earlier realme phCharging time taking hell lot of time.Update: pls don't this phone, it's speaker is not clear, when I call its giving some disturbance not able hear the voice clearly"
1,"It's a worst mobile phone ever, Samsung proof that they are loos their credibility in India. This phone can not be worth more than  8k to 10 k. Camera is very poor, You can only use single Sim if you are using Micro SD card, Display is very poor , plz don't buy this phone. I think Samsung is going footprint of NOKIA ."
1,"The quality of camera, screen and performance or not at all good.camera quality is very very poor not even capturing photo like a phone of cost 3k. And the return policy of amazon was worst. Not a proper response by the executives of amazon. They are not accepting the return of this product, don't know the reason behind this. Dont  Why they are enecouranging sale of this product,  when they are getting similar problem form multiple customers.  Belief on amazon have worsening day by day.. literally disopinted with the amazon."
2,I personally  felt  display and front cam  ok ok but atleast rear cam for 23k 48mp its not good quality also. I am preferred to buy Samsung  but not this model
1,Very disappointed with the overall performance from Samsung
4,"Got the mobile on the launch date,Battery must be appreciatedCamera is just averageMobile performance is above average90hz refresh rate? If u r buying the mobile for this feature then I'm afraid u may get disappointed, it's just normal.The USB cable is too small in lengthIt's a good mobile in this budget, there are no returns for this,  only replacement is available, hence choose wisely before buying"
3,Camera quality is low
1,"1. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.2. Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one.3. Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.4. No return policy, you will have to live with the phone you didn't like. Now you decide."
1,"Not worth buying....faulty software, poor display quality, single band wifi doesn't support  5ghz WIFI band. Gyro sensor missing and many more. DONT GO BY PAID REVIEWS IN YOU TUBE"
5,"In this budget, it has exceeded all expectations .. I have primarily taken this phone for the battery and so far not disappointed"
1,I will never purchase Samsung phones. Phone is lagging too much and slow. Waste of hard earning money.
1,This is worst samsung mobile I have seen from samsung. It's sceen quality and colors are trash. Even a old 5000 rs phone can beat it's quality. Please never ever buy this product.

1,The phone hangs a lot and is very slow. I received a replacement which continues to hang
1,Very poor quality camera .Found box seal damage still Amazon not taking it back.waste of money.Phone very slow.Don‚Äôt buy from Amazon.Now Amazon started cheating customers to make profits.
1,"Worst camera quality. It is like 2 megapixel camera. Photos are very worst. If you slightly zoom the photo,  you can see blurry...Previously I used 13 megapixel amera phone. Those photos are very good."
1,"No 5Ghz wifi band on this mobile, miserable in 2021 , even my previous mobile of Samsung which I bought in 2017 have 5Ghz wifi , it's a big comedy"
1,Don't received  handset ejection  pin  and manual.
5,Just unboxed the phone.Seems to be a better one in this price segment as of now.Just checked with the camera & voice it seems good but one thing it's very heavy in weight may be due to battery.Hope samsung lives upto expectation.
1,very poor build qualityvery poor camera piclow quality phoneno return policyvery worst mobilejust making fool to customer by samsung m12 and Amazon
1,Hitting issue
1,Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don't waste money on this product.
1,"Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price."
5,"This is perfect phone, good speed, decent specs and outstanding battery life. The look of the device is also attractive. Above all, the trust of company."
1,"PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
1,"Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don't buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI."
1,Dislike
2,"Product specifications are not at par..Display is below average.Camera quality is just okay..It doesnt support 5ghz wifi, which is not mentioned anywhere so please make sure before buying.."
1,Self camera is just like 2 mega pixels.
1,"The user experience is pathetic on these cheap phones. Its filled to the brim with bloatware that you can't remove.You're better off getting the Mi phones as they have a far better UIAlso, I can't return this garbage of a phone as Samsung don't list this as a software issue.I'll have to look into installing lineage os and de-google this phone before using it but that's easier said than done."
1,Just for name sake Cam & Battery are 48mp & 6000mah. But coming to reality it is poor. The weight of the phone also almost 250gm so it is not a smart phone it is a hard phone. And the top menu bar beside front cam is not responding sometimes.
5,"A very satisfying  experience with the device so  far.Pros:1. Long battery life-  I am a moderate  user who does everything  except gaming. That said , the battery lasts up to 2 full days.2. Decent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.3. Very responsive finger print sensor.4. Good sound quality, although dolby's impact  is not much pronounced5. UI is great and snappy. Lots of customization options.6. The display is good and smooth with 90hz refresh rate. It does make the difference.7. Fast charging works fine.Cons:1. The weight of the phone is on the heavier side @ 220 gms2. The display could have been a full HD+ @ 1080p3. No led notification light. All though there are apps that can do the job on an AMOLED screen.Overall, a good package."
1,Horrible product
1,"Not a good mobile.Quite heavy in weight, you will obviously feel it. Weight is 220 gms which is far exceeding acceptable range. Can definitely be used as paperweight.Nothing special in screen, processor or camera also.Just a marketing gimmick by samsung.Stay away.. At 13.5k we deserve far better than this."
3,Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn‚Äôt give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you‚Äôre choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you‚Äôll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review
4,I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1. Battery and Camera.1. BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non sense.I played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98% to 80 %2. Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this
1,Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp
1,"This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information."
5,"It's a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they're wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it üòå. Once again no complains regarding anything."
1,Look is average. Battery life is good. Only go ahead if you just need a good brand name otherwise 100 of options are available in market. You will definitely get disappointed with camera which is actually not more than 12 mega pixels.  This phone nothing but a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached. Samsung must call back these phones as it is definitely going to kill the brand name. I will highly appreciate if Amazon has the guts to publish this review. This is an open challenge to Amazon...
2,"The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box"
4,"Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage .  I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck .Awesome battery life , and that's what I want . I am just using it for basic social media and calls .. rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device .CAMERA is average , My ipad's 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called ""true"" 48MP.My advice-- go for 6gb variant as 2.5 gb is acquired by the system .Overall - 4‚òÜ"
1,"Disappointed with this mobile.... PhonePay & GooglePay apps are not working properly.... Numbers visible only half and getting overlapped....and we're end up typing wrong Pin numbers.... multiple times we have changed the Pin for these apps... now a days We regularly use mobile for online payments but this mobile is not useful for online payments due to app issues.We have tried to return this mobile, but Amazon return policy date was over by the time we found the issue."
5,I am using this phone for the last one week and i noticed few positive and negative things about it.Positive points -‚Ä¢ Fingerprint sensor is so fast and i loved it‚Ä¢ Battery backup (6000 mAh) is amazing even after using it throughout the day‚Ä¢ Camera quality is really good and the pictures are amazing on day light‚Ä¢ Large display having a size of 6.5 inches and can run games smoothly on low graphic settings‚Ä¢ 90Hz refresh rate feels so smooth‚Ä¢ The phone doesn't lag or get heated after using it for a long time because of Exynos 850 (8nm) high-end processorNegative points -‚Ä¢ Not made for hard-core gaming because the processor is not strong enough to run games smoothly on high graphics‚Ä¢ The weight of phone is heavy‚Ä¢ The brightness level is somewhat low as compared to other phones‚Ä¢ The display that you will get is around 720 x 1600 pixels‚Ä¢ The downloading as well as uploading speed is also low as compared to other phones within this price range‚Ä¢ It is not water resistant and does not have Gorilla glass for screen protection .~ I am satisfied with this phone because of it's camera quality and battery backup ‚àö

Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this
1,Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp
1,"This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information."
5,"It's a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they're wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it üòå. Once again no complains regarding anything."
1,Look is average. Battery life is good. Only go ahead if you just need a good brand name otherwise 100 of options are available in market. You will definitely get disappointed with camera which is actually not more than 12 mega pixels.  This phone nothing but a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached. Samsung must call back these phones as it is definitely going to kill the brand name. I will highly appreciate if Amazon has the guts to publish this review. This is an open challenge to Amazon...
2,"The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box"
4,"Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage .  I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck .Awesome battery life , and that's what I want . I am just using it for basic social media and calls .. rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device .CAMERA is average , My ipad's 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called ""true"" 48MP.My advice-- go for 6gb variant as 2.5 gb is acquired by the system .Overall - 4‚òÜ"
1,"Disappointed with this mobile.... PhonePay & GooglePay apps are not working properly.... Numbers visible only half and getting overlapped....and we're end up typing wrong Pin numbers.... multiple times we have changed the Pin for these apps... now a days We regularly use mobile for online payments but this mobile is not useful for online payments due to app issues.We have tried to return this mobile, but Amazon return policy date was over by the time we found the issue."
5,I am using this phone for the last one week and i noticed few positive and negative things about it.Positive points -‚Ä¢ Fingerprint sensor is so fast and i loved it‚Ä¢ Battery backup (6000 mAh) is amazing even after using it throughout the day‚Ä¢ Camera quality is really good and the pictures are amazing on day light‚Ä¢ Large display having a size of 6.5 inches and can run games smoothly on low graphic settings‚Ä¢ 90Hz refresh rate feels so smooth‚Ä¢ The phone doesn't lag or get heated after using it for a long time because of Exynos 850 (8nm) high-end processorNegative points -‚Ä¢ Not made for hard-core gaming because the processor is not strong enough to run games smoothly on high graphics‚Ä¢ The weight of phone is heavy‚Ä¢ The brightness level is somewhat low as compared to other phones‚Ä¢ The display that you will get is around 720 x 1600 pixels‚Ä¢ The downloading as well as uploading speed is also low as compared to other phones within this price range‚Ä¢ It is not water resistant and does not have Gorilla glass for screen protection .~ I am satisfied with this phone because of it's camera quality and battery backup ‚àö
1,Very disappointed with the overall performance from Samsung
4,"Got the mobile on the launch date,Battery must be appreciatedCamera is just averageMobile performance is above average90hz refresh rate? If u r buying the mobile for this feature then I'm afraid u may get disappointed, it's just normal.The USB cable is too small in lengthIt's a good mobile in this budget, there are no returns for this,  only replacement is available, hence choose wisely before buying"
3,Camera quality is low
1,"1. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.2. Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one.3. Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.4. No return policy, you will have to live with the phone you didn't like. Now you decide."
1,"Not worth buying....faulty software, poor display quality, single band wifi doesn't support  5ghz WIFI band. Gyro sensor missing and many more. DONT GO BY PAID REVIEWS IN YOU TUBE"
5,"In this budget, it has exceeded all expectations .. I have primarily taken this phone for the battery and so far not disappointed"
1,I will never purchase Samsung phones. Phone is lagging too much and slow. Waste of hard earning money.
1,This is worst samsung mobile I have seen from samsung. It's sceen quality and colors are trash. Even a old 5000 rs phone can beat it's quality. Please never ever buy this product.

1,The phone hangs a lot and is very slow. I received a replacement which continues to hang
1,Very poor quality camera .Found box seal damage still Amazon not taking it back.waste of money.Phone very slow.Don‚Äôt buy from Amazon.Now Amazon started cheating customers to make profits.
1,"Worst camera quality. It is like 2 megapixel camera. Photos are very worst. If you slightly zoom the photo,  you can see blurry...Previously I used 13 megapixel amera phone. Those photos are very good."
1,"No 5Ghz wifi band on this mobile, miserable in 2021 , even my previous mobile of Samsung which I bought in 2017 have 5Ghz wifi , it's a big comedy"
1,Don't received  handset ejection  pin  and manual.
5,Just unboxed the phone.Seems to be a better one in this price segment as of now.Just checked with the camera & voice it seems good but one thing it's very heavy in weight may be due to battery.Hope samsung lives upto expectation.
1,very poor build qualityvery poor camera piclow quality phoneno return policyvery worst mobilejust making fool to customer by samsung m12 and Amazon
1,Hitting issue
1,Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don't waste money on this product.
1,"Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price."
5,"This is perfect phone, good speed, decent specs and outstanding battery life. The look of the device is also attractive. Above all, the trust of company."
1,"PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
1,"Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don't buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI."
1,Dislike
2,"Product specifications are not at par..Display is below average.Camera quality is just okay..It doesnt support 5ghz wifi, which is not mentioned anywhere so please make sure before buying.."
1,Self camera is just like 2 mega pixels.
1,"The user experience is pathetic on these cheap phones. Its filled to the brim with bloatware that you can't remove.You're better off getting the Mi phones as they have a far better UIAlso, I can't return this garbage of a phone as Samsung don't list this as a software issue.I'll have to look into installing lineage os and de-google this phone before using it but that's easier said than done."
1,Just for name sake Cam & Battery are 48mp & 6000mah. But coming to reality it is poor. The weight of the phone also almost 250gm so it is not a smart phone it is a hard phone. And the top menu bar beside front cam is not responding sometimes.
5,"A very satisfying  experience with the device so  far.Pros:1. Long battery life-  I am a moderate  user who does everything  except gaming. That said , the battery lasts up to 2 full days.2. Decent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.3. Very responsive finger print sensor.4. Good sound quality, although dolby's impact  is not much pronounced5. UI is great and snappy. Lots of customization options.6. The display is good and smooth with 90hz refresh rate. It does make the difference.7. Fast charging works fine.Cons:1. The weight of the phone is on the heavier side @ 220 gms2. The display could have been a full HD+ @ 1080p3. No led notification light. All though there are apps that can do the job on an AMOLED screen.Overall, a good package."
1,Horrible product
1,"Not a good mobile.Quite heavy in weight, you will obviously feel it. Weight is 220 gms which is far exceeding acceptable range. Can definitely be used as paperweight.Nothing special in screen, processor or camera also.Just a marketing gimmick by samsung.Stay away.. At 13.5k we deserve far better than this."
3,Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn‚Äôt give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you‚Äôre choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you‚Äôll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review

1,"Please don't buy this mobile. Waste of money. I buy this mobile before 20 days only. Now not working properly. Hanging problem, handset very slow. Please don't buy it"
5,Nice
1,There is no headphone in the box... unsatisfied üòü disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è
5,It's worth for 9.5k. after exchange offer.light weight n thin.easy to use.mobile have fingerprint n facial recognition to unlock and lifespan of battery lasts long.ram n rom are good.worth buying it.camera quality is ok.
2,"It's an average phone. Quite on the pretty side. ONLY those who are looking for a budget phone can think of purchasing this one. The camera is very average, but the functions & controls of the phone are smooth. It's very lightweight - that's a plus!"
5,Its a really very amazing and a nicely working phone..the camera quality and battery is also very goodü§©üòä.liked the product very much
1,Worst mobile . I never expect from oppo such a low grade mobile. Touch is not working. Phone hanging. No return and replacement option.  From Amazon I got bad experience. Don't buy this mobile. Waste of money.
1,It is roadside product with dusty display. When called Amazon customer care she deny to replace item. Don't buy anything from Amazon. Amazon only sells defective items. I returned many items and this was very useless response. She also disconnected call.USELESS AMAZON
1,"when i ordered this phone , headphone is free with phone but received order without headphone"
4,Nice phone value for money but in inbox there is no earphone and screen protector receive being a regular customer of Amazon i am  unhappy there was  clearly written that these items are included in inbox.
1,"Body sensor not working. Was late by 2 days to find out this defect and so could not use ""return"" option.Due to body sensor problem, phone display never gets off while talking and so when brought close to ear, buttons like mute, hold gets activated while speaking.The basic function, which is to talk to others on phone becomes troublesome. Everytime have to very careful of holding position to make sure phone is not touched on body. Hate this and feel cheated/dejected.Cannot return as well."
5,"Nice mobile prices 12,450"
3,i have recently bought this phone..on 18 may 2020.. delivery is good but there was no headphones in a box.features r awesome nd phone is working gud.but camera quality is bit bad.
1,This mobile was used by someone else.I have got someone else's mobile.I am not happy for this mobile.I will not do return this mobile.Because the reason of I give gift for other person.
5,"Oppo always exports premium quality mobiles. Let there be no such features like other mobile but i phone also doesn't export such features at high price, then?I have attached some pictures also you can check them incase you wanna see the picture quality.Hence you can buy this without any tension.Amazing mobile's camera and body quality and display is also good.Go for it I suggest. üòÉ"
1,This product received wrost.. In this item some useful applications not run..Order canceled but no cancelation status and pick up status updating by Amazon..No any contact provided by Amazon..Realy disappoint..
4,"Better to value for money , quality is as per shown ..And fast delivered by amazon."
1,Don't buy it from Amazon the return service of Amazon is very bad..disgusting they never think customer problem no one in call centre never call you return policy and service is very poor only benefit looking cite ... don't buy anything from amazon.. in future I never buy electronics items from Amazon... flipcart is most trusted than amazon
1,Earphones not received in a phone box
1,The phone lags a lot right from the box. You have to swipe 3-4 times. Apps get hung. Never seen such a pathetic phone.
2,This product details said there is a earphone and screen protector.  But i didnt get that
5,The phone is excellent but if the front and rear camara should be high and should be their dark mode compalsary but it should be added fastly and should give ear phonesonly main default is not nice camara should be high because the less cost mobiles will take more tean agers so they do moor selfies so it should increase and oppo is the selfie expert but this phone no selfie expert camara for next phone it should increase .Imay think I will increase
1,"1. Phone don't have type C charging2. Dual app not possible for all app like redmi phones3. Charger is normal 5v 2 Amp so no fast charging.4. Not for multi tasking people.5. Camera and sound average6. Processor and touch very slow7. Only 6GB RAM AND 128 GB ROM is good  in this phone.8. Also it's not showing dual 4G9. Battery is only 1 day at normal uses.10. Display dpi is also very low.11. Can be treated as entry level phone.12. WhatsApp Camera function is abnormal, don't waste money on OPPO A31"
3,"I like the product. But as compared to my other phone Realme X2. I found the lag in processing in some of minor things also. It is having 6GB RAM then also the having some processing issue. I don;t like the product. Even after this specs, the things are getting lag."
1,"Screen quality is very poor , camera is also nearly poor, all over the phone is worst. I ordered this phone by choosing the no cost emi option of Bajaj , but they are also taking the processing charges of Rs.174 on every instalment.So please don‚Äôt use Bajaj‚Äôs emi option for ordering this phone. Thanks"
1,"i have received the waste and damaged products and i chasing the customer support from last 10 days no solution upto now waste of money on  amazon ,waste of time on amazon ,and i customer of amzaon from last 5 years and i am a prime member this is the services i am getting"
3,Updating after 4month :-screen recorder not available..which is default function of every android now a days..-Charging draining faster but charging gaining very slower.-its not a 21st century phone .. so many basic features missing Day 1: experience:-Most important : it will not redirect the link into the present app in mobile .... It will open link every times in default browser..Eg: if I got any Facebook /insta /Twitter link and I already have installed these app then it will not asking me to get open with app instead it will redirect to browser and again I need to login... So so poor technology1.processor looks slow while setup and configuration my account data restoration as compare to redmi note 7 (same price older version phone than this)2. Camera quality is very low both back and front ...capture blurred images..not focusing the face even after setup manually.3.  Not value for money.. I think I made mistake to choose oppo brand .. I compare all the feature with redmi.. redmi looks far better than this..4. No front flash light available to click in night5. Looks slow to handle multiple apps compare to redmi6. Please don't buy this phone..this is so poor technology phone..
3,Headsets are missing in the phone box...where are the original headsets...its normally included in phonebox??
4,Nice mobile in this Price üëåüëåüëåüëå..
4,Nice product...but there is no C pin charger  thts only one prob in this product...
4,"Good product  but as compared to Mi note 8 its not Good . If you want to rought use for bussiness purchase.. Provessor is slow , not for gaming. But want you tube and surffing it's usefull. Another all thing is good .I don't have time for upload pics , but this review is enought.Product is same as photos."
5,Very nice phone for Rs.12500/-
3,"For your low budget, simple mobile but i recommend you to invest 2k or 3k more and buy a better mobile."
5,Overall nice phone for people who need a basic smartphone experience.Use nova launcher for better UI. Default launcher is not that much good.I'm happy with the purchase..!!!
5,Very satisfactory with the features under 7K and happy with the quick delivery in lockdown time ny amazon.budget friendly phone.
2,There  is a bulge in white cover area and back cover shaped like a lump got opened when trying to use mobile. Also volume buttons and power on off button did not function. I am it as a manufacturer defect. Please consider replacement.
1,"I had purchased this phone for my dad , and as he is not that tech guy so i thought not to purchase a high range phone instead of that to buy a simple economic smartphone, however once my dad received the product , He was not happy at all and he mentioned to me that he feels that this phone is to complicated for him and so his old phone is much better, so it's a terrible feeling as when gift someone something and he/,she doesn't like it then it's simply a wastage of money"
5,"Pros-Price, stock android, battery backup, fluid ui, no 3rd part app, easy to use, android pie9, more space on rom, small form factor for a 5.5inch display device,made in india, non-chines phone, runs smoothly.Cons-Display quality is ok ok but could be a bit better, processor runs smoothly but could be a bit better, loud speaker sound is ok ok but not so sweet.Overall in my opinion the phone is value for money. It is very useful for elder persons who don't have much knowledge about technology. It is also small sized fits in hand and can be operated by one hand easily. It also give protective transparent back cover and screen protective film with it."
3,Price of Rs 6500 is not justified. Display is very poor. Only Stock android apps. No dedicated apps for music or file manager etc. But you can use google play music and google files for that.Phone is narrower than redmi phones in similar price bracket.The only reason I bought this phone is the unavailability of other well known brands on Amazon in this price range. Jusk ok phone.
1,"Panasonic Eluga I6 is a very bad phone. It was purchased in June 2020 and had stopped working in only 3 months time. Service Centres in a big city like Kolkata are on the fringes, 20-30 kms. away from city centre. Very Bad experience with this phone. My recommendation - Do not buy."
4,Not a phone for high end users....the best thing about this phone is that it will offer you all the necessary features of a smartphone without the bloatware crap...Camera is pretty basic....and needs good lighting....do not install lots of apps....will slow down ram...sound quality is good...quite strong also...will survive 1-2ft fall easily..battery lasts over 13-14 hrs after full charge....for this price it a very good phone...
5,Best phone in the budget specially for the online classes and it also has dual 4g there is a screen guard already installed in the phone and the battery stand by is just amazing if the charging is 100 in night the battery is 99 or 98% in morning it's amazing and we can play games to but not pubg it also comes with a back cover and a earphones the phone is the best in this range of price
2,"Got screen protector headset,back coverBut the performance of the phone is not good enoughReally slow,for a company like Panasonic it's a shame"
5,"Considering the price, this Indian smartphone is a good buy. The quality is good, got a pretty decent speed and screen size. In this price, this is definitely worth the buy. I bought this for someone in my family who needed a basic smartphone and it does fulfill all the conditions with it's features and performance."
1,This mobile have many problem s & seems to be total waste of money. Received on 10th Jun & after 10 days auto rotate not working. Today automatically switched off and not working. really fed up with the quality.Need complete replacement for the same.
1,"Both the mobile  is having  problems  like camera,  speak  call and video  call voice  is not clearly  heard  , so pls let  me know  how to complain  now"
1,It's too thick and heavy weight. Phone was getting hanged on the very first day of use. Worst battery backup. Totally disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è. Wouldn't suggest you to go for it.on charging it started heating up. Touch was not working properly.
4,"This product is very wonderful for the people who want a basic smartphone with most of the features. It can be used for taking very nice selfies in dim light. However, its rear camera gives out photos which are very bright, but it is satisfactory. It has a very good receiver speaker. It also gets charged just in 100 to 130 minutes. Just one thing is not good that the adapter gets heated quickly. If we compare this smartphone with non- Chinese smartphones, then I advice you to buy this smartphone."
1,"Very bad,Mic doesn't work in what's video call.Returned 1st order and placed 2nd order, same problem"
2,Arrived today and checked volume too low
4,"As usual Amazon deliverd late.Don't know if a prime member get a product so lately,what happens to non Prime membersPhoneRemembering the price the phone's display is ok,but brightness is low.speaker is good.you have to download high bit rate songs.easy in hands.3000 mah battery runs for a day.this phone is meant for old.so they are not heavy user to be kept in mind.cameravis really bad.8mp camera works like vga. Front camera is not usable.overall only for normal use.some fb,wa,vcall. Thats it."
1,"Bought on 9th Jun 2020... It stopped working on 28th Aug 2020Phone is extremely slow and gets heated up...since return window has closed, now I need to get it repaired at service centre and I have discarded the bill already."
1,Mic of the phone stopped working within a month. Now can talk to anyone only through speaker. Very poor phone by Panasonic. Won't suggest anyone to buy it.Panasonic should stop making phones if they are not good at it.
4,"For 6500 rs it's OK, an average phone.Not able to turn off camera shutter sound.Battery is average."
1,The performance of this phone is very poor. It hangs everytime when you install something from play store. The batter drowning very fast.I suggest every person who's saw this review please don't buy this phone because if u do then you can't get back your money.
5,Good product .Design should be changes such a way that loading of memory or sim should be easy process .Imran separate try's are required which can be ejected by pricking with pin .
1,"Worst product, after 7 months,showing as IMEI Number not working, barcode invalied, repaired but showing same error. Don't buy and  exchange is also not available. I was lost my money."
1,"We purchased new Panasonic Eluga 16, we found that while charging mobile getting very high heat & gettinghanging very offensively, we hv requested Amazon to replace another brand, one of the service person calledand assured to come and take, but not turned, while calling he is not picking up call and sending SMS thatyou may complaint Amazon, this is really ridiculous."
1,Unable to touch screen properly.worst battery .when we make full charge within 10 minutes it will get down by 0% and get switch off.showing storage full nothing we download.
1,Would be greedy to expect too much from a phone at this budget...but this phone is in direct competition with a snail....everything with this phone is a chore
5,Worthy... User free... Great Amazone & Panasonic.. Purchased two times for me and wife. Thanks
1,"This device stops working after a few days of operation ... Mobile screes completely blank now.. not getting powered on ... Please advise..how to get a warranty replacement. We did not anticipate such poor quality products will be supplied, which did not work for 30days .. Need your immediate action."
1,"This phone is not working properly,  getting stuck, touch screen hardly working and speaker not working..  I want to return this and purchase other one.  Please help return this and take another company phone"
4,Value for money. Camera was not upto Mark. Sound quality not good . Not loud. For video calling you have to put head phone. Otherwise sound would not reach other side. Otherwise phone is very good
1,It is a very slow phone especially for internet and apps like YouTube and WhatsApp. It‚Äôs Chinese rivals are ten times faster and better in performance. Unfortunately the phone does not live up to the Japanese iconic brand - Panasonic.
1,Phone went to Reboot Factory setting own it own and Charger stopped working with in 15 Day of Purchase.Very low level service centers and take a long time for replacement of charger. What is the use of a phone without a charger.Very Sad.
3,Not good.Not worth for that cost. Photos and videos are not clear. I have given gift to other friends. I enquired they informed me  why you have prefered this company mobile they are questioning me. I am not able to answer to them. Better go for other good company to choose. Thanq
3,Product is good based on price. But one defect is unable to hear clear voice on video call. Remaining all ok
1,V.bad.. main part is sim slot.. it's not working.. how intelligently ur cheating people... Pls don't do like this...
1,Worst product it looks like a very old model and worst display
1,Worst phone ever. I strongly disagree to buy such scrap phone. Overheating issue and hamgs a lot. Even WhatsApp isn't working properly.. Plz don't spend your money on such cheap brand and cheap phone.
1,The phone couldn't detect IMEI number of the phone... Handed over to Panasonic service centre at Ranchi but they have also failed.. they are sending the phone to Delhi...very unfortunate.. don't know it is the wrong at vendor side or manufaturer.. but we are not able to use the product...
1,Dont buy this it is not worth for money. It is working slow
5,Pros:-1. Display (Best display you can get at this price i.e.  Super Amoled with 90Hz Refresh Rate2. üîã Battery (6000 mAh big battery)3. Camera ( 64 mp) and selfie (20 mp) and if you  know you know samsung image processing  software.4. Looks and back Design ( Awesome Pattern with  rainbow üåà reflection.)5. Compact Size (6.4inches) not too big and not  too small.......handy..Cons:-1. Processor (mediatek helio g80) which is a low  end processor and it might not affect your  overall performance if you are not a heavy  gamer or something like that.2. Infinity U display. Nowadays drop notch display  is kinda outdated look since overall look of the  phone is great but this small thing is like a black  spot on a white chart paper.##But Also keep that in Mind how can you get  everything in just 14999 -17999 ........in mid  range...these specs are perfect and at last you  can trust the brand name too.üòè
4,Cons:1.Good phone at this price.2.Display Quality is really great. Looks premium3.Camera is also very nice in daylight. In indoor it takes some shacky images.4. For Normal use I think it is best phone considering Samsung √Ämoled display and security.CONS:1. Could have been better if it comes with strong processor2. Samsung should have provided a Back case3. This phones support 25w charger but only 15w charger is provided so there must be 25w charger in the box
4,"I am sure there will be many reviewers who will do an in-depth analysis and list out the pros and cons of the device. So here i am pointing out the negatives that i felt . First thing first, the ring volume is mediocre. Ring is not at all loud and i wondee whether I have recieved a faulty device.Second thing i loathe is that, the back cover is a fingerprint magnet. Some kind of resin or composite material is used.To be honest, i didn't like the phone much. The design is outdated and sub par a 10k phone. Since bought this for an elderly person, the ring volume was a total bummer for me. Thats it, another useless review from me."
1,"I purchased this phone on 16999 from Amazon by exchange .but I did not find any quality as per this high price.1. Phone touchscreen is very slow and sometimes hangs stop working.2 while viewing YouTube the voice is not coming clear sometimes voice going up and down ,  microphone and speaker of this phone is not up to the mark even I should say worst. Of its kind.3 this phone is marketed as 6 gb ram but most of the phone memory is already approx 3 gb is occupied by pre-installed app which you can not remove. This is complete cheating with customer regarding storage.4.in whatsapp I am unable to select the more  photos. Its processor is very slow.even slower than  my previous phone .Do not waste the money on the premium phone like these.Better go for any other company"
1,"This phone is not different then other Samsung phone.  Yeh log but be cheater hai , kuch bhi change nhi . 31 ka 32 fir krenge 33 . Battery utni bilkul nhi jitna Shor mcha rhe hai.

1,"Big major charging issue, charging icon is seen during charging but charging is not increased, that's a very bad or not exceptable by samsungConclusion- company target is money making not making a quality device üò°Now my money is loss and we are crying üò≠üíîüò¢"
1,"Believe me, it's the slowest mobile I saw. Don't go on screen and Battery, it is an extremely slow mobile phone and takes ages to open and navigate. Forget about heavy use, it can't handle normal regular use. I made a huge mistake but pls don't buy this mobile. It's only a few months and I am thinking to change it. Its dam SLOW SLOW SLOW."
1,"So greatful to Amazon for sending me such a nice product which has already landed in samsung service centre twice within one month of purchase, it was possible only when amazon refused to take back the product within the return period even though they've so called 'no questions asked' return policy.Above all Samsung did a great jod too by keeping the phone with themselves for 10 days now, sometimes I forget that I just bought a new phone because either it's not with me most of the times or it is sick.Lastly Amazon didn't even bother to reply back to my grievances.Hats off to you guys."
1,Samsung  is forcing the user to install all the junk applications  in our phone.even the Ota update installing the junks.Performce of the phone is pretty decent.Camera is also giving the good shots but the junk app spoiling the party.More than a samsung phone you are purchasing  bundle of junk applications
1,Worst camera. Seems like camera of local phone.  Returning this back.Too heavy. Don‚Äôt know why they are considering that 64 mp. Poor camera quality.
1,1. Heavy heat on both the sides. Front and back also.2. Charging is very slow.
1,Terrible phone. Always hang and unusable. Returning the product. Don't but this
5,"Processer is good.Both side Camera performance is good.Camera functions is work properly.In Screen look use face sacaner than fingerprint.Provide pre-installed apps Samsung system,  Microsoft system, Google system and Netflix's ,Amazon, etc.Charging capacity is too low, take 1¬Ω hr to charge.Fingerprint sacaner too small, many times its doesn't match.Lots of app pre-installed.25GB memory used out of 128."
3,"I'm a just a basic user of phones.  No movies, no games.  I mainly use phone, messages, photos, chats and other social apps and some utilities.  For the price, the features seem impressive and for my mild usage this phone sounds great.What I did not like is the amount of apps that were already installed on the phone!  Then I had to un-select a whole bunch of ""recommended"" apps during setup.  I was pre-subscribed to 'diagnostics' and 'recommendation' and 'marketing' notification by default!  Is that allowed?  Some features don't work unless I use specific apps.  Basically, they are app features and not phone features.  Sounds 'grey-area' to me.After spending half a day to go through all the settings and clean up the mess I think I'm ready to use this phone.  I still wonder what else I missed..."
1,Don't buy this mob... Camera performance is worse than 8k mob... Battery backup gives 1days.. On 60ghz..... 15k wasted.. No nfc...  Lost trust on Samsung.
5,My review after a week of usagepros-------*Battery - lasting for 2 days*Display - Great AMOLED display*Separate slot for memory card*Camera is also goodcons-------*Sometime touch is not working.*Battery - taking 3 hours to get fully charged. Nowadays we can get phone charged within 2 hours*Notification light is missing. Every time we need to on the button to check whether we have received any calls or messages*It is said that 15w charger but in adapter it says 10w (5.0 V = 2.0 A)*Too much of unwanted apps are pre-installed*Very outdated processor.
1,I am fully disappointed with this model.perfomance wise not good . Operating app is also slow taking so much time to open and download app .aslo taking so much time to charge after 40 % any mobile take 45 to 60 min to full charge but this mobile take around 90 to 120 min to charge.not worth it .not recommended to any one .
1,Battery Life is very poor .Even though it is 6000 mah battery it doesn't last a full day and needs to be charged atleast twice a dayEven though it is less than one month it's UI constantly stops and have to be closed.The response is extremely poor .I have been using One Plus 5 for the past 2 and half years and its response is better than this new device which is hanging and apps are crashing time and again .I had preferred an Indian phone to Chinese one but have been extremely disappointed with the performance of this phone
2,"I don't suggest to buy this m32 mobile, there is no extra features as they mentioned in their options, there they mentions atmos dolby sound, but third class sound in speakers and that option is not working, secondly palm swipe for screen shot is not working camera is so so, very bad product from samsung, I tried all the ways to take screen shots using palm swipe but I can't, if possible pls replace with another item mr amazon"

As soon as I opened the This fraud incident happened to me. I bought Samsung Galaxy M32 smartphone on Friday 6th August 2021 online from Amazon and received it on Monday. As soon as I opened the parcel, I turned on the phone and found that it was defective.There is the issue of no display with this phone. The same day, I requested a replacement, the phone was to be replaced on 13th Aug 2021, delivery agent comes to my residence for replacement but refused to replace the faulty phone saying that the phone has no display and arguing that he requires to dial  *#06# on the defective phone to get  IMEI number for verification which he will feed on amazon's Software.But it is a well-known fact that on any cellular device like Smartphones IMEI no is printed on the phone, their box, and also on the receipt. I asked him to enter the IMEI number printed on the receipt but he refused. Again Iasked him to wait for few minutes and not to cancel the replacement I will talk to customer care to sort out this problem. But he did cancel the replacement. he might do it intentionally to grab the phonelater on Amazon Assured that the amount will be refunded, but to the date, no money has been transferred, i was contacted costumer care of Amazon  again on 13 August for pickup the defective cellphone samsung M32 ,on 14th August agent comes to my residenti and he also refuse to collect , makeing same excuse that you cell phone was ded so that's why I am not able to collect ....So dear those wo are going to buy any products  from Amazon be aware that Amazon team in india is making a Big Scam with their courier agent ...Please be safe and aware don't buy any product form Amazon .Dear readers. If you want to buy any products online use another online cart , like flipkart , Mintra, Mishu , but never from Amazon boycott Amazon ..."
5,"Amazing phone. I would rank it the best overall phone experience. The pros are obviously known to everyone, the 90hz display is great. The touch feel is literally like butter. Cameras are great. Amazon prime runs in HD so widewine l1 is there. Speakers are loud, not tinny but lack bass. Can't complain.Phone requires careful first time setup to avoid ads as suggested by ranjit sir. No ads encountered yet. Everything works well, side mounted power button /finger print reader is fast and accurate. Light sensor, proximity sensor are flawless. These 2 are typically bad in Chinese phones (mi note 5 pro user) causing display to turn on when in call, so thumbs up.The cons: the processor seemed weak on paper, but the experience is great. Not that I am defending samsung, but a compromise 90% can blindly make. I do not play games, so can't say much but better processor phones out there. This is for general public who wants smooth experience of samsung phone and no software bugs.Some complained of emmc5 storage, but apps installed damn fast and I did not find and sluggish read write speed issue. Fast and phone did not heat during setup process when installing 100s of apps and no slowness observed. I have 2 m30s in house, they also pointed out better build quality, better looks of my black version and fluidity of screen. Good for light gaming. Go ahead with the phone for good vibes throughout phones life. Now samsung is giving 3 years of software updates, so great."
1,"Display is good and bright. Battery  average. It's not that speed being 6gb ram, while making  call it lags. Camera not upto mark, I miss grand camera which was better  than 64 mp. Over priced, don't have basic features  of other M series phone. On the name of brand Samsung started cheating people.  They should  atleast  provide  cover."
3,"After purchasing Samsung M12, was looking forward to getting M31, but the mobile was not available and the prices increased. After waiting for a month, saw that M32 is available so purchased it but not entirely happy with it. The phone rings on its own at times, chimes continuously other times without any call or notification being given. Phone lags at time and opening apps also takes time. Perhaps the 6gb variant is better but I have 4gb model. OneUI was supposed to be stable and I am quite disappointed with this particular purchase at least."
1,"This is my first review of Any product purchsed online. I'm shopping online since ages now. But this Phone FORCED me to write a review.I've been Using Asus Zenfone phones till date for my usage, Had a wonderful experience....First time ever shifted to Samsung just because of so called Brand Name.WORST DECISION.Camera OK.Battery OK.Performance OK.Screen OK.Brightness OK.Within 1 week Lock switch stopped working.I'm locking and unlocking by screen tap option because samsung people have said it'll take time to repair.Body completely cheap plastic material.Heats up with normal usage.When in pocket automatically wakes up and starts typing numbers or dials emergency number.With No disregard to Samsung I'm saying very bad phone you've made.Very overpriced. Should be of 9k or less.Others opinions may differ from me. This is just my personal experience.I'm sorry to give you less stars Samsung but please improve your quality not quantity. There is no mandate to launch new phone every week."
4,Pros: Screen resolution is good. Speed and performance is ok ok. Sometimes got little sluggy during parallel execution. Camera is very good quality. Battery life is good. SW is really smooth. Speaker is louder enough. Finally it's not a Chinese brand.Cons: No 4k or HDR video viewing. So some videos are blurry even though it is HD. During charging phone gets heated up. Tats may be it has bigger battery. 5G support is not Der since most phones are now with 5G. Price might have been little less to compete Chinese brands.

2,"Best camera quality at 15k Not for gamers only for simple multimedia use and want a secure phone. Yes it lags too much on normal and heavy use .No carrier aggregation by samsung prosser support carrier aggregation only 3 thing is good about this phone camera,display and battery"
5,"Using since last three days ...completely satisfied with everything. In this segment so many phones are available but if i get the SAMSUNG then why i should go anywhere else...Pros:Display - SAMOLED with Full HD, Side Curves make you feel so happy. Brightness is awesome.Sound - Dolby Sound is also good specially with wired headphone.Battery - Without internet 2 days do not worry to charge it and with internet one full day.Call Quality : Also goodVideo Calling - BestCamera : Picture is so goodProcessor - Fast as it comes with 90Hz refresh rate.Cons:Notification LED Indicator is missing but can be managed.RAM could be 8 GB but if you choose the quality then it can be also ignored. 6GB also working fine.Verdict: If you are not a GAMER then blindly you can grab it."
5,"Value for money and best is 90hz super amoled display and 64mp quad camera. Best for listening music and watching videos as it has 6000mah battery goes 1+1/2 day ""but this phone is not for gaming"""
4,"best Non-Chinese smartphone preference under 15K | Excellent battery | Decent Camera | Smooth | Stylish look | Mummy Loved it ( I gifted it to her)Not made for chhapri youth icons of India.Not the best camera phone under 15K.for gaming under 15k > Motorola G40 / POCO is better option.if you are a decent user, who loves to watch videos/ browse social apps then definitely go for this.for Mumma/PAPA this would be best choice rather than Chinese smartphones.(Thumbs UP) BATTERY : Screen On Time > More than 13H for Mumma. she watches Jio Tv & browse social apps quite often.(Processor) MTK G80 doesn't lag much as compare to Exynos processors + it is better optimized for battery consumption. example Samsung M21 2021 with same 6k mAh battery with Exynos processor gives 7-9h Screen on time only, while Samsung m32 with same 6K mAh battery with MTK Processor gives more than 10-12H screen on time."
2,Waste of money. Don't but this phone. I'll not recommend it to anyone. Today I received  this and within 24 hours am reviewing  the product.  It's not worth . Camera is bad. MI is much much much better. I shud have listed to other reviews  before buying this.
2,"Seeing few YouTube videos,I purchase it,  It's 7-Days now.Processor is G80 , Which Don't support 90Hz& Don't support 2k Videos & Pics.,But, People who use for minimum usage like 2-3hr YouTube,  Amazon videos good.Most time it's 60hz , so, u feels Videos üìπlag ,When u take FHD pic it takes 2-4sec to save it.I am feeling M40 which I got 3-years back is much faster..So, Always go with Snapdragon processor.."
5,"The youtuber reviews will tell you that this phone doesn't have a powerful processor that others will offer you at this price range. It is a fantastic mobile for an average user like me. You should have to look what your purpose of the mobile you want purchase. If you want to play games like pubg and you want professional video/photoshoot this phone is not definitely not for you. It is good to watch youtube videos at high quality with samsung's amazing samoled screen, it can take some good photos and videos and can do some games even pubg at minimal settings.I thing like this people who drive  vehicle at a speed of 60 k.m per hour wants a car that have very powerful engine and they will never need that much power. Like that I don't need a very high performing processor and other features that I may not use.So think, if you are a person who only wants to use mobile for to make and take call and watch videos and occasionally wants to play some game, then this mobile is definitely for you.My job is some what risky and I need automatic call recorder to deal with my risky customers. This mobile has that feature. Its my purpose and that's why I bought this phone.Its a good phone an average customer."
5,"In love with this beast in reasonable price, camera quality is really great, screen resolution is far far clear and colour full, battery is strong, light weight, compact size, all required smart phone features are build in the phone. Good job Samsung team."
1,Do not buy. There are plenty of other good options for the price. Main issue is the PROCESSOR.  I just felt it's too slow compared to  the mobiles available.  Phone is also bit thick . And I think its manufacturing is stoped too.  It's only sold online. If I had a chance I would buy a different phone .
4,"Don't waste money on redmi or realme jst in sake for money. This phone is very nice for decent users. It is an all-rounder in all tasks, but for decemt usage. Camera is very nice than redmi, realme, oppo etc. Notch is very small and does not disturb. One UI 3.1 has tons of features to customize. My rating 8.5/10.All the Best!"
5,Great product. Bought it for display and battery.Cons...Processor is not powerful enough to draw 90hz. Battery is also drained so fast while use 90hz refresh rate.So I switched back to 60Hz. Performance improved and battery lasts longer than before.
5,"Brilliant camera, huge battery life and brilliant display in addition with the premium feeling of SAMSUNG. It's a shame that this phone's launch was delayed due to lockdown.Highly Recommended phone üòäüòä"
5,As a title it is obviously a monsterAnd very very good performance
3,"I am writing my review after using it for 6 days.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range."
1,"Very poor performance. Hangs aloft. Even I don't use any gaming app. In browsing only, this phone lacks. Inspite of having 6 GB RAM. This product serves zero rating. Please don't buy  this. Wastage of money. No refund policy for this device."
5,"Its a one season wonder. All was good till the one year mark.I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great for one year. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I was more than satisfied TILL ONE YEAR.After the one year and two month mark the phone started to automatically restart and freeze every 5 minutes of usage. Went to Samsung care and they said the motherboard has issues and need to be replaced and asked me to pay Rs 8000 since the warranty period was over. To my surprise the issue was not only with my phone. Many M21 buyers had the same issue, although some were lucky enough to have replaced the motherboard in warranty period.So my point is this phone is not a Rs 14499 phone instead it is a Rs 14499 + Rs 8000 phone if you want it to use it more than 1 year. In brief it is a Rs 22499 phone. You can get better phones in this price range.AVOID AT ALL COST"
2,Even realme performs better.....few issues which concerned me after use were1. When recording slow motion videos...there is  always flicker on screen.2. fingerprint sensor needs more than few attempts to work3. Camera is better than realme but not as good as redmi4. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming5. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone6. Mobile data connection vanishes many times in a day...I thought it was my airtel network .....but the same sim works on my old volte phone...without any issue....Suggestions for people who have bought this phone.....Since company does not provides a screen guard..... Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early...Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone.....If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....I am attaching two videos one in normal mode.....second in slow mode.....both videos are made by m21......you can see the flikr effect in second video easily..
5,Very Nice Mobile good all
1,Heating problem. In simple browising only phone gets heated up in upper side. When asking for replacement amazon customer care they are fooling us. Very pathetic condition.
1,"The phone(M21 Raven Black) is not working properly since its purchase. After the first installation, it is on frequently on and off mode and even restarts after more than 30 minutes. Moreover 4-5 times it takes more than 2 hours for starting.I also register a complaint to Amazon regarding this. I don't need such a disgusting phone any more. it wastes my 3 days. So, I request to Amazon kindly refund my money, I don't need replacement."
5,Just one word AMAZING
1,Now Amazone has REPLACED THE DAMAGED ONE NOW THE PHONE IS GOOD ENOUGH...PREVIOUS ONE WAS Nonsence What A Nonsence Battery It Comes to 90% Charge After a full charge only if u do something in10 minutes.... What nonsence is this. NEED REPLACEMENT. Do you people think customers are Mad.
1,"After 5 hrs continuously  charging level reach 55 %,during call sound quality not clear,a lot of heating problem,camera quality not good,network issue,slow processing..poor performance"

5,"I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.üòÄ"
1,"Samsung m21 Mobile not in the delivery box, only charger and pin are available. Need refund for the same.For mobiles, its better to opt for cash on delivery, to avoid getting cheated."
4,"Looks like just to clear the unsold stock of m30s they gave it a new name and advertised it as a totally new phone. Everything is similar to m30s, except the price (and selfie camera). Good thing is that they kept the price low.Just got it delivered today. So far so good, many users compalined about battery, charging speed, display issues on m30s. Hope they got it resolved in m21."
1,Samsung Co. Claims that Samsung M21 has fast charging facility and It has 6000 mAh battery but these two claims are totally bogus because I've purchased Samsung M21 and received my order yesterday after using this phone I plugged in charger for charging it took approximate 9 hours to charge the Mobile phone and after full charging approximate 2 hours the Mobile phone battery get reduced 50%. I'm totally disappointed with this phone.
4,A nice looking phone.Light weight because of the plastic body. Performance is pretty good.But it doesn't feel like a 6000 mAh battery. Probably a little shy of that figure. It Drains relatively quickly than what is expected of a 6000 mAh capacity.But overall a product worth it's price. Probably not good for high performance gaming.But expect it to be durable with a low-medium usage.
1,"Don't like this product. It looks, it's already used by someone else. Apps are not downloading. It shows 6 appsare downloading. I'm confused."
3,"It charges very slowly, though they claim that it has fast charging?Has anyone else also facing this issue?"
1,Amazon delivered a defective phone to me and then they don't even receive my call while I tried to approach them.  Buying Samsung Galaxy M21 is waste of money.
1,1. I bought this to gift it to my dear one but I am shocked to see the camera quality of this phone is like 1 mb. I tried all the modes but it enhances the photo brightness automatically and and the photo becomes like a cartoon.2. Tried installing other camera apps but still the quality is poor.3. Tried options for returning but found that there is no option for that.4. Spoke to customer care and they say that they can only replace if the product is damaged and no option for quality related issues. I said that I am ready to buy any other product too. But no response from them.It‚Äôs better to buy from local store than going behind Amazon.
5,Value for money
1,What can I say just after 30 min.of recieving this phone I applied for return my money. Before this phone I already have 2 phone of Samsung's working good but this phone made in India is hot like a oven.I can't take it near my ears .I have to use ear phone.I call customer care they give me different different idea but problem remain same.I don't give advice to buy this product to any one be careful.
3,"I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21.The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED displayThe issues I faced are1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP).4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging.Among all these issues I believe it is an average deal under 13k"
4,"I like the camera quality, screen sensitivity,  and browsing experience. The speed is excellent.I don't like it's sound. The speaker is not the best, sometimes when I put on loud speaker the person I am speaking to will complain they cannot hear me. Plus when I play music the sound is not the best. Also, the phone does not come with original earphones so you have to hustle for that. Lastly it will take 3 hours to charge and still the battery will only last for 24hours."
5,"Display good, battery  performance  after one  week  of use has improved,camera is good,hope Samsung  provides  regular  updates..Excellent  phone  keep good  work  up Samsung üëå"
1,Battery  drain quickly... and phone heat a lot.
1,recently i ordered samsung M21 6GB RAM 128GB Flash.Unboxed and started the phone. it surprised to see so much of heated while booting itself.I tried to inform to Amazon . they tested with some remote diagnostics application surprisingly it showed the temperature is degree.I am using Samsung phones long time. this time my experience with M21 is very very badNew buyers please little careful about heating issue
1,Giving only one star because it compulsory. Sensor not working and heating fast
5,"Realy very very good phone,but stil I did not get,due to covid"
1,Received Samsung M 21 yesterday..highly disappointed  about slow charging and poor quality of camera..did not expect this from Samsung.I suggest not to buy this mobile.
5,I got this phone 11249. Best Display best Battery Good camera and Samsung BrandingSo people must buy this phone this price.Other phone can't beat
4,"Amazing phone But m not satisfied with camera quality, its 48MP? I used samsung galaxy S8 its only 12MP single camera which is good for m21 tripple camera.One more thing is back panel is plastic which is not good looking inthis range ..Its not feel premium with this budget...."
2,"I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s.M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacksM21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50sBattery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick.Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage.Pros:Super amoled screen6000 MaH batteryCons:Signal strength is very poor.(You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app)Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc"
1,Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
4,If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
5,"Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."

4,"I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
3,"COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"
1,"Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. üòû. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone üì±, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% üòÄ. The phone is too lightweight ‚ò∫Ô∏è and very handyüòÑ Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. üòÉ.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. üò≠GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. üò†üò†.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. üò•. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good üëçBut it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. üò†Display quality is too poor. üò´ Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. ü•∫  No led in front of the display.üò∞Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection üò•If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or aboveü§ó with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy."
1,"Compass is not working, showing error as required sensor are not available,And everything is fine."
1,Made in china...The country of origin should be mentioned in the description...Returning the Chinese crap
3,Made in China product
5,"Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
3,Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
2,Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
5,It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
5,"Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
3,Weary good product  very fast delivery
5,"Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
4,"Good mobile,in this corona times if we want quality product for basic regular usage,this Redmi 9a 3 gb /32 bestCamera is average like all entry-level mobiles,Redmi might send an update for small big fixes like every new mobile launch,gcam till now not available,with that quality of camera increasesDesign display very good,slim tall mobileBattery very good,takes 2.5 hours for full charge,so better charge when 40 % battery left.People who are planning to buy 4 gb /64 gb Redmi 9a,don't take it ,best to go for Redmi 9 as we get finger print scanner, slightly better speed,camera and build quality for just 700rs moreSpeed of Redmi 9a is good for 3- 4 appsCons:No gorilla glass protectionNo Secondary noise cancelling mic,this is big mistake by redmi as they give in every mobileNo Finger print scannerFinally under 10,000 rs all Redmi 9 series mobiles are very best as they provide 4 gb ram variant in very price segment,only option we have"
2,Phone is good. But it is made in China
5,Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
1,"I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available. You can replace only. So, please don't buy this worst product. Even for first time im facing that amazon support also not supporting in this issue. I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."
3,"Purchased the 3gb variant of redmi 9a. Following is the review based on 1day of usageProsDisplay and battery backupOuter designLatest Android 10 based miui 12Back cover looks sturdy (less chances of falling off your hand)ConsPolycarbonate back cover vibrates when phone is on full volumeNo fast charging, takes 2 hr 45 minutes to fully chargeNo notification light (a big bummer)No Gorilla glass protectionNo fingerprint sensor however face unlock works fineVerdictA decent entry level phone however no need to exchange if u r using redmi 8a. If you can squeeze in a few more bucks, then there are many good phone for 9k."
4,"So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5‚≠ê for thatPros-‚Ä¢Low price, wont get any other phones in this range‚Ä¢ Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.‚Ä¢Good for basic usage.‚Ä¢Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:‚Ä¢camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)‚Ä¢Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use‚≠ê"
3,A little bit slow..I think it will more lagged afterwards..Big screen.Camera is not good.. As well as selfie..Ph is For normal users..
5,Best phone you can get at this segment totally worth the amount you are paying
2,Worst camera ever...both front & back... & Screen resolution is not good.

1,Don‚Äôt buy this product .Image quality is below average comparing with the specification. Useless camera.And there is NO RETURN POLICY and replacing with same mobile is big headache .DON‚ÄôT buy this mobile
4,"Let‚Äôs make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve ‚Äî the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in ‚Äî the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricingüá©¬†üá™¬†üá∏¬†üáÆ¬†üá¨¬†üá≥¬†Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I‚Äôd still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What‚Äôs more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn‚Äôt strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.üá©¬†üáÆ¬†üá∏¬†üáµ¬†üá±¬†üá¶¬†üáæ¬†The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it‚Äôs large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it‚Äôs an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it‚Äôs just not bright enough.üÖ±üÖ∞üÜÉüÜÉüÖ¥üÜÅüÜàThe battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow ‚Äî the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?üÖ≤üÖ∞üÖºüÖ¥üÜÅüÖ∞There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There‚Äôs an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps."
5,Awesome
1,"Very bad experience from Amazon. Very bad camera quality of the phone. I want to return the phone, but amazon is not taking back the phone. I don't want to purchase any product from amazon further. Leaving amazon app permanently"
5,Best buy at this price! The display quality is amazing and I do not have any complaint with the camera too. There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.
4,i didn't upload photo ....for any reason but it is not up to the mark .1.display 4/52.cam 3/53.fing sens.. 4.5/54.processor 3/55.build quality 3.75/5back panel is not good looking coz some self design as per my opinionin this price segment rs 9000 is good enough
1,This phone is not value for moneyIts a downgraded phone of earlier phone launched in india.The camera is worst i ever seen in any redmi phone.Battery is ok.The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.Dot notch display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera.Recently i am using redmi note 5 pro. And this phone is just downgraded phone by redmi .you cannot imagine low light photography in this phone.The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 prime.
5,Good product value for money but ordering is too difficult within one minute soldout
4,Product is best at this price but charging speed is very slow but we cannot accept more then this at this price
5,Good mobile
3,"Processor is bit slow, camera is below average except that everthing works fine. I personally don't like MIUI because of lots of ads and bloatwares. But, good budget range phone if you ignore/adjust this issues."

4,Overall its good and satisfied for the price.Pros:1. Good Battery.2. Best budget phone for 8999 with 4GB RAM and 64GB Internal Memory.The only drawback i felt is Camera.If you are looking for a better camera I would suggest to pick some other model.
5,best good product prive battry camera all very good
5,GOOD
1,"It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile."

3,"Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3.

Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5.

If u r buying the mobile for this feature then I'm afraid u may get disappointed, it's just normal.The USB cable is too small in lengthIt's a good mobile in this budget, there are no returns for this,  only replacement is available, hence choose wisely before buying"
3,Camera quality is low
1,"1. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.2. Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one.3. Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.4. No return policy, you will have to live with the phone you didn't like. Now you decide."
1,"Not worth buying....faulty software, poor display quality, single band wifi doesn't support  5ghz WIFI band. Gyro sensor missing and many more. DONT GO BY PAID REVIEWS IN YOU TUBE"

1,Hitting issue
1,Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don't waste money on this product.
1,"Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price."
5,"This is perfect phone, good speed, decent specs and outstanding battery life. The look of the device is also attractive. Above all, the trust of company."
1,"PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
1,"Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don't buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI."
1,Dislike
2,"Product specifications are not at par..Display is below average.Camera quality is just okay..It doesnt support 5ghz wifi, which is not mentioned anywhere so please make sure before buying.."
1,Self camera is just like 2 mega pixels.
1,"The user experience is pathetic on these cheap phones. Its filled to the brim with bloatware that you can't remove.You're better off getting the Mi phones as they have a far better UIAlso, I can't return this garbage of a phone as Samsung don't list this as a software issue.I'll have to look into installing lineage os and de-google this phone before using it but that's easier said than done."
1,Just for name sake Cam & Battery are 48mp & 6000mah. But coming to reality it is poor. The weight of the phone also almost 250gm so it is not a smart phone it is a hard phone. And the top menu bar beside front cam is not responding sometimes.
5,"A very satisfying  experience with the device so  far.Pros:1. Long battery life-  I am a moderate  user who does everything  except gaming. That said , the battery lasts up to 2 full days.2. Decent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.3. Very responsive finger print sensor.4. Good sound quality, although dolby's impact  is not much pronounced5. UI is great and snappy. Lots of customization options.6. The display is good and smooth with 90hz refresh rate. It does make the difference.7. Fast charging works fine.Cons:1. The weight of the phone is on the heavier side @ 220 gms2. The display could have been a full HD+ @ 1080p3. No led notification light. All though there are apps that can do the job on an AMOLED screen.Overall, a good package."
1,Horrible product
1,"Not a good mobile.Quite heavy in weight, you will obviously feel it. Weight is 220 gms which is far exceeding acceptable range. Can definitely be used as paperweight.Nothing special in screen, processor or camera also.Just a marketing gimmick by samsung.Stay away.. At 13.5k we deserve far better than this."
3,Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn‚Äôt give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you‚Äôre choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you‚Äôll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review
4,I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1. Battery and Camera.1. BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non sense.I played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98% to 80 %2. Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this
1,Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp
1,"This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information."
5,"It's a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they're wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it üòå. Once again no complains regarding anything."
1,Look is average. Battery life is good. Only go ahead if you just need a good brand name otherwise 100 of options are available in market. You will definitely get disappointed with camera which is actually not more than 12 mega pixels.  This phone nothing but a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached. Samsung must call back these phones as it is definitely going to kill the brand name. I will highly appreciate if Amazon has the guts to publish this review. This is an open challenge to Amazon...
2,"The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box"
4,"Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage .  I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck .Awesome battery life , and that's what I want . I am just using it for basic social media and calls .. rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device .CAMERA is average , My ipad's 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called ""true"" 48MP.My advice-- go for 6gb variant as 2.5 gb is acquired by the system .Overall - 4‚òÜ"
1,"Disappointed with this mobile.... PhonePay & GooglePay apps are not working properly.... Numbers visible only half and getting overlapped....and we're end up typing wrong Pin numbers.... multiple times we have changed the Pin for these apps... now a days We regularly use mobile for online payments but this mobile is not useful for online payments due to app issues.We have tried to return this mobile, but Amazon return policy date was over by the time we found the issue."
5,I am using this phone for the last one week and i noticed few positive and negative things about it.Positive points -‚Ä¢ Fingerprint sensor is so fast and i loved it‚Ä¢ Battery backup (6000 mAh) is amazing even after using it throughout the day‚Ä¢ Camera quality is really good and the pictures are amazing on day light‚Ä¢ Large display having a size of 6.5 inches and can run games smoothly on low graphic settings‚Ä¢ 90Hz refresh rate feels so smooth‚Ä¢ The phone doesn't lag or get heated after using it for a long time because of Exynos 850 (8nm) high-end processorNegative points -‚Ä¢ Not made for hard-core gaming because the processor is not strong enough to run games smoothly on high graphics‚Ä¢ The weight of phone is heavy‚Ä¢ The brightness level is somewhat low as compared to other phones‚Ä¢ The display that you will get is around 720 x 1600 pixels‚Ä¢ The downloading as well as uploading speed is also low as compared to other phones within this price range‚Ä¢ It is not water resistant and does not have Gorilla glass for screen protection .~ I am satisfied with this phone because of it's camera quality and battery backup ‚àö
5,Recently only I got this Jiophone. The working of phone is good. But if you are purchasing for Whatsapp operating or any social media operating. This phone could not work out as memory is low to store.This Jiophone is good purchase only to save money on your SIM mobile number working.  Only Jio SIM works it. First time you have to recharge it by ‚Çπ149/- for activation. There after you can purchase ‚Çπ749/- plan special for Jiophone handset users. Unlimited calling for 336 days with 24GB data. Right now this very useful plan compare other mobile networks plans. Just go for it. If want to save money.üëåüëåüëåüëåü§óü§óü§óü§óüëçüëçüëçüëç
1,Sim is not working
5,Very nice  sound
1,"The Mobile is not meant for resale, but this Unscruplous Vendor is buying the Mobile sets from Jio Stores and Reselling it mat Higher Price. So if you buy it you can not use it, or get it activated at any Jio shop, because they will not activate as it is free with a Jio Plan. Never Buy this and waste your Money. Rather go to a Jio store and buy the Plan and get the Mobile free of cost at lower price.Amazon Should Take Note and Punish Such Unscruplous Sellers and Disallow  to Trade on their Platform."
1,I bought this phone because I saw previous comments in this chat that after getting this phone we need to visit jio store and do a recharge of 125 rs to get 1 year jio free calling pack along with this phone but at the jio store the store keeper clearly denied and said there no recharge like this or there is no offer like that so now I am not using this phone any more it is just waste for me so not satisfied there is no negative rating otherwise I would have given -5
1,Mouth piece is not working at allCould not able to hear voice of this phone user
1,Such a worst product i received...this is for the very first time that i got such bad service from amazon..when i opened the box the seal was already open and the product inside was full of dirt and dust...it had glue all over and i couldn't touch it because of glue... It was broken from sides and surely very old phone... Very disappointing... DON'T BUY THIS
1,"It (F320B) has got all the disadvantages of other jio phone models plus there is no WiFi connectivity.Even though it's running KaiOS, the KaiOS store is removed from it. Google assistant is also not present. Only jio apps can be installed.Performance is very bad because of low RAM and poor CPU. Often becomes hang while using.Like the older models of jio phone, Keypad problem is also there.Battery capacity is also reduced , getting empty within 1 day.Total waste of money"

4,"Let‚Äôs make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve ‚Äî the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in ‚Äî the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricingüá©¬†üá™¬†üá∏¬†üáÆ¬†üá¨¬†üá≥¬†Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I‚Äôd still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What‚Äôs more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn‚Äôt strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.üá©¬†üáÆ¬†üá∏¬†üáµ¬†üá±¬†üá¶¬†üáæ¬†The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it‚Äôs large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it‚Äôs an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it‚Äôs just not bright enough.üÖ±üÖ∞üÜÉüÜÉüÖ¥üÜÅüÜàThe battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow ‚Äî the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?üÖ≤üÖ∞üÖºüÖ¥üÜÅüÖ∞There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There‚Äôs an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps."
5,Awesome
1,"Very bad experience from Amazon. Very bad camera quality of the phone. I want to return the phone, but amazon is not taking back the phone. I don't want to purchase any product from amazon further. Leaving amazon app permanently"
5,Best buy at this price! The display quality is amazing and I do not have any complaint with the camera too. There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.
4,i didn't upload photo ....for any reason but it is not up to the mark .1.display 4/52.cam 3/53.fing sens.. 4.5/54.processor 3/55.build quality 3.75/5back panel is not good looking coz some self design as per my opinionin this price segment rs 9000 is good enough
1,This phone is not value for moneyIts a downgraded phone of earlier phone launched in india.The camera is worst i ever seen in any redmi phone.Battery is ok.The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.Dot notch display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera.Recently i am using redmi note 5 pro. And this phone is just downgraded phone by redmi .you cannot imagine low light photography in this phone.The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 prime.
5,Good product value for money but ordering is too difficult within one minute soldout
4,Product is best at this price but charging speed is very slow but we cannot accept more then this at this price
5,Good mobile
3,"Processor is bit slow, camera is below average except that everthing works fine. I personally don't like MIUI because of lots of ads and bloatwares. But, good budget range phone if you ignore/adjust this issues."

4,Overall its good and satisfied for the price.Pros:1. Good Battery.2. Best budget phone for 8999 with 4GB RAM and 64GB Internal Memory.The only drawback i felt is Camera.If you are looking for a better camera I would suggest to pick some other model.
5,best good product prive battry camera all very good
5,GOOD
1,"It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile."

3,"Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware. Unauthorised data transfer to China.If possible go for Motorola E7 around the same price and you will have great experience with Snapdragon and clean android experience."
3,Charging Adapter came with phone turned out to be defective. stopped working after 2 weeks of purchase.Don't know how to return the adapter or how to claim the warranty on adapter alone.Phone is working fine so far and looks good
1,"The connectivity technology mentioned in the specification, shows that this phone is compatible for GSM, 3G, 4G, LTE. Bought this phone for 4G sim. After inserting the sim card, the phone did not detect the sim card. Later checked in other websites and found that this phone is not compatible with 3G and 4G. Cannot even return the phone as I have brought this phone abroad. Really disappointed with Amazon."
1,"I ordered this product out of trust. When powering on, I realised display was damaged. If this is how your '100% Made in India' products work, it is a sad state. Since only replacement option was available, I had to wait a week more before delivery. Then the delivery boy says he cant take it back because I hadn't mentioned the reason for replacement (incorrect claim). I have called in for a full refund. Very bad response by seller or the area manager. City Vizag."
5,"I wanted a basic mobile for my children when left alone. Happy with the product at RS 750/- with no camera but with Bluetooth, dual sim and memory card slot."
3,Amazon gives irrelevant information. It doesn't support jio 4G
5,"Two sims and a slot for a memory card. Sound quality and working nicely. Easy to operate and other common things like torch, calculator, FM and unwanted games too. In such a less price you get so many things. Unbelievable. I am happy withLava A1 Josh (Black).If they provided a camera then I can sugar in milk.  People can go for it they will be happy with their decision"
5,Best phone this price
1,Produces too much heat while charging and operating like a call. Never fully battery charged even 50%. always shows battery low. Totally worst phone. Never buy it.
5,"Indian companies, when will you guys improve man.- Difficult to open rear case- Battery once inserted won‚Äôt come out (difficult to remove battery)- keypad pressing gives pain in the arm (softer keypad would‚Äôve been better)Learn to make products user friendly.Working people don‚Äôt have time to use a phone which has a difficult-to-open rear-case and a battery which will never come out once it‚Äôs fixed. Look at foreign companies. They make user friendly and comfortable to use products.Your products must make life easyI bought this phone purely out of Respect for Indian Flag (to encourage Indian make companies). I should have bought a Nokia or a Samsung instead.Please don‚Äôt buy anything because they are Indian made unless you want to suffer. Please go with quality and ease of use."
5,Best product for non camera users.
4,"Very good phone. Value for money you pay for it. Only one drawback is that it doesn't have vibration alerts, due to which you have to always keep it on general Profile. Overall the best phone in this price range."
5,Lava A1 Josh has good supporting features which makes easy to operate the phone at different situations.Text clarity of the display on reading is outstanding.Best performance in sound quality with many options for flexible operation.Phone is handy with optimum size display.Signal pick up for dual sim is good.Voice clarity is good in the good range of signal.FM operation with headset Free is better on good range of signals. Supports too with FM recording.No camera with multimedia options and external memory.Supports 1200 contact phone storage is good and LAVA may see to increase to 1500.Very simple and easy to operate with the support of different regional languages.Battery back up for the full day is OK.Phone back cover found to be slippery may be improved for grip.Good phone with more options in the least price.Proudly Indian.
5,"LAVA A1 Josh...Perfect for secondary device.Got it for 865/-I love it..Compact, basic and value for money with 1yr warranty..After looking at quality of this phone, I can say for sure that it is brother of NOKIA....."
4,"Forget Nokia, Samsung basic phones, this lava a1 Josh is as good as them  with affordable price, looks are attractive, branded like.. you wouldn't feel you helding any cheap price phone in hand.-battery is long lasting..-ring volume is good loud,-Bluetooth is good-mic is good,-auto call record works very fine,-signal reception and call quality is as good as branded phones,.-Torch is good,-In call in ear call voice is super clear, loud, beautiful- Problem is jus screen display clarity is very poor ,- in call loud speaker voice is not clear at allRest all things are very good, those who don't need last 2 things then I will highly recommend this phone over Nokia, Samsung basic phones"
5,"It serves the purpose of a mobile for those who are not very tech savvy but want to keep a mobile for obvious reasons...battery consumption is low. Many year back, when it was launched, I bought it, without knowing much about Lava...but I am very happy owner , it is still working trouble free without battery replacement..."
1,Don't buy this product Handset has network problem between live call it suddenly goes out of coverage area and call disconnected i replace this product one time but second product were also given same problem I think all lot are faulty so don't waste your money
5,It is almost sractch proof. Looks nice in white colour. Build quality is as good as samsung. Battery charge lasts for 4 to 5 days. I recommend this one those looking for basic feature phone.
1,Amazone Cheated shows 3g but it's not 3g . Don't cheat customers
5,"I bought this mobile for my Mother. Actually, she doesn't understand the smartphone's features that's why I purchased that & She is happy to use this now. It's easy to use, Battery Backup is also good & Sound quality is not bad. At this price, I'm so, happy. Thanks, Amazon to provide such Good Products."
4,"It's made of cheap plastic. Not military grade. But if you're looking for a backup phone, and want to listen to music/radio using your BT earphone this phone is best and cheapest option available."
1,"Wrong decision to go for this cheap product spend 2 to 300 more and go for a Nokia mobile, it it doesn't support the 3.5 5mm Jack and second sim also not working.Disappointed with my decision to go with this product"
5,"Audio is good, had all the emergency contacts including covid. Good touch buttons. Has audio speak out for numbers touched for dialing. Very useful for elders and layman basic usage."
3,There is no signal inside the house. Simply waste of money. All my phones got damaged to I purchased it. Wish I could return the item...
5,"I love this phone, It‚Äôs just perfect as simple phone, Battery back up and further features of the phone are good enough for basic phone"
1,The phone was defective. Sim did not gey detected. The return window closed too soon. Amazon pleaae look into it
3,"Lava A1 Josh Blue Sliver also (white) battery life is so poor quality ,only one day battery life time validity period,also phone support only micro sim card, when you buy a phone see reviews ,it will help you get a good phone.."
5,I bought this for my maid and she seems pleased with it.  Easy enough for her to use and loud enough to be heard.  The torch is useful too in power cuts!
5,"value for money.. love the white color, small and light weight , nice design"
4,Better than nokia and Samsung Guru series. Audio quality is fine. Memory card option at 900 rupees. Can basic get any better? Bought twice for those working under me.
5,"If you're looking for a keypad phone this phone is best choice. Network quality,sound quality is at its best and wireless radio works fine. Good effort from an Indian company."
2,Very cheap phone and have great battery life. I don't get lots of calls so my charging lasts for 6 days. Preferred it as it's indian manufacture.But memory card not detected by it
5,I think the best in this price range as compared to other brands phone like Nokia 105Best Sound qualityFMAudio playerVideo playerBluetooth work well
5,"Every feature is so good and value for money really true. Battery life four days... excellent... Bluetooth feature ... Excellent.... Power saver mode... Excellent.... only absence of vibration in call...but except this, all the features so good"
4,bought it for my labour who works daily outdoor. he is absolutely satisfied
1,"as compared with cost it is not user friendly, no ear phones, no options for ringtone"
5,Dual sim.. not reading memory card.. don't know.. rest all is good and sturdy phone
5,Received fast delivery via Amazon. Good working. üëç less in weight and size. Compacted design. Volume in ring tone alone is too high we need to reduce. Options are not user friendly like nokia.
5,Really light weight mobile great battery life auto call recording available with audio recording as well buy it if you're looking for normal feature phone with great featuresPs I've purchased in 866 if ur getting in lower buy it
1,No. It is wrong selection based in wrong specification given in particular s of product. Specification mentions camera but there is no camera to this model. My return request for replacement with other model with camera & bluetooth is not entertain. So for the first time I am not satisfied with purchase.
5,"Pretty Happy. It has everything I wished for.Upgrading from an S9 after 3 years.A good camera, waterproofing, strong processor, high battery life and headphone jack 3.5mm were my basic requirements.It has everything except the 3.5 mm jack. Compromised on that because I was getting rest.I do not play games but WiFi for majority of hours, 99+ tabs on Firefox and Chrome, many vudeo callings on 4G network (Jio) and heavy PDF files are operating simultaneously on my phone. Along with occasional YT Video.Earlier, S9's (Exynos 9810, 4GB RAM) never lagged on this routine and after 3 years, now it started to.Initially, was considering the A52 as it also had all needs. It had the 3.5 mm jack in it, but the compromise there was the Camera and processor.Went through the details of the Snapdragon processor on A52, and realized that procoessor is not even close to the flagship processor, received earlier on S9. (Exynos 9810). That was the deal breaker for me as A52 will not be even able to handle current requirements, let alone future ones. I think A52 has SD730G or 720G. S9 with Exynos 9810 is faster than that chipset. The A52 5G may or may not be launched and even that has 750G which is not equal to S9's old one. These are facts available online. After paying 30-35k for A52/A72, one is getting a processor that was not even equal to the 3 year old Samsung Flagship of S9 (9810).People would be suprised to know that pairing 8GB or 12 GB RAM with low-mid/mid processors will give you *less* performance than having lesser RAM on Top End processors.It is with this need, kade the decision to purchase S20 FE 5G. It has a better camera. and the Snapdragon 865 is future proof and will take care of my needs for 3 years comfortably without lags.Other phone that was considered was Asus ROG 5, It has everything needed at nearly same price point. Mainly, the 6,000 Mah battery. There the compromise was on Camera and Waterproofing. Was also concerned about Asus after sales support. Samsung after sales support is best in India as I have witnessed it my self. People should also consider this. That how good the company is in After sales support.5G was not a concern. Satisfied with 4G speeds and where heavy speeds are needed, prefer to use WiFi fiber based. Also, no phone currently sold in India is 5G proof, as it is not known which 5G bands will be brought to India by Government.The Camera is great and have put a 512GB Sandisk Ultra Card inside.This is the best phone available from Samsung right now and the definitely among the top 3 by any standards in the whole market. One cannot go wrong with this.ChargerIt has a 15W inside while phone supports 25W. Personally I am not bothered because 15W is good for battery life and health. Fast Charging reduces it. The difference is also small. Difference would be great if phone supported 65W and then we were given a 15W one. 15W will improve your battery life.Never considered the OnePlus as it's a Chinese brand. I try to avoid Chinese one as much as possible. Also the S20 FE 5G is assembled in India in Noida, U.P. OP9 is full direct import, even the box. It has been 10 months since Galwan, but we must never forgetEdits1) DisplayPhone supports 120Hz. Looks Beautiful. But I do not use it. Battery difference is significant. Around 1-2  hours. 60Hz lasts longer. So...2) Camera - I am happy. Photos look even better on laptop (after transfer) :D.3) Battery Life- takes 2 hours 13 minutes for full charge with 15W charger. Battery is 4,500 Mah. First 50-60% were very fast. After that charge happens slowly- lasts 1 and a half day with my normal use, which is heavy. (see above). 1st day ended with 36% :D- Woke up next morning to find it at 27%.- Lasted till around 3 p.m.- Make your own conclusions4) I do not play games. No comments on how battery is affected when we play games5) What's in the Box?- no silicone cover, no earphones- charger you get is 15W. *It is Type C to Type C Charger* (You cannot use old chargers with normal USB port)- SIM ToolWhat I do not like/A bit surprised- Phone is *Heavy*- If you are those who like to read/browse on phone for extended hours (I use Kindle often), you will feel real strain within 15 minutes. (At least I do) Maybe, because last phone was very light. Hopefully, arms adjust soon.This comparison is not meant to denigrate A52/A72's processors. They just do not fit the use patternDo not buy 3rd party Type C to 3.5mm jacks available on Amazon. From Samsung Shop, purchased the original Samsung supported jack available for 699. Good 3rd party ones on Amazon are selling fro 999/899. Their compatibility is suspect. Jacks are beneficial over Bluetooth based ones because jacks reduce the battery charge. Using 3.5mm jack easily saves 10-12% over 2-3 hours.I have not experienced luckily any heating till now from phone.Edit 2 - Pics- butterfly pics. Please Note, I am no professional photographer. But this butterfly pic is at very high zoom. It is taken from good distance. Could not go near it. I am happy with the camera's zoom capabilities.Thanks for reading till here"
5,"Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store:1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option.2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers.3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good.4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging.5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well.6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9.7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch.8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9.9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9.10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger.Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences."
3,"no sim card pin, there was no headphone. packing was not up to the mark ,with respect to the price of the productThe product heats up very fast"
2,Bought this a day backAt this price range I felt this phone is a crap.Here are the reasons why1) Terrible heating issue near to the camera with moderate usage - Might be from the processor2) Battery optimization  sucks - with moderate usage it dint lasted for 7 hours3)Only 15W Charger will be in the box3) At this price range competitors provide better finger print reader4) cheaper corilla glass 3 is used5) Snapdragon  860 and 865 has some heating issues  and other issues6)Back design makes this phone less premiumOverall at 40k price - This phone in not woth for the money üòë ...if you're looking for mid flagship camera..then you can go for this phone.Considering  the heating issue this phone rate will drop further.. When it drops to 30k you can buy this phone
5,"I was using OnePlus 5t for last 3 years. Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone.Pros:1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above.2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want.3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers..4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though.Cons:1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal.2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though.3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better.4. Fingerprint reader could have been better.Edit:OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion."
5,"Writing this review after 3 months of usage.Will divide this review into pros and cons.First, the Pros:1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience.2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously.. I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products.3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great.4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point.5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately.6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience.7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance.8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing.9.5G ready with 9 5g bands.Cons:1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range.2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times.3.Average front camera.Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer."
5,"For the price of 48k, I see this device as the perfect balance between performance, value and future proof. I bought this instead of OnePlus 9 and 9R and do not regret this decision at all."
1,Pros:Good displayStereo speakerIP68Wireless chargingCons:Battery drains very fastFingerprint is laggyBelow average camera qualityVery old gorilla glass3 on the front.Plastic back panel.No specifications about camera lens protective glass.Cannot view HDR content from NetflixNo DAC for audio over Type-C headphones. Only digital audio over Type-C USB port.Cannot use wired headphones with any Type-C adapters.Very high price for such a product.
1,Everything was good but I found a manufacture defect it it. A click sound was coming from the back side whenever a put the phone on any surface. While slowly shaking the phone the sound frequency increased.I talked to customer support for replacement and they did it successfully.Received the new phone but truly disappointed.Found same issue like the 1st one.Placed a return request for it.üôè
4,"I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly.1) DisplayDisplay is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed.2) Battery lifeAt 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this.The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too.3) CameraCamera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that.4) SoftwareYou can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years.5) ProcessorI bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya.Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others.My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace."

5,"The best among the budget flagship smartphones in the market. I am extremely satisfied with this.If you can compromise without a 3.5mm headphone jack and a physical proximity sensor (although there is a virtual proximity sensor to compensate but it doesn't work like the physical one), then this will be a better choice than One Plus 9."
1,"The phone itself is great. Camera is pretty nice. Especially for me as I am trying to upgrade from S10 Lite. Primarily wanted to buy this for wireless charging and water resistance. However, one massive issue in the unit that I got today‚Ä¶ Wi-Fi is extremely glitchy. My S10 Lite remains stable on 866mbps in network details. S20 FE fluctuates anywhere form ~300-500mbps. If this was not bad enough, the phone‚Äôs Wi-Fi speed drops hugely when it gets slightly warm. My 300mbps connection barely registers 15-20mbps on this phone. Should mention here that there are lots of isolated cases of S20 series phones having similar issues online. From Samsung‚Äôs own support forum to XDA to reddit and other Android communities.If you buy this phone, my recommendation would be to keep an eye on the wi-fi performance. WiFiMan is a great app would show the connection speed with router (internet speed is irrelevant here if you are not on a gigabit connection). On my device it fluctuates heavily with upload speed falling down to 6mbps regularly and staying there for long periods. This could very well be Samsung throttling Wi-Fi modem to save battery I imagine. But this could end up hurting longer downloads or creating slowdowns while doing simple tasks.I ended up applying for a refund. I love this phone but I cannot rely on Samsung on fixing the unreliable wifi in a future software update. They need to acknowledge the problem in Sep 21 batch."
1,"Thank you so much samsung for sending a defective phone. You made the first impression to last for very long. What happened to Good old fashion of testing the product before packaging. You have started making phones costlier and costlier for Indian market (even if it is made in India). The quality level, and amount of h/w features have gone down over the years.Thanks to amazon for prompt response for replacing the product. Hope, this time i will get a working phone."
5,"Just loved it. It offers unbelievably everything what you could wish for. Writing this review after around 20 days of use.Well the major pros:1. Look wise the phone is awesome.2. Ultra Smooth UI, loved the One UI 3.1 (first time using Samsung ).  A combination of 120 Hz, Super AMOLED and Snapdragon 865 makes it awesome3. Camera is exceptional. OIS works great which is missing in OP. I have attached images for references:  a. Moon Image is taken at 30X Zoom just with hands without tripod, see how stabilised that is.  b. Night mode is ultimate, believe me it can capture what eyes can't see  c. Day light, colour reproduction is great. Loved the Ultra Wide and Zoom cameras, both do the job with perfection.  d. Videos are very smooth, and it supports 4K upto 60fps. Slow motion and Ultra slow motion both work great.4. 5G support is there with 9 bands, although couldn't test anything in India.5. Fingerprint, Face recognition works pretty fast.6. Used Samsung Pay for the first time, it is awesome and something missing in all others. Just added my card it that, and tapped phone to pay directly. It authenticates using Fingerprint.7. It supports 15W Fast Wireless charging, which works flawless.8. Battery life is great, When I am not using it much, easily gives 2 days (46 hours) at 60Hz display. There are multiple ways to save battery. Initially battery consumption was more. It takes i think 6-7 days to learn the usage pattern by Android 11. After that it puts the un-used apps to sleep and deep sleep. Battery life increases to almost double after this9. Feature I loved the most - the phone is IP68, I have tested it multiple times, putting under Tap water and rain. Just don't charge when port is wet. Phone will warn itself with a notification.10. Supports upto 1 TB micro SD through hybrid SIM slot, so 2nd SIM has to be compromised, so I am not using it.Cons:1. Charging is bit slow, not like dash charge.2. Wireless charging is also not that fast.3. Screen brightness is a bit low, compared to higher end phones, but perfect when compared to lower ends.I recommend this over OP, until you are only into Gaming. It is not jack of all, its actually a king, with just a compromise from Snapdragon 888 to 865."
2,"Edit: May 22, after a month of use : Amazon providing 6K off now, no wonder whyCons:1. Finger scanner is works only 6/10 times. May 22: Little better after the recent software upgrade2. Felt heat in the back even with very less usage. Understand that the phone have SD 865 and a external modem which means heat will be continued issue for this phone.3. Face reorganization will not work in low light (iPhone 11 unlocks very smooth in the same lighting condition)4. It felt like a very old model phone5. Volume and power button are in the same side (very hard to use)6. Low light photos are horrible7. Take ~5 hours for full charge. Battery discharge very fast if you have any peripheral connected to it.8. Videos will not play in full screen because of screen bezel in the top.Pros:1. Good for basic photo2. Phone is not large but heavy with 4500 mah battery3. Sound and voice call quality is good4. 120 Hz refresh rate is buttery smoothWith my one month observation, I will not recommend S20 FE 5G, recommends iPhone 11 128GB based on my usage of both phones."
1,Worst mobile ever from a brand like Samsung.....when I got the delivery I was so excited and it disappeared with in 1hr of using the device...it was getting heated and getting an air space sound between the panel and the battery...the performance of the mobile was 5star....but the battery won't even remain for 3hr if u play pubg.....even if I browse and take the at the same time for more than 20-30mins the phone gets heated like a pan....so please guys don't go for this mobile in such a huge price and finally I got the replacement and again the same issue....so returned it....tq Amazon for refuding my money
5,Good choice over other phones in same price segment.Fingerprint is average. After some settings changed its perfect and fast. And if u use always on display u can locate the fingerprint sensor and unlock screen fast. Better to use face its very good.Battery life is nice.And camera is superb. Far better than oneplus 9 series.Overall good product.
5,"Got it recently and playing with it for a while, I can tell you I am quite satisfied  with  it and it's featuresüòÑ. I can tell quite a lot of good things but I'll stop it's already  listed in the description.üòâDisplay is very good üëç, Battery backup is good.But I should have 0.5 star as my only complaint is it gets warm way to early while doing things, normal people shouldn't worry about it only little warm in intensive tasks like games and heavymultitasking. Hope things get better after an update. üòÄ"
5,"In this era of 2MP macro-mono-depth stupidity in midrangers and budget-flagships, this device stands out with its pure functional and flagship-like camera setup. DEX is another amazing functionality, i wonder why people are not mentioning it in reviews. Samsung has promised 4 years of security updates and 3 android major updates. There are 9 5G bands, so i assume this phone is truly 5G-ready in India. These points were enough for me to shift to this phone. I read some reviews complaining heating issues and ordinary design of this phone. Though I am not a heavy gamer, I use my phone for a long consecutive times. It only got warm during initial setup. But there was NO heating issue otherwise. About design, it is a personal choice. I am not a fan of glass backs (am i the only one on this planet?) Phone still looks very premium in my opinion.I switched from OP5 after almost 4 years. OP5 was one-of-its-kind, and was ahead of its time. Sadly oneplus is no more the enthusiast brand that it was some years ago. Single band 5g, shady updates (i heard op7, op7t got slower with the updates), and i just hate that 2/5 MP mono camera  that op is standardizing these days. Concluding, Samsun S20 FE 5G is a perfect choice for someone who is looking for non flashy, simple design yet truly functional and non-gimmicky experience in a device that can be used for around 3-3.5 years."
4,"I've used this phone for a month and a half now.Here's my review for the same -1. Camera is really good 9/102. Audio quality is good, though the volume is a little on the lower side 6/103. Battery life is decent, I can mostly get through the day without having to charge it 7/104. Charging is too slow, like the older generation phones without any fast charging. Takes 2hrs for my phone to charge fully. Update - The 25w charger fills it up pretty fast. Takes around an hour. 4/105. Display is good and smooth 9/106. OneUI. This is my first samsung phone and I loved the software's look and feel, how the notifications and app drawer have amazing blur effects in the background. There are still a few bugs here and there though 8/107. Fingerprint reader is slow but accurate 5/108. Face recognition fails most of the time, to a point that I've stopped using it now 1/109. Call quality and audio is amazing on this phone. It is very loud and crispy clear 10/1010. The phone gets heat up a lot, on the upper side of the body and screen, while charging as well as gaming. I'm actually scared to buy the 25w charger thinking that it might make the phone heat up even more 7/10 Update - I got the 25w charger and it didn't heat up at all."
1,"Like: cameraScreen touch is decentDislikeSelfish camera is not upto the mark, I have one plus 5t and it's selfish camera is more natural then s20 feAmount of time it takes to charge the device almost 2 hrs.UICalling option does not have direct changing  option for Sim cardsI am not able to return the productStuck with itDevice is hanging"
1,"I purchased this expensive Samsung phone for the first time in my life from Amazon, I missed few days from the return period to inform that my phone doesn't get calls or sms at all as it took some time to understand. The customer care roited me to Samsung service center and service center won't replace your brand new product, instead they'll repair it for you as you've bought it from Amazon not Samsung shop. I'm feeling helpless and disgusted by Amazon customer support."
3,"This phone comes with a IP68 rating. I have been using this phone for last 3 months. Presently it is having some charging problem.It is showing that moisture or foreign material is there in charging port. Same need to be dried or removed prior to using that port for  charging. In the mean time wireless charger can be used to charge the phone.After seeing this,  I took my mobile to Samsung care. There they said that the charging port is completely damaged because of moisture ingress. Same need to be replaced. And this will cost around Rs 1850.!!!! No free service within warranty periodüòî !!!!So I request all the potential buyers to answer this.Q-1) If having a IP 68 rating mobile cannot resist moisture attack, then what's the point.Q-2) Within warranty period and for a IP68 rating phone, whether a customer need to pay for any damage because of moisture ingress."
5,"I purchased this phone after extensive research (~5 months) of YouTube reviews as well as real ownership experience from family and friends of many phones in the 25k to 40k INR price bracket.I was able to get this one at 38k after exchange of my existing phone.Have to say that this is the best one in this price range and even under 50k.All flagship features that a person would want are available at this price.And I'm speaking from experience of having used iPhone XS and OnePlus 7T Pro of my own parents.Haven't faced any heating (or even warming) issue except during initial setup.For people who still aren't convinced, I will update my review after using for 2 weeks and then again after a month if needed.Edit (25-06-2021): After 2 weeks of extensive usage, I can still confirm that I have faced zero heating issues and very rare ""warming"" from this phone.One suggestion which I would make to existing and potential owners of this phone is to go to Settings->Connections->Mobile networks and change it to LTE/3G/2G from the existing 5G option.I'm still getting maximum 4G and 4G+ speeds without the phone having to search for non-existant 5G networks in India.For Screen-on-time, I'm consistently getting ~6.5 hours(Display at 120Hz), easily lasting a full day and having to recharge only the next day.P.S: If you are a hardcore gamer and are willing to shell out 40k+ on a phone then ROG phones would be better for you.In all other aspects, this phone takes the cake.P.P.S : If you don't have a pair of Bluetooth earphones already and don't plan on getting one either, just buy the official Samsung Type C to headphone jack adapter. Works brilliantly well! Just google Samsung EE-UC10JUWEGIN"
5,"Bought on 25th Apr. Have been using samsung since ages and was looking for a decent phone with good camera, screen and battery life. This phone covers all.While initiating and data transfer, did get a little hot but nothing post that. Most of the time is spent on calling including Whatsapp (3-4 hours) and watching serials (5-6) hours and general net surfing (2-3 hours). Once charged in the morning, till night still 30% battery is left. No heating issues at all.The 120Hz refresh rate makes the viewing experience really smooth especially as compared to 60hz in the previous phone.The sound quality is good, speakers produce enough loud sound and movies and videos can be watched easily.Overall, a very good experience so far."
1,"This is the fourth product(same mobile return and reordered multiple times) I received with dust on screen and backwards also seems the box kable is tampared.Today I tried contact Amazon from last 1hr but I am unable to do, it shows call cannot connected try again."
5,"I have used for 3 days. I love its blazing fast performance. Display is crispy & vivid color it is the main attraction. Camera is mindblowing. Nightmode feature surprised me. Gaming performance is also awesome. This phone has also Dolby sound system that amaze me. Both side has speaker so its produces 3d like sound. It has Bixby assistant. Google assistantand bixby assistant both are very accurate to capture my voice commands. Fingerprint sensor is also fast and accurate. Ui experience is so cool. I personally like samsung keyboard. This phone has AR zone app. You can play with augmented reality models. And much more.Only one cons - Battery life is average.Samsung is popular for their brand value, reliability and customer support.I will never blame my decision to chose between oneplus 9/9R and this phone. Finally I can say, I am fully satisfied with this phone."
1,"Highly disappointing for me as I bought Samsung S20 FE 5G phone on 6June 2021 and Camera was not working Manufacturing defect, I have visited the Samsung service center 4 time but unfortunately they did not fix the issue. When I mailed the case to samsung support they again asked to visit service center and assured me that this time they will fix the issue but post visiting the service center again the camera issue persist.Now I again raised the mail to samsung executive assign for my case they asked me to visit Samsung service center again, to fix the issue and even no one is replying to my mails now.This is how Samsung is irritating the customer with 0% customer satifaction with no resolution on Issues.Please don't buy Samsung Mobile and go for other brands like oneplusWorst  Products  from Samsung"
5,"I've made a switch from OnePlus 6 it was a good phone but I'm just in love with Samsung S20 fe .Looks & Display‚Ä¢The phone is gorgeous looking. At 190gms I was expecting it to be heavier & thicker but it was exact opposite. Weight distribution is good and phone feels very nice to hold.‚Ä¢Screen is very bright even at 800nits (unlike what youtubers had put as a con) and the display is very vibrant.Only prob is at 120Hz refresh rate the battery would tend to drain faster.Also, the Plastic back is prone to scratches.Battery@4500mAh it is sufficient to give an entire day even with heavy usage. As per my observations, With both 4G sims & using mobile data 1%of battery was giving an oncreen time of 8-12mins on 60Hz and 4-6mins on 120Hz refresh rate respectively.(Used mainly on internet surfing, media, chatting etc. But No Games!)So with 50% battery you can easily survive an entire day . üëçüëç(For mostly professionals doing mostly work related stuff)‚Ä¢15WCharger may be a mood spoiler for some but hear me out... I had OnePlus 6 prior to this phone and my op would charge from 10%-90% in 90 mins with the dash charger(0.89%perMin). This charger is 15watts only but it is well customised with the system. It takes slightly>1min to charge 1% battery and 54mins to charge 50% battery (0.92%perMin). While this can be slow compared to other phones, For me this isn't a problem specially when one charger has been provided, 25W support is there and battery backup is fairly good.As per my obsv., the faster the battery gets charged... The faster it drains too.‚Ä¢Also, tried charging via OnePlus's 30W4A dash charger.. to my surprise it was charging slower to than the 15w charger. Showed 20hr to full charge at 50% on the former.Camera‚Ä¢Front camera is below avg, particularly indoors & low light. Also the front camera struggles to lock autofocus. Outdoors it's okayish.‚Ä¢Back camera is very good.I was expecting it to have a better low life photography but No complains. But don't have very high expectations , it will give you decent results. Also during video recording touch responses are slow, the autofocus would by default lock itself to the brightest object, some random face or objects in motion & will continue that until either you stop recording or the subject moves out of frame. While this maybe very useful outdoors, indoors it may cause problems specially while using the phone with one hand.But overall the camera is very good.Performance‚Ä¢I got this phone yesterday and I swear I must've used it almost 8hrs non-stop (lum sum)During this time, I downloaded & installed a 700+Mb system update & 100s of personal apps and also updated 95% of them. Made calls, chatted, used camera, recorded 4k videos ... And I can very happily tell you so far the phone didn't heat. üòäDuring video recording & update installation made the phone feels warm but totally bearable.One UI‚Ä¢I'm completely in love with one ui. I'm making a swap from oxygen OS & just how light & easy to use is O-OS but one ui is no less.Very customisable, Very easy to Audit your Privacy.Goto to systems>Apps>Special Access and here you can control your battery optimisation, Files access, internet control & other features.Lots of features to explore.Also, for Music there's Samsung Music free on playstore and it doesn't have ads in it !!So far I haven't seen any sort of ad anywhere in the UI. üëçüëèCon‚Ä¢Newly inst apps & old apps are highlighted exactly similar, No difference.‚Ä¢Private Space in Op is very usable but not here.‚Ä¢Also one can easily rename apps as per their will in Op but not here.‚Ä¢Op has 3 finger screenshot vs palm swap on OneUi most stupid thing I saw here.‚Ä¢No internet speed indicator in notification bar, extra app would be required‚Ä¢No lockscreen gestures for torch, music player etc.‚Ä¢Alert slider was very useful in Op, missing here.Headphone jack‚Ä¢Well there's no headphone jack but also not every dongle would fit in it. There's a special Dongle that supports high ResAudio and costs around ‚Çπ600. Its better to purchase Bluetooth earphone. The audio is great.‚Ä¢Fingerprint sensor is avg. Fails 20% of time & is also slow. If by any chance your finger has smudge,dust, moist etc. fail % increases to 90. Keep that in mind.‚Ä¢Also, no physical proximity sensor has been provided. It's using some sort of gyro based sensor but it doesn't work at times. So there will numerous cases of auto screen On in pocket & fingerprint sensor getting blocked bcz of multiple faulty touches. Best way to deal this is either turn off ""Double tap to wake display"" or use flip cases.Delivery‚Ä¢Got this phone in less than 48hrs during Great Indian Festival sale. The delivery boy was also very polite & well behaved.üëçOverall, from Professionals perspective it is a very Decent & beautiful phone. You'll love this phone. Hope this review helps you .Edit 1-[10.oct.21]‚Ä¢Another solution to prevent faulty touches specially when in a sweaty pocket is to disable fingerprint touch. I've noticed the fp touch sensor gets activated by moist cloth gently pressed over it.Goto Biometrics and security > fingerprints> fingerprint unlock offThis will turn off fp sensor and should save battery too.You'll still need to turn off Double tap to wake too. (Only for desperate measures)‚Ä¢once you unbox the phone check for update, there should be a 700+mb update that may help with better battery management. Bcz, touch wood, minedoesn't heat at all.‚Ä¢people who need more performance, GotoBattery& device care >battery > Moresettings>enhanced processing OnThis should speed up things for you.‚Ä¢Camera needs time to get used to. Night mode photography is literally mind blowing but you'll have to learn a little bit of dslr stuff (eg shutter, iso etc) to get more out of Pro mode.I recorded 2mins of 4K,60fps and the phone didn't heat a bit ü§§üòá‚Ä¢phone gets warm upto 38¬∞on mere 15-20mins use of Hotspot."

1,"The product was gd although had some heating issues,was working fine .. one fine morning I found that it was not getting ON,I just had plugged it for charging few mins back n was working fine then.. Was so confused n had to force reboot .. I could hear all d notification sounds n incoming call alerts but my screen was completely dead... After force rebooting few times d display was on but went dead again in a matter of 2 mins... Have given for service n d authorised agent s saying of a hardware issue, n d part has to be replaced .. wat s d quality of a device tat u spent 40-50k if it fails with complaints within weeks of purchase... D only positive s tat d product service s covered under warranty as it was not caused bcoz of me .. it's too painful to wait for a week to get d device back after service n I m not even hopeful tat it won't occur back in future.. looks like I made a poor choice choosing a worthless device spending so much money just for d brand name samsung... There r much better options for better price than this... DONT EVER GO FOR THIS DEVICE... NOT WORTH IT.. if I hv an option to return this mobile I would happily give it back without hesitating for a single beat..."
5,"Can be a direct competition to iPhone 12 but at a much cheaper price as iPhone 12 128 GB costs ‚Çπ84,900 meanwhile Samsung S20 FE 5G costs ‚Çπ47,900. I binged watched YouTube videos about S20 FE 5G and comparisons with other phones such as the OnePlus 9 and iPhone 12. Also, this phone is MKBHD‚Äôs phone of the year for 2020.Software:- One UI is amazing and Samsung has promised 3 years of updates for this phone and have been regularly delivering on that promise by providing regular security updates since the last 6 months, according to my research through its reviews on YouTube. Regular updates haven‚Äôt been offered on OnePlus 9 as they tend to be half-baked and buggy updates since the last 2 years. Plus, additional Samsung features like Samsung Pay, Secure Photos, Samsung Dex, etc. are also very useful.- Samsung and Windows partnership has made it easy to use phone with your windows laptop. Works fine and is helpful. I guess it‚Äôs the closest it can get to iPhone Airdrop and sync feature with MacBook.- 60Hz and 120Hz works greats and keeps the phone smooth. iPhone 12 only has 60Hz but it runs as smooth due to its powerful Apple chip.Hardware:- Glass + plastic back which feels amazing to touch and doesn‚Äôt feel cheap to look or feel.- Great cameras which correct colour balance, and sharpness- much better than OnePlus 9. Videos are also sharp.- Mic and Front Facing stereo features are loud and clear. No call drops or cell tower problems on using Airtel and Vodafone. Dual sim works fine.- Includes a charger unlike iPhone 12.- IP68 water resistant and dust resistant rating which is missing on OnePlus 9.- Wireless charging and reverse charging works great to charge wireless earphones and wireless charging mobiles. Meanwhile wireless charging is missing on OnePlus 9.- Phone gets slightly hot when intense gaming is done on it. But it‚Äôs not unbearably hot and doesn‚Äôt throttle.- GeekyRanjit confirmed from Samsung that it has 9 bands of 5G as compared to Oppo or OnePlus phones in this range which only offer 2 or 3 bands of 5G hence this is more future ready for any 5G band that comes to India in the future.Battery Life:- With the in box charger, phone takes about 2 hours to charge from 0-100% and lasts all day depending on normal usage of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and some light gaming.Price:- While a 128 iPhone 12 costs ‚Çπ84,900, the same 128 GB Samsung S20 FE 5G variant costs lesser at ‚Çπ47,700 and also has additional micro-SD card slot which can expand the storage upto 1 TB. There is no such option on the iPhone.- Hybrid sim slot can be used with 1 sim + 1 SD card or with 2 sims instead.Final Verdict:It‚Äôs the best phone to get in this range. Has a balance of features - much more than a typical midrange phone and also gets some features from its flagship series S20. It also has a bigger battery than its elder brother - S20. It has all the features to make a good all rounder phone and should be able to last 3-4 years with regular updates and 9 5G bands making it more versatile to be compatible with all Indian 5G telecom providers whenever they launch 5G service in India."
5,"A good phone at this price point. The only drawbacks are charging (15w is way too slow, also fast charging is only displayed when u plug in the phone and later it charges the battery at a normal speed) and 3.5mm audio jack. Observed heating while playing cod but it's not that bad. Camera quality is good and gives you OK shots at night. Gives you 6-8 hrs screen time depending on the apps u r using & battery is k k .other than above exceptions everything looks good."
1,"Giving one star, because the option to select zero stars isn't available! So the phone's screen went blank (guessed a display issue?) the in second week itself. Amazon says they can't replace my phone and that I have contact the Samsung customer care. They too state they can't replace the phone. Two service centres in Mumbai couldn't figure out the issue, finally got to one of the largest service centres and the parts for the phone aren't available! Tried to contact customer care but received no response. They just dismiss you to handle your own dismay! Absolutely disappointed!! The phone is bad, the service centers are worse and the customer service is the worst!!!"
5,"After researching for months to replace my old workhorse MotoZ2force, I zeroed in samsung s20fe(exonys). But was vary of the processor.So when they launched the SD one I was Intrigued.However a price difference of 10k was something I didn't want to afford.So one day I got a 4000 rs coupon on Amazon so I bought it instantly.After cashback etc I got it for 41773, which is a steal. I would repeat, unless S21Fe is launched this phone is a steal anywhere under 45k.I lost my last phone due to water damage so IP68 protection was must which only A72 was offering.It also have many 5G bands but that should not be the reason to buy a phone at this time.The camera quality is good, see some samples.The image stabilization is great(see the moonshot.The sensor is not that great as my older motoz2force, but the software makes up for it.Also the 3x zoom lens comes handy in many situations.Display is great 120HZ is great but even 60hz(which automatically switches to 60hz in battery saver mode) is good and a normal user won't pick a difference.Fingerprints reader is great. In last 15 days I have not encountered any issues at all.I mainly use the face unlock which works most of the time.Finally, we Indians should start recognizing the value of software also and only the hardware specs. The UI is simple on one hand and highly customizable on the other.If you explore a bit then you can automate many tasks and increase the battery life also.Many people complain about only 15 watt charger in box. Well fast charging is good in many cases, but it reduces your battery life. And the 65 watt charging advertisement by chinese ones may see like wow but in a few months you will see how this fast charging reduces your battery backup and life. Call me old fashioned buy I am more than Ok with slow charging."
5,"Using this phone for more than a couple of weeks now. I was using Samsung Note series earlier, so naturally my expectations were very high and I must say that this phone has not disappointed me at all. I had gone through detailed reviews before purchase and the phone delivered what expected. After using it for sometime, below are my observations:1) The glastic build looks premium and good to hold in hand. But could be better with metal body / glass back.2) Weight of the phone is a bit on the higher side compare to the last note series phone I was using. It may be due to the bigger battery and bigger screen size. But really does not make much differences.3) In terms of capacity, the battery might not be the best one. But it is quite optimized with the processor and gives almost similar backup with higher battery capacity phones with lower processors. For me the battery lasts for around 1.5 days with moderate usage. Wireless charging and reverse wireless charging feature makes it different from others in the segment.4) Does not have FM radio and even I did not have it in my last note series phone as well. Probably the flagships do not have it. No difference for me, but of course it is a nice to have feature.5) No 3.5 mm jack. May be a concern but I think it is aligned with the vision of wireless accessories for flagships. If you need it, one can buy USB C-Type to 3.5 mm converter.6) For the flagship processor, performance is really smooth and fast. No heating at all.7) Supports 25 Watt fast charging but box contains 15 watt charger. This is a bit disappointing. With 15 Watt charger it takes around a couple of hours to get fully charged from ZERO.8) IP68 protection is really a flagship feature and it is the only phone in this segment to offer it.9) Hybrid 2nd SIM slot with up to 1TB memory card support is useful. But I would prefer a dedicated memory card slot.10) 5G support is not relevant for India as of now but can not do much with it since it is a standard offering nowadays with flagship processors in all the phones in this segment.11) India as Country of Origin probably get an extra thumbs up.12) Nothing to mention about camera. It is indeed one of the best without any gimmick of megapixels or extra lenses. It just optimum with best output. 8MP Telephoto lens makes it different.13) With additional 6K instant discount makes it absolutely value for money and even better than all competitor phones around it.What else you need? It is absolutely Value for Money and probably the best smartphone in this segment as of now."
1,I brought Samsung Galaxy S20 FE on Big Billion Day sale. It seems S20 FE seems to have worst wifi performance. After few minutes wifi speed drops to less then 10mbps. Even Coping files from Local NAS Server then speed is less then 10mbps. I have also Redmi K20 Pro. It never drops the speed below 250 mbps with NAS server. This issues seems to common across galaxy s20 series phones. Even more common for S20 FE made in India. Do a simple google search you will see lot of people complaining in reddit and XDA forum. I would advice against purchasing Samsung Galaxy S20 FE.
5,"Very good all round device from Samsung in this price bracket, bought it at just 42.5k during offer period.

4,"Everything ok but they make fool and cheated to prime member giving one day early access and charge extra 1000 in compaire to non prime member it cleare case of misleading to loyal prime members i will taken up this issue to consumer forum as they even not entertain customer concern, and this is not about money but what they promised is not delivered"
3,"All prime users who bought this product in early access, they had to pay extra 1000rs.Instead of getting festive discount. All prime users paid 1000rs extra to the seller. It is a kind of cheating for prime users.Also mobile has heating effect. It heat very soon. Battery backup is not upto the mark.Rest everything is good."
5,"Pros (exellent disply and its very smooth, and samsung UI is best, back camera is also very good), mobile is very slim and light weightCons.15 w charger takes exact 2 hours to get full chargedOverall phone in this price range 25k is best."
1,Good phone.But Amazon cheated prime customers by selling it at 26999 on 2nd October and selling at 25999 from 3rd. Customer care was even rude when asking the same. Never going to renew prime. Will be moving to Fkart.
4,I am a prime member so got early access to sale ie on 2nd Oct 2021(launch date). I bought samsung m52 at 26999 less 1000 coupon + 1500 hdfc discount. So I got it at 24500.Next day ie 3rd oct 2021 price reduced to 25999. My friend bought it at 25999 less 1000 coupon plus 1500 hdfc discount. So he got it at 23500.Never buy prime membership. They fool us . First we pay 999 for prime membership and get product costly then non prime members.Samsung m52 is very good phone.Display is good.Camera is cery good.I am not a gamer but tried some games like call od duty and worked good.Best part is phone is very light in weight.
3,Provided specifications are incorrectThere is no 3.5mm audio jack in device
1,"Have ordered on 02 Oct got delivered on 03 Oct 8 pm, by 10 pm it stopped working, no display"
3,Overall a decent phone. not having a fast charger 25W at this price is disappointing. Given the size of battery it would have been a great addition. Dont Believe the person in Mini TV claiming 25W is there is box. I bought this phone after seeing his review.
2,Amazon is not giving correct information about this phone.First: there is no 3.5mm audio jack as u hv mentioned in specsSecond: Phone is MADE IN VIETNAM and NOT MADE IN INDIA!!!you are fooling customers!!Also PRIME members are so privileged that you charged 1000 bucks more !!
1,Misleading information. There is no audio jack for this phone. We cannot use regular earphones. We should only use bluetooth headsets.
3,"Good mobile but 3.5 jack is not their as mentioned in the description and atleast samsung should give a soft case as this plastic back panel getting finger spot while using and now no back case available online or offline. Instead of 25w charger only 15w provided with box very big dissatisfied. Main thing All prime members who bought this product in early access Sale on 2nd Oct fooled like me, we had to paid extra 1000rs. Instead of getting festive discount. Next day non prime members got 1000 less amount for this mobile bad luck and learned not to act so earlier and I'm not going to renew my prime membership again. Thank you."
5,"Got it first by prime...smooth and slim, battery backup is also awesome. MUST BUY GUYS..The brand Samsung feeling is there. The only issue which I feel is Battery charging time..it took 1hr 30 min for full charge."
1,"Product description shows that there is a 3.5mm audio jack but there's not,only type c jack is available."
1,Likes - nothing as one can get same faulty features in other brands also.Dislikes -Screen heating is something  I have never experienced  before. Winter is coming so it might turns into Advantage.Also always put it in speaker during call as your ear is not used to this much coziness.  You can't plug earphones  even with OTG so speakers are the only option left.Battery charging  is so slow which gives you time to enjoy the things that really matters in life.
4,Also there is no backcase.
2,Good phone but not great.Display  üëç- excellent 6/5Camera - ok 3.5/5 (samsung GW3 main 64mp  sensor ) (samsung m51 has sony sensor)Audio.  - ok 3/5 (poco m2 pro audio is batter  then this )Look  - slim and light weight 4/5Charger - 15w  slow (output:9.0v~1.67A or 5.0v  ~2.0A)Plastic bulid but look and feel very goodNo 3.5mm earphone JacküëéNo FM radio ( i can't find ) üëéBettery isUsb type c to 3.5mm adapter not in boxCharging cable look like 50‚ÇπBattery capacity is 4860mah
1,Prime members are fooled!!!!ProsGood performance and displayConsCamera is not upto the mark. Poor image stabilization
5,A day spent on exploring my new device and I want to tell you it's amazing experience and it's my first samsung device. Now I am fan of Samsung galaxy's UI. Bit issues is there for me but overall it's gray. -> 8GB ram variantPrime customer paid 1000 more for 1 day early access. On 2nd October they sold 8gb variant at 28999 + 1000 discount coupon and on 3rd October it's 27999 + 1000 discount coupon!!!Pros.-- Ram management is great you can run lots of apps in background-- 120hz display felt like butter in thumb üëç-- 4K streaming on AMOLED displays is lit üî•.-- Due to fiber or plastic (IDK) body it's super light weight + no worries for backglass crack cause there's no glass but same shiny looks-- micro lens is amazing I had never seen in this price range range beforeCons- zoom in primary camera is decent (Not too bad but decent)- though it supports 25w charging only 15w adapter is in box and cable is USB to type c. Least type c to type c could be provided. So any one can buy 25w adapter.- no 3.5 mm audio jack!- very small charging cable
1,"It was advertised since ages that prime customers will get additional discounts in comparison to non prime customers. Like other prime members I bought this product in early access and bought it for 26,999/-. The very next day the price was dropped by Rs 1,000/-. I am a prime member from the last 4 years hence paid the membership fee and above all paid Rs 1,000 extra for the product. I have planned to not to renew my prime membership. This is a new way of cheating all together.Product is nice, battery gives about 36-40 hrs backup, has hybrid SIM slot and there is no 3.5mm jack."
4,"Overall it's a nice phone but there are few things which I felt missing -  25 Watt Fast Charger, 3.5 mm Audio Jack, In-Display Fingerprint Sensor and IP68 Rating."
1,Camera quality is very bad not worth buying at this cost of 26-27 k.  It's cost should be around 15k
5,"Ordered on 2nd Oct. Received on 3rd Oct/Aamzon delivery was pretty quick.Coming to phone description, super amoled display is top quality.Fast charing is pretty good, took me around 20 mins to charge from 52 percent to 100%.120 refresh is cherry on the cake which is buttery smooth.i didnt notice any heating while charging or using camera.This is initial impression, will post further details after 1 day of usage."
5,I didn‚Äôt expect this kind of slimness of the phoneAwesome great and smooth display supports hdr playback and 15w charger in the box
1,"Product  heat issue,  camera  is not good , speakers sound is too low , very slow charging ,battery drain very fast,overall Product  not cost effective, its cost should be 15k not 35k its not good deal."
1,"Just got the phone today and when I installed the applications i want, the phone gets heated very much. Also there is no headphone port which was totally shocking."
4,- Working  performances üëå  are  awesome..- Worth for money- Awesome  camera  and good pictures  quality.- Screen  quality  Awesome- 4K video  are playing  as mind blowing.- Battery backup more that 28 Hours .Cons.- They didn't  give Head phone. but in Amazon  configuration notes  head phone  included. I'm very disappointed.- Charger cable very small.
1,"Product is 1000k more in prime early access sale. When asked customer care about it, they came up with policies. So if you are non-prime and you buy this product, in effect you have 2k savings given that yearly prime is 999.Coming to the product, its good."
4,Phone is very slimDisplay is top notchBattery backup is goodLooks really goodUI is very cleanAmazon fooled prime customers for 1000rs....I want my 1000rs backNo fast chargerüò°
5,Fast delivery. Mobile is slim and looks good at the first sight.
1,Thankyou for making your prime members fool. I paid 1000 rs extra for prime and 1000 rs extra for mobile.Do not buy this phone. While playing bgmi you can see frame drop. No earphone jack. Built quality is not good. Heat too fast. Battery not good
3,"Early access was given to prime members but had to pay additional 1000 rupees which is not fair. Need to be extra careful next time before rushing to buy as a prime member. Can't trust now that the user gets the benefit of being a prime member. Otherwise, as a product, M52 5G is a good smartphone. I am using it for the last two days and no issues so far."
3,"All prime users who bought this product in early , they had paid extra 1000rs.Instead of getting festive discount and other Discount from bank . All prime users paid 1000rs extra to the seller. cheating  prime member bought on prime day .Battery backup is not upto the mark and Camera quality not good.worthless product  worth less for the price value with in 2 days price drop rs 1000, Cheating prime customers  also not accepting less rating then 1*"
1,Received damaged product. really disappointed.
1,Backwash phone no good phone cheap pro. Mediatek 720 screen TFT and battery charger  slow 15 watt only like 10000 phone ..nothing good..samsung very poor phone ..don't buy in 20000 ...TFT like 5000 phone display
5,Good 5G phone
5,"Bought it on the first day of launch. Delivered the next day. Very fast delivery by Amazon. Have been using it for last two days.Pros1. Phone has glass at the back which gives it a premium look. Feels stylish to carry it along.2. As usual, Samsung screen is smooth. Good picture clarity.3. Adaptive brightness 8s one of the best I've come across till date.4. Phone is very light.5. Camera quality is also very good. Front camera is also decent.6. Battery life is more than 24hrs for regular browsing over 24*7 wifi connection.7. Fingerprint sensor on right side is handy.Cons1. Charger is only 15 Watt. 25/30 Watt would have been better.2. Nothing else as of now.I feel good holding and using this Phone. If there is any chance then I'll update the review."
1,"Speakers are very very weak, produce very low sound, you will need headphone or speakers to listen music, I purchased it on first day and now they are just offering replacement which will not solve the purpose as every samsung M32 5G phone has this problem so I would recommend others to not waste their hard earned money in this phone as cost is too high compared to quality"
1,"Phone look is nice,Battery drain 65% after normal use 4 hours and 15 min.Camera is not as 48 mp if I compare my vivo phone 13 Mp is better than thisIf I talk about all over performance so phone is only good looking else nothing is in this device is goodPlz don't waste your money"
1,"I sold the phone sameday somehow on olx in 4k loss. Amazon doesn‚Äôt provide return.Phone is a joke.Plain M32 had full hd screen and now with 5G price has gone up by 6k and display is surprisingly half hd(HD+) . This is plain loot.Plastic is cheap.Camera is worst than any 10k phnSlow processorEven screen lags in scrolling, such bad refresh ratePathetic Processor and ramOverall its from 2012 times where HD+ was a thing. This phone is 9 yrs late.Never buy samsung in this segment."
3,They really need to work like motorola
1,Dislike- camera
4,"Received what I ordered.Received on time which is good, Thanks Amazon Team.Good Quality mobile from Samsung.Cheapest 5g ever with 12 band support.Purchased for my wife she is happy with phone.This worth and value for money üí∞ I would say.Sky Blue üîµ color looks premium!"
1,"After using one month I am writing this review,1. Galaxy M30s is better when compared to M32 5G, M30s has good battery capacity and camera quality,2. The camera quality is poor and the pixels.3. In this phone we can expect only 5G option that too we have to check after upgrading the sim.4. Regarding softwares I will post after updating the new software installation from Samsung,"
2,Over heat is produced while charging and when wattsapp messages receive and downloading. Spoke to customer care executive but they are not ready to take return
5,"Smooth touch, future ready with 5g, sleek design, expandable memory option upto 1 tb.First impression of the phone is good,when used phone continuously for over 2 hrs, videos and downloads and battery went from 50% to 25%, so i expect it to run for a day with full charge. Fast charge is also excellent, but not like other fast charges available in market. Its 1 min for 1% approxThere has been a issue with the M series of phones with UI not responding and system hangs, but this processor on m32 seems to be strong and they have I reckon resolved the issue (recommended not to use Samsung in build apps much as they consume lot of data and there is unnecessary lots of cashed data stored).Camera is OK, but they have lot of features like macro cam for close up night mode and have snap chat filters pre-added on camera which makes it fun and handy.Overall a perfect buy at this price range."
4,"Cons:1. Charger Adapter is only 15W Fast Charging unit. It takes  nearly 2 hours to get fully charged2. Charger wire length is less than 2 feet (comparatively less to the normal length of Charger wire )3. Fully charged phone will stand only 1 day if we use the phone at full level (use internet + calls ) through out the day.Pros:1. We can use secure folder option for securing confidential info/apps and data when we hand over the phone to some body either using finger print or pin or a pattern which is different from phone pattern.2. I got phone with RAM of 6 GB and installed several apps and used , phone doesn't show any slow down in speed.3. Finger print sensor at side switch on/off button seems to be attractive."
1,"Good phone till now except the finger print button location which accidentally pressed always when we are holding the phoneUpdate: reducing a starFacing glitches, not able to hear when I call to some body at first, if I keep try 2nd or 3rd time, then only I can hear.If it connect first then voice is not clear. Never faced any of these in my earlier realme phCharging time taking hell lot of time.Update: pls don't this phone, it's speaker is not clear, when I call its giving some disturbance not able hear the voice clearly"
1,"It's a worst mobile phone ever, Samsung proof that they are loos their credibility in India. This phone can not be worth more than  8k to 10 k. Camera is very poor, You can only use single Sim if you are using Micro SD card, Display is very poor , plz don't buy this phone. I think Samsung is going footprint of NOKIA ."
1,"The quality of camera, screen and performance or not at all good.camera quality is very very poor not even capturing photo like a phone of cost 3k. And the return policy of amazon was worst. Not a proper response by the executives of amazon. They are not accepting the return of this product, don't know the reason behind this. Dont  Why they are enecouranging sale of this product,  when they are getting similar problem form multiple customers.  Belief on amazon have worsening day by day.. literally disopinted with the amazon."
2,I personally  felt  display and front cam  ok ok but atleast rear cam for 23k 48mp its not good quality also. I am preferred to buy Samsung  but not this model
1,Dont buy this it is not worth for money. It is working slow
5,Pros:-1. Display (Best display you can get at this price i.e.  Super Amoled with 90Hz Refresh Rate2. üîã Battery (6000 mAh big battery)3. Camera ( 64 mp) and selfie (20 mp) and if you  know you know samsung image processing  software.4. Looks and back Design ( Awesome Pattern with  rainbow üåà reflection.)5. Compact Size (6.4inches) not too big and not  too small.......handy..Cons:-1. Processor (mediatek helio g80) which is a low  end processor and it might not affect your  overall performance if you are not a heavy  gamer or something like that.2. Infinity U display. Nowadays drop notch display  is kinda outdated look since overall look of the  phone is great but this small thing is like a black  spot on a white chart paper.##But Also keep that in Mind how can you get  everything in just 14999 -17999 ........in mid  range...these specs are perfect and at last you  can trust the brand name too.üòè
4,Cons:1.Good phone at this price.2.Display Quality is really great. Looks premium3.Camera is also very nice in daylight. In indoor it takes some shacky images.4. For Normal use I think it is best phone considering Samsung √Ämoled display and security.CONS:1. Could have been better if it comes with strong processor2. Samsung should have provided a Back case3. This phones support 25w charger but only 15w charger is provided so there must be 25w charger in the box
4,"I am sure there will be many reviewers who will do an in-depth analysis and list out the pros and cons of the device. So here i am pointing out the negatives that i felt . First thing first, the ring volume is mediocre. Ring is not at all loud and i wondee whether I have recieved a faulty device.Second thing i loathe is that, the back cover is a fingerprint magnet. Some kind of resin or composite material is used.To be honest, i didn't like the phone much. The design is outdated and sub par a 10k phone. Since bought this for an elderly person, the ring volume was a total bummer for me. Thats it, another useless review from me."
1,"I purchased this phone on 16999 from Amazon by exchange .but I did not find any quality as per this high price.1. Phone touchscreen is very slow and sometimes hangs stop working.2 while viewing YouTube the voice is not coming clear sometimes voice going up and down ,  microphone and speaker of this phone is not up to the mark even I should say worst. Of its kind.3 this phone is marketed as 6 gb ram but most of the phone memory is already approx 3 gb is occupied by pre-installed app which you can not remove. This is complete cheating with customer regarding storage.4.in whatsapp I am unable to select the more  photos. Its processor is very slow.even slower than  my previous phone .Do not waste the money on the premium phone like these.Better go for any other company"
1,"This phone is not different then other Samsung phone.  Yeh log but be cheater hai , kuch bhi change nhi . 31 ka 32 fir krenge 33 . Battery utni bilkul nhi jitna Shor mcha rhe hai. Service ek dam ghatiya. Pause Jeb me darkness ke baad uchi deewaar par Chad jaate hai. Please don't  buy Samsung Mobiles more. Ab ye vo people wali companies nhi rhi."
1,"Big major charging issue, charging icon is seen during charging but charging is not increased, that's a very bad or not exceptable by samsungConclusion- company target is money making not making a quality device üò°Now my money is loss and we are crying üò≠üíîüò¢"
1,"Believe me, it's the slowest mobile I saw. Don't go on screen and Battery, it is an extremely slow mobile phone and takes ages to open and navigate. Forget about heavy use, it can't handle normal regular use. I made a huge mistake but pls don't buy this mobile. It's only a few months and I am thinking to change it. Its dam SLOW SLOW SLOW."
1,"So greatful to Amazon for sending me such a nice product which has already landed in samsung service centre twice within one month of purchase, it was possible only when amazon refused to take back the product within the return period even though they've so called 'no questions asked' return policy.Above all Samsung did a great jod too by keeping the phone with themselves for 10 days now, sometimes I forget that I just bought a new phone because either it's not with me most of the times or it is sick.Lastly Amazon didn't even bother to reply back to my grievances.Hats off to you guys."
1,Samsung  is forcing the user to install all the junk applications  in our phone.even the Ota update installing the junks.Performce of the phone is pretty decent.Camera is also giving the good shots but the junk app spoiling the party.More than a samsung phone you are purchasing  bundle of junk applications
1,Worst camera. Seems like camera of local phone.  Returning this back.Too heavy. Don‚Äôt know why they are considering that 64 mp. Poor camera quality.
1,1. Heavy heat on both the sides. Front and back also.2. Charging is very slow.
1,Terrible phone. Always hang and unusable. Returning the product. Don't but this
5,"Processer is good.Both side Camera performance is good.Camera functions is work properly.In Screen look use face sacaner than fingerprint.Provide pre-installed apps Samsung system,  Microsoft system, Google system and Netflix's ,Amazon, etc.Charging capacity is too low, take 1¬Ω hr to charge.Fingerprint sacaner too small, many times its doesn't match.Lots of app pre-installed.25GB memory used out of 128."
3,"I'm a just a basic user of phones.  No movies, no games.  I mainly use phone, messages, photos, chats and other social apps and some utilities.  For the price, the features seem impressive and for my mild usage this phone sounds great.What I did not like is the amount of apps that were already installed on the phone!  Then I had to un-select a whole bunch of ""recommended"" apps during setup.  I was pre-subscribed to 'diagnostics' and 'recommendation' and 'marketing' notification by default!  Is that allowed?  Some features don't work unless I use specific apps.  Basically, they are app features and not phone features.  Sounds 'grey-area' to me.After spending half a day to go through all the settings and clean up the mess I think I'm ready to use this phone.  I still wonder what else I missed..."
1,Don't buy this mob... Camera performance is worse than 8k mob... Battery backup gives 1days.. On 60ghz..... 15k wasted.. No nfc...  Lost trust on Samsung.
5,My review after a week of usagepros-------*Battery - lasting for 2 days*Display - Great AMOLED display*Separate slot for memory card*Camera is also goodcons-------*Sometime touch is not working.*Battery - taking 3 hours to get fully charged. Nowadays we can get phone charged within 2 hours*Notification light is missing. Every time we need to on the button to check whether we have received any calls or messages*It is said that 15w charger but in adapter it says 10w (5.0 V = 2.0 A)*Too much of unwanted apps are pre-installed*Very outdated processor.
1,I am fully disappointed with this model.perfomance wise not good . Operating app is also slow taking so much time to open and download app .aslo taking so much time to charge after 40 % any mobile take 45 to 60 min to full charge but this mobile take around 90 to 120 min to charge.not worth it .not recommended to any one .
1,Battery Life is very poor .Even though it is 6000 mah battery it doesn't last a full day and needs to be charged atleast twice a dayEven though it is less than one month it's UI constantly stops and have to be closed.The response is extremely poor .I have been using One Plus 5 for the past 2 and half years and its response is better than this new device which is hanging and apps are crashing time and again .I had preferred an Indian phone to Chinese one but have been extremely disappointed with the performance of this phone
2,"I don't suggest to buy this m32 mobile, there is no extra features as they mentioned in their options, there they mentions atmos dolby sound, but third class sound in speakers and that option is not working, secondly palm swipe for screen shot is not working camera is so so, very bad product from samsung, I tried all the ways to take screen shots using palm swipe but I can't, if possible pls replace with another item mr amazon"
1,"This fraud incident happened to me. I bought Samsung Galaxy M32 smartphone on Friday 6th August 2021 online from Amazon and received it on Monday. As soon as I opened the This fraud incident happened to me. I bought Samsung Galaxy M32 smartphone on Friday 6th August 2021 online from Amazon and received it on Monday. As soon as I opened the parcel, I turned on the phone and found that it was defective.There is the issue of no display with this phone. The same day, I requested a replacement, the phone was to be replaced on 13th Aug 2021, delivery agent comes to my residence for replacement but refused to replace the faulty phone saying that the phone has no display and arguing that he requires to dial  *#06# on the defective phone to get  IMEI number for verification which he will feed on amazon's Software.But it is a well-known fact that on any cellular device like Smartphones IMEI no is printed on the phone, their box, and also on the receipt. I asked him to enter the IMEI number printed on the receipt but he refused. Again Iasked him to wait for few minutes and not to cancel the replacement I will talk to customer care to sort out this problem. But he did cancel the replacement. he might do it intentionally to grab the phonelater on Amazon Assured that the amount will be refunded, but to the date, no money has been transferred, i was contacted costumer care of Amazon  again on 13 August for pickup the defective cellphone samsung M32 ,on 14th August agent comes to my residenti and he also refuse to collect , makeing same excuse that you cell phone was ded so that's why I am not able to collect ....So dear those wo are going to buy any products  from Amazon be aware that Amazon team in india is making a Big Scam with their courier agent ...Please be safe and aware don't buy any product form Amazon .Dear readers. If you want to buy any products online use another online cart , like flipkart , Mintra, Mishu , but never from Amazon boycott Amazon ..."
5,"Amazing phone. I would rank it the best overall phone experience. The pros are obviously known to everyone, the 90hz display is great. The touch feel is literally like butter. Cameras are great. Amazon prime runs in HD so widewine l1 is there. Speakers are loud, not tinny but lack bass. Can't complain.Phone requires careful first time setup to avoid ads as suggested by ranjit sir. No ads encountered yet. Everything works well, side mounted power button /finger print reader is fast and accurate. Light sensor, proximity sensor are flawless. These 2 are typically bad in Chinese phones (mi note 5 pro user) causing display to turn on when in call, so thumbs up.The cons: the processor seemed weak on paper, but the experience is great. Not that I am defending samsung, but a compromise 90% can blindly make. I do not play games, so can't say much but better processor phones out there. This is for general public who wants smooth experience of samsung phone and no software bugs.Some complained of emmc5 storage, but apps installed damn fast and I did not find and sluggish read write speed issue. Fast and phone did not heat during setup process when installing 100s of apps and no slowness observed. I have 2 m30s in house, they also pointed out better build quality, better looks of my black version and fluidity of screen. Good for light gaming. Go ahead with the phone for good vibes throughout phones life. Now samsung is giving 3 years of software updates, so great."
1,"Display is good and bright. Battery  average. It's not that speed being 6gb ram, while making  call it lags. Camera not upto mark, I miss grand camera which was better  than 64 mp. Over priced, don't have basic features  of other M series phone. On the name of brand Samsung started cheating people.  They should  atleast  provide  cover."
3,"After purchasing Samsung M12, was looking forward to getting M31, but the mobile was not available and the prices increased. After waiting for a month, saw that M32 is available so purchased it but not entirely happy with it. The phone rings on its own at times, chimes continuously other times without any call or notification being given. Phone lags at time and opening apps also takes time. Perhaps the 6gb variant is better but I have 4gb model. OneUI was supposed to be stable and I am quite disappointed with this particular purchase at least."
1,"This is my first review of Any product purchsed online. I'm shopping online since ages now. But this Phone FORCED me to write a review.I've been Using Asus Zenfone phones till date for my usage, Had a wonderful experience....First time ever shifted to Samsung just because of so called Brand Name.WORST DECISION.Camera OK.Battery OK.Performance OK.Screen OK.Brightness OK.Within 1 week Lock switch stopped working.I'm locking and unlocking by screen tap option because samsung people have said it'll take time to repair.Body completely cheap plastic material.Heats up with normal usage.When in pocket automatically wakes up and starts typing numbers or dials emergency number.With No disregard to Samsung I'm saying very bad phone you've made.Very overpriced. Should be of 9k or less.Others opinions may differ from me. This is just my personal experience.I'm sorry to give you less stars Samsung but please improve your quality not quantity. There is no mandate to launch new phone every week."
4,Pros: Screen resolution is good. Speed and performance is ok ok. Sometimes got little sluggy during parallel execution. Camera is very good quality. Battery life is good. SW is really smooth. Speaker is louder enough. Finally it's not a Chinese brand.Cons: No 4k or HDR video viewing. So some videos are blurry even though it is HD. During charging phone gets heated up. Tats may be it has bigger battery. 5G support is not Der since most phones are now with 5G. Price might have been little less to compete Chinese brands.

1,Camera quality not good and battery backup very bad.üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†
2,"Best camera quality at 15k Not for gamers only for simple multimedia use and want a secure phone. Yes it lags too much on normal and heavy use .No carrier aggregation by samsung prosser support carrier aggregation only 3 thing is good about this phone camera,display and battery"
5,"Using since last three days ...completely satisfied with everything. In this segment so many phones are available but if i get the SAMSUNG then why i should go anywhere else...Pros:Display - SAMOLED with Full HD, Side Curves make you feel so happy. Brightness is awesome.Sound - Dolby Sound is also good specially with wired headphone.Battery - Without internet 2 days do not worry to charge it and with internet one full day.Call Quality : Also goodVideo Calling - BestCamera : Picture is so goodProcessor - Fast as it comes with 90Hz refresh rate.Cons:Notification LED Indicator is missing but can be managed.RAM could be 8 GB but if you choose the quality then it can be also ignored. 6GB also working fine.Verdict: If you are not a GAMER then blindly you can grab it."
5,"Value for money and best is 90hz super amoled display and 64mp quad camera. Best for listening music and watching videos as it has 6000mah battery goes 1+1/2 day ""but this phone is not for gaming"""
4,"best Non-Chinese smartphone preference under 15K | Excellent battery | Decent Camera | Smooth | Stylish look | Mummy Loved it ( I gifted it to her)Not made for chhapri youth icons of India.Not the best camera phone under 15K.for gaming under 15k > Motorola G40 / POCO is better option.if you are a decent user, who loves to watch videos/ browse social apps then definitely go for this.for Mumma/PAPA this would be best choice rather than Chinese smartphones.(Thumbs UP) BATTERY : Screen On Time > More than 13H for Mumma. she watches Jio Tv & browse social apps quite often.(Processor) MTK G80 doesn't lag much as compare to Exynos processors + it is better optimized for battery consumption. example Samsung M21 2021 with same 6k mAh battery with Exynos processor gives 7-9h Screen on time only, while Samsung m32 with same 6K mAh battery with MTK Processor gives more than 10-12H screen on time."
2,Waste of money. Don't but this phone. I'll not recommend it to anyone. Today I received  this and within 24 hours am reviewing  the product.  It's not worth . Camera is bad. MI is much much much better. I shud have listed to other reviews  before buying this.
2,"Seeing few YouTube videos,I purchase it,  It's 7-Days now.Processor is G80 , Which Don't support 90Hz& Don't support 2k Videos & Pics.,But, People who use for minimum usage like 2-3hr YouTube,  Amazon videos good.Most time it's 60hz , so, u feels Videos üìπlag ,When u take FHD pic it takes 2-4sec to save it.I am feeling M40 which I got 3-years back is much faster..So, Always go with Snapdragon processor.."
5,"The youtuber reviews will tell you that this phone doesn't have a powerful processor that others will offer you at this price range. It is a fantastic mobile for an average user like me. You should have to look what your purpose of the mobile you want purchase. If you want to play games like pubg and you want professional video/photoshoot this phone is not definitely not for you. It is good to watch youtube videos at high quality with samsung's amazing samoled screen, it can take some good photos and videos and can do some games even pubg at minimal settings.I thing like this people who drive  vehicle at a speed of 60 k.m per hour wants a car that have very powerful engine and they will never need that much power. Like that I don't need a very high performing processor and other features that I may not use.So think, if you are a person who only wants to use mobile for to make and take call and watch videos and occasionally wants to play some game, then this mobile is definitely for you.My job is some what risky and I need automatic call recorder to deal with my risky customers. This mobile has that feature. Its my purpose and that's why I bought this phone.Its a good phone an average customer."
5,"In love with this beast in reasonable price, camera quality is really great, screen resolution is far far clear and colour full, battery is strong, light weight, compact size, all required smart phone features are build in the phone. Good job Samsung team."
1,Do not buy. There are plenty of other good options for the price. Main issue is the PROCESSOR.  I just felt it's too slow compared to  the mobiles available.  Phone is also bit thick . And I think its manufacturing is stoped too.  It's only sold online. If I had a chance I would buy a different phone .
4,"Don't waste money on redmi or realme jst in sake for money. This phone is very nice for decent users. It is an all-rounder in all tasks, but for decemt usage. Camera is very nice than redmi, realme, oppo etc. Notch is very small and does not disturb. One UI 3.1 has tons of features to customize. My rating 8.5/10.All the Best!"
5,Great product. Bought it for display and battery.Cons...Processor is not powerful enough to draw 90hz. Battery is also drained so fast while use 90hz refresh rate.So I switched back to 60Hz. Performance improved and battery lasts longer than before.
1,"I am not happy buy the mobile in amazon.Whats in the box:- Handset, Earphone, USB Cable, Sim Tray Ejecter, Pre-applied Screen Protector and Protective Case, Booklet with Warranty Card and Quick Guide"

2,"It's an average phone. Quite on the pretty side. ONLY those who are looking for a budget phone can think of purchasing this one. The camera is very average, but the functions & controls of the phone are smooth. It's very lightweight - that's a plus!"
5,Its a really very amazing and a nicely working phone..the camera quality and battery is also very goodü§©üòä.liked the product very much
1,Worst mobile . I never expect from oppo such a low grade mobile. Touch is not working. Phone hanging. No return and replacement option.  From Amazon I got bad experience. Don't buy this mobile. Waste of money.
1,It is roadside product with dusty display. When called Amazon customer care she deny to replace item. Don't buy anything from Amazon. Amazon only sells defective items. I returned many items and this was very useless response. She also disconnected call.USELESS AMAZON
1,"when i ordered this phone , headphone is free with phone but received order without headphone"
4,Nice phone value for money but in inbox there is no earphone and screen protector receive being a regular customer of Amazon i am  unhappy there was  clearly written that these items are included in inbox.
1,"Body sensor not working. Was late by 2 days to find out this defect and so could not use ""return"" option.Due to body sensor problem, phone display never gets off while talking and so when brought close to ear, buttons like mute, hold gets activated while speaking.The basic function, which is to talk to others on phone becomes troublesome. Everytime have to very careful of holding position to make sure phone is not touched on body. Hate this and feel cheated/dejected.Cannot return as well."
5,"Nice mobile prices 12,450"
3,i have recently bought this phone..on 18 may 2020.. delivery is good but there was no headphones in a box.features r awesome nd phone is working gud.but camera quality is bit bad.
1,This mobile was used by someone else.I have got someone else's mobile.I am not happy for this mobile.I will not do return this mobile.Because the reason of I give gift for other person.
5,"Oppo always exports premium quality mobiles. Let there be no such features like other mobile but i phone also doesn't export such features at high price, then?I have attached some pictures also you can check them incase you wanna see the picture quality.Hence you can buy this without any tension.Amazing mobile's camera and body quality and display is also good.Go for it I suggest. üòÉ"
1,This product received wrost.. In this item some useful applications not run..Order canceled but no cancelation status and pick up status updating by Amazon..No any contact provided by Amazon..Realy disappoint..
4,"Better to value for money , quality is as per shown ..And fast delivered by amazon."
1,Don't buy it from Amazon the return service of Amazon is very bad..disgusting they never think customer problem no one in call centre never call you return policy and service is very poor only benefit looking cite ... don't buy anything from amazon.. in future I never buy electronics items from Amazon... flipcart is most trusted than amazon
1,Earphones not received in a phone box
1,The phone lags a lot right from the box. You have to swipe 3-4 times. Apps get hung. Never seen such a pathetic phone.
2,This product details said there is a earphone and screen protector.  But i didnt get that
5,The phone is excellent but if the front and rear camara should be high and should be their dark mode compalsary but it should be added fastly and should give ear phonesonly main default is not nice camara should be high because the less cost mobiles will take more tean agers so they do moor selfies so it should increase and oppo is the selfie expert but this phone no selfie expert camara for next phone it should increase .Imay think I will increase
1,"1. Phone don't have type C charging2. Dual app not possible for all app like redmi phones3. Charger is normal 5v 2 Amp so no fast charging.4. Not for multi tasking people.5.

It will open link every times in default browser..Eg: if I got any Facebook /insta /Twitter link and I already have installed these app then it will not asking me to get open with app instead it will redirect to browser and again I need to login... So so poor technology1.processor looks slow while setup and configuration my account data restoration as compare to redmi note 7 (same price older version phone than this)2. Camera quality is very low both back and front ...capture blurred images..not focusing the face even after setup manually.3.  Not value for money.. I think I made mistake to choose oppo brand .. I compare all the feature with redmi.. redmi looks far better than this..4. No front flash light available to click in night5. Looks slow to handle multiple apps compare to redmi6.

1,I purchased this phone in Feb. 2020  from Amazon site and now it's May 2020 and  I find it difficult to swipe it open after the display goes on sleep mode.  So this is the status it's touch mechanism within 3 months.  So one has to be careful about buying cheap quality Redmi phones as the touch mechanism may not be of good quality..
5,"Camera: Good Quality. In good light, the pictures are awesome.Battery: No doubt, awesome backup.Display: Smooth and colors look better than similar range phones.Screen: No tempered is compulsory.

1,Service is good but........
4,"I bought this phone for my dad.Pros:good battery lifelarge screenlook and feel is nicecamera is good for its priceCons:THIS HANDSET IS MADE IN CHINAI thought it is Redmi (made in India), but it is made by Xiomi.Does not have fingerprint scanner."
3,Cons: No fingerprint sensor.No Widevine L1 support.Not a good camera at all. Photos captured are blurry and unclear. Totally disappointed with the camera.Too many MI built in apps which reduces the usable memory in hand.Pros: Premium quality design.Feels good in hand.Corning Gorilla Glass 5.Type C port.Fast charging.Dedicated Memory Card slot expandable upto 512 GB.Super Class Audio Speakers. Sound is very good. Listening music is very much enjoyable.Not heating up while charging.Display not bad at all.All in all a good phone at this price range.
3,"Cons:1. Very bad camera. Selfie camera is not even enough for video calling.2. Performance is not up to mark with 3gb RAM.3. Heating problem with extensive usage of internet or gaming.4. Many unnecessary apps which cannot be removed are impacting performance.Pros:1. Very good battery life.2. Nice display and well built.3. Budget phone.Overall, it is a budget smartphone with less smartness. Lot of notifications which are unable to remove with many unnecessary apps in OS."
1,"Not a good product. Took it to service center. First they changed software. But again started to hang. Requested for replacement, but not getting replacement during warranty. I purchased this because of its high rating and it looks amazon rating is fake."
4,Missing fingerprint sensor but nice phone with nice design
5,Thanks Amazon for delivering the product as mentioned in the product description. It was well packed and delivered.
4,"The phone comes with a 6.22-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720x1520 pixels and an aspect ratio of 19:9. The Redmi 8A Dual runs Android 9.0 and is powered by a 5000mAh battery.The phone is a bit heavier though compare to the other ones. And sometimes it gets over heated.Overall, it's an affordable phone with a very reasonable amount of money."
4,"First  of  all I would like to say,""IT IS THE BEST PHONE UNDER ‚Çπ10,000""....*GOOD Selfie and Rear cameras at this price.*FAST CHARGING*GOOD PERFORMANCE*STYLISH EXTERNAL DESIGNS*BEST SPEAKERS*BEST FOR PLAYING GAMES LIKE FREEFIRE ,PUBG etc...(but You should play with Standard Graphics otherwise occurs a heating issue )*NO FINGERPRINT FACILITY*NO EARPHONES AVAILABLE WITH THE PHONE*PREVENT THE DEVICE FROM RUNNING IN LOW SPACE other wise There will be a Lag iSsue.."
1,"This phone has two major issues, overHeating issue, and a network issue. Display, Camera and build quality good.Overall not happy with the product due to heating issue and network issue. Heating issue irritates lot. Unable to use phone more then 30min."
5,"A phone with amazing Value to Money. There is just one point which is that it's a 4g phone but if you are the one who will change the phone 1.5 or 2 years then this phone will be very efficient for You. Camera saturates the colour slightly but that's always a little problem with the Samsung camera used here, but overall the details are good. The multimedia experience is great with Dual stereo speakers and a 120 Hz sAmoled Display. Battery is also amazing.One thing is Sure that your money will not be wasted if You buy this phone."
5,It performs good. Design is awesome. Camera quality is also good. It also charges quickly.The amoled display is the main highlight it performs marvelous. Best device at this price point.
5,"Update: guys you can purchase this handset as all issues has been fixed by update..Bro listen carefully after 14 days of usage I'm editing my review from 5 star to 1 star because Xiaomi really failed in their software dept.... Phone gets warm without usage or in use!! if you use normal myntra, paytm kind of app, phone gets warm... And after recent 12.0.8 update phone battery draining fast, that means xiaomi is great messing their new devices, they will ruin every device by providing buggy update!! Last but not the least is ""DISPLAY FLICKER"" issue... yes this is kind of a annoying thing which every users are facing including me.... and this is sad!!Verdict : So if you are planning to buy this handset, think twice before buying!"
5,"to be honest the phone is very great in terms of spec sheet everything is great1.Display:no doubt on display blacks are pure black colors are so crispy plus 120hz super Amoled aahhh! and the front camera notch is actually very small barely noticeable2.UI:MIUI is laggy but I think an update will be pushed and with miui 12.5 its gonna be super awesome and its feature-rich3.Battery:5000mah can easily last for 1-2 days depending upon your use if you just use insta or Whatsapp or youtube don't worry you don't even need to look at that 33w charger and charger is not that fast but yeah 1hr 15mins for a full charge is ok for me4. camera:in day time its good with stock cam and if installed the GCAM then its definitely gonna surprise you and the rest all reviews you can look up on youtube not directly talking about night mode I have added a sample and I myself was stunned no grains and that too this click is from the stock camera and gcam makes it almost like a 6 pm evening click5.good in terms of connectivity its 4g, not 5g and I don't think 5g will come that soon easily useable6.last phone I had was redmi 3 and its definitely a huge upgrade for me but comparing and doing a lot of research and buying this product within the budget was my best decisionjust got yesterday and was testing will do some more digging and update!"
4,First of all if you are a heavy user and use clones of different apps then please skip this series.. Even redmi note8 was better in handling hundreds of clones but this is lagging just after 10 clones even though it's having 732g comaoring to note8 sd665Pros:-1) s. Amoled display with 120hz refresh rate.. Display is awsome2) phone is slim comaparing to other redmi phones and in hand feel is awsome and rich feel can be seen3) the frost glass back looks superb4) front camera is awsome back camera is avgCons:-1) Phone is not performing acc. To it's specs and it's a major drawback2) the micro lens are wosre comparing to note10 micro lens.. I dunno I got defective or every pro mobile user facing it3) battery charging time taking longer than it's shown4) camera bump... Comparing to note10 it's having huge camera bump and it's looking ugly for the beautiful back5) with 120hz refresh rate the baterry would drain super fast if u are a heavy user.. U can settle it by changing the refresh rate6) stereo speakers are not that much loud as expectedIf you are a normal user who doesn't play games like pung then surely go for this but if you are a heavy user then go with poco x3 pro which is a sure shot killer at its price range
4,"actually i bought this smartphone on 10th april from amazon and the model which i got has touch issues and i replaced the product and i received another one on 14th april but the model is worse than the previous one it has flickering issuse with some gamma problem in which we see light bleeds on black pictures while watching video and i had chromatic abbrevation problem in display contacted mi and amazon several times it makes me really frustrated so i just gonna get refund for this  device and gonna buy another phone ,be careful while purchasing this product it has sooo many display issues!!!!after 1 month usageok now im updating my review, actually i bought redmi note 10 pro once again and that too had the touch issue but after updating my phone to miui 12.5 almost all the bugs got fixed the screen is really good and bright even mi optimized software such that now i  have smooth experience but sometimes battery drain even though the screen is off but clearing data of miui biometrical will resolve the issue ,more and more updates making the phone really awesome great audio in stereo speakers and charging is pretty slow when the temperature is above 35 degree ,In cool environment phone charges within 1 hour, nice phone under this budget segment"
5,Excellent in this price range ü§© Superb mobile and the display is just awesome or touch response is excellent. Battery consumption is very good as per mobile specification. I don't know now any idea about camera so I don't rewiew that. Very interesting thing is very small punch hole front camera.
1,Heats a LOT! even with general usage :(
1,"Overheating, slow charging and display blinking."
3,"Awesome Mobile.Do not take seriously about the negative reviews, yes, there are few problems but as a normal user you wouldn't notice them.But all the pros will definitely make your device special. Just go for it.Edit:- **After 1 month usage(almost) **Pros:- Haptic Feedback is awesome, you will love typing messages  Display is best, 120hz is loveCons:- There are always mixed notifications, and they don't appear properly due to miui optimisation. If anyone whatsapp you and you ignore it, someone new message you after that, you will always the message which you wanted to ignore. New message will never show.  Back camera captures oversaturated photos. Front camera captures too much reddish selfies.  Lags often. Notification panel always comes down after second try.  Brightness is low in auto brightness mode. You have to increase it on your own.  There are too many places where you are asked to give permission to send data. If you send data, there will be too much ads. And believe me, if you sign in miui account, you have to format your phone to avoid facing adds.  If you take screenshot in dark mode, the screenshot is also dark. You have to take screenshot in normal mode. Also pdf viewer shows pdf dark in dark mode. Use wps office or drive pdf viewer.  Many apps which need to run in background won't work easily because of miui optimisation. So, you will miss many whatsapp and Facebook notifications many times. You have to keep checking your phone after a period of time.  THESE ARE ALL THE PROS AND CONS I FACES DURING THE USAGE OF 30 DAYS. HONESTLY, THESE ARE NOT MAJOR PROBLEMS BUT I PERSONALLY FIND THEM A LITTLE IRRITATING. THANK YOU."
4,"I have congratulated myself as I got this mobile in the 1st flash sale but it is very short lived. All the crucial aspects such as Screen Quality, smoothness, Battery life , call quality  & non heating of processor are very good. The only problem that this phone has the proximity sensor. The proximity sensor is very erratic and stop responding during an active call making the light of the screen off and we are not able to either end the call or to access any menu functions. Having loved this phone's build quality very hesitant to return this phone. As the issue of proximity sensor is compounded as time passes by , I have requested for replacement. I got another new phone as replacement and that one is also having proximity sensor problem. Therefore, I have returned the 2nd phone and got the refund. Kudos for Amazon's hassle free return policy , transparency and great service."
3,"Two days of usage and hating MIUI - not optimized at all. Issues with proximity sensor are prominent. Fingerprint sensor works 8/10 times. Camera quality looks good only under good lighting conditions. Basic theming options available in Android 11 are not present (MIUI problem). To top it all, screen flickering with dark theme is rampant, making the experience a lot to desire for."
5,Excellent Display with Amoled and 120 Hz. It supports HDR contents in Netflix and YouTubePerfect build and design : It comes with Gorilla glass 5 protection on front and frosted glass back with slim body gives very premium inhand feelStereo speaker: After 12.5.4 update it supports Dolby atmos and it is awesome It had bugs in UI when I got it. After 2 updates everything was solved and it very smooth nowCamera is average for me. There are lot of features.Battery life: i get around 8-9 hours of sot with 1 hour of BGMIGaming : It Very good in this price range. Can play smooth + extreme in BGMIConsIt take 1:40 hours to fully charge.It is advertised that it'll charge 59% in 30 minutes but in reality it have 1 hour for that.Proximity sensor issue while playing Whatsapp audio
5,"Hi, I am using this phone after using oneplus 7t. Overall my experience with phone is as expected so giving 5 start.There is almost everything good with phones, below are the points which I have noticed:1.  Always on display is only for 10sec by default. I have enable real AOD by disable MIUI optimization in developers option.2. I am having 300Mbps broadband and get around ~ 280Mbps on my laptop but on this phone i get round ~200Mbps.3. Sometimes in YouTube video resolution shows 480p max.4. Google chrome app does not get updated. I have tried by clearing app data & cache, still it is not getting updated. We can't uninstall chrome on this phone.5. There will be lot of glitches and frame drop issues at 120Hz. On 90Hz it is working fine.6. Charging speed is not that good. I was playing COD on normal graphics for 45min with charger connected it charged from 17% to 19% in 45 mins.7. Phone gets little warm, i thing it is ok.8. Dark mode for 3rd party apps is not that good.9. Speaker quality is good. No issue with Bluetooth and mobile signals.10. Don't is any ads till now which is good thing.11. Lot of customization can be done which is good but phone gets slow later.Above may get change after long term usage.Overall, this is THE phone you should buy till 17k."
1,"Pathetic network reception, Pathetic Mic that you end up using Loudspeaker in all calls!Make sure you check within 1 week of the replacement window and RETURN, else be ready to waste your money like me"
5,"Been using it for 2 days and here is what i thinkDisplay is best in this price range and 120 hz smootness is really impressive.Battery life is good you can easily get 7 hours plus even on 120 hz. Charging takes around 1 hour and 30 minutes. But one problem is that it chrages slow when the temperature is above 35 degree celciuous, belowe that it is fast.Camera takes good pictures in daylight and somewhat okay pictures at night. Super macro lens is also actually good this time. But one thing regarding the wide angle camera is that colour tone of pictures taken with wide angle is not same as that of main sensor.Streo speakers are awesome and the backside does not vibrate that muchPerformance is exactly what you can expect form a midranger. No lags in doing day to day activities and gaming is smooth in medium graphics . it does get warm while gaming but not overheating.Overall a really good product from Xiaomi."
3,"Quality:Build Quality of the phone is good.Screen quality is good for media viewing.Camera:Camera is good for this price range.Regular Use:It's designed for regular use only.Gaming:I played Call of duty, it allows only high frames in medium settings. Not snappy, phone lagging alot.For gaming enthusiasts, I don't recommend this phone.Bugs:Audio bugs found....when put on speaker...I found echo problem in both Airtel, Jio and Wifi.MIUI visual bugs, need lot of tweaks for better performance. Switching between apps found slow.Overall:Ok for Normal users, not for medium to heavy lifters.Flash sale is gimmick, noting for hype here. Wait for it for discounted price."
1,"After 21 days of use here is my honest review...1. Major flickering issue when you run your mobile at 120ghz2. Big network or calling issue, Sometimes the otherside person in mobile is unable to hear my voice, i have to reboot every time, had confirm with my network operator they is no issues in area and they are right because i never had such issue with previous mobiles3. Heat issueI will not recommend this phone for you as it has major basic issues, which Redmi team has not RND on it, pathetic"
5,Feels so good to use!
2,"Worst amazon service, and im using redmi phones from last 4 years but this time totally disgusting and time wasting purchase on amazon firstly the flash sale(terrible) second i replaced my handset coz the handset touch(right corner) isn't working properly touch issues. But the replaced one's pre applied scratch guard is not applied properly i removed it. By the one day of usage of replaced one im not having any issue. Lets see how it goes till"
4,"I've been using this for two days now. Got it delivered yesterday morning. Setting up everything was easy, the phone accepted Sim Cards without issues. Transferring all of my data over from the previous phone took a couple hours.Finally after that, I started testing what my phone could do. With a 6GB Ram and 128GB Memory there is a lot to do. All of my games run rally fast, there are no issues with heating so far even after using the phone for hours and hours.The battery is insane. Just Charging it up to 95% and leaving it will let it last for a couple days easily. Even playing games and watching a movie for a couple hours would barely take 10% of the battery.The Camera is extremely good. I'm not a huge camera buff but compared to my previous phone (Lenovo Zuk Z2 Plus) this is absolutely absurdly good.The apps run seamlessly without issues. And there is a lot more to discover.I think at Rs. 17000, this is one of the best possible phones anyone can get right now. It's definitely worth buying."
4,"Worst phone iam a real me user. The performance is not good as I expect if you are a gamer please don, t buy these mobile because these mobile gets heats after 20 min of gaming and gets lag while playing but it can handle some small games if you spend more time in watching videos then this mobile will satisfy your needs because of amoled display 120hz is not up to date mobile takes 1hrs 50 min to get full charge. The charging is very slow and battery backup is also very bad on this price segment good mobiles there so go for that iam not faced screen fickering issues camera is ok for me but over saturation iam totally unsatisfied with these mobile"
1,"i bought this phone by seeing the overall specs (ie, 120hz super amoled display, 5000mah battery, stereo speakers, etc...) but this has some issues__________________________________________cons__________________________________________1. the mic quality is very bad. during normal calls, the mic quality is somewhat ok but during video calls the opposite person cannot hear me properly ( If you are using this phone to speak to a person via video call you will get disappointed)2. battery is draining very fast when compared to other mid range phones ( after heavy use, needs charging in afternoon)3. proximity sensor issue ( very irritating when call gets hanged up automatically)"
1,"I bought this phone on 7th April, and ghifted to my sister. It was working good enough, there is some minor problem, but it's acceptable. But on 16/5/21 while my sister using the phone it's suddenly turned off and it's completely off like a dead phone, I didnt know what to do, I have called Amazon customer care and told them about this issue but they said I have to go to service center but from coming morning it's lockdown so no service will be available. I called Xiaomi service center and told them about the issue even the also told me to visit service center, bt from Tomorrow It's lockdown, So I have to wait till lockdown is ends. But seriously Phone is an essential item, atleast service should be opened.I don't live with my sister, I am having so much trouble to contact my sister. At present Redmi Note 10 pro is completely useless and dead phone, Xiaomi should look into this type of issue. She didnt do anything, just browsing and it's suddenly turned off. I hate xiaomi after this incident. I won't buy any xiaomi product from now on."
5,Thanks Darshita etel for delivering such a awesome product .Omg the bronze color is simply awesome üî•üî•üéäüéäüî•üòÑGuys pls just blindly go for this phone.Beats all flagships which are overpriced and hyped like OnePlus.üòÇüòÇStereo dual speakers are simply mind blowing.Camera not too bad.Amoled just like Samsung flagships üòÇ
5,"Since my OnePlus 7 conked off out of nowhere one fine day, I was forced to scout for a new phone on a very short term basis. Because of this, I had to move from a phone in the budget premium segment to a higher trim phone within the midrange segment. I will be writing this review from this perspective. I have been using this phone as my main device since the 4th of July, and I've written this review after using this phone for a little under two weeks.One of the biggest things that got my eye was the beautiful Samsung AMOLED display. It is on par with, if not better than my older OnePlus 7. The blacks are beautiful and I could tell that MI did not skimp out on this segment. However, I do feel that their touch sensor could use some improvement, as I find myself mistouching a lot of buttons on it. Also, the screen tends to have a significant flashing problem, especially during the night. While I don't think this is a very frequent issue, do keep this in mind when making a purchase. Another great thing about the screen is the refresh rate. While 120 Hz does make a noticeable difference to the speed at which images and frames move, over time it didn't feel too prominent. Also, most websites do not have the silky smooth scrolling, thus, making it feel a bit alienating. That being said, the refresh rate is very noticeable for sure.The build quality of the phone is quite good for the price. While the phone does have a plastic back, it doesn't feel cheap and feels quite sturdy in the hand. The aluminum sides give it a very premium look, even when coupled with the glass back. That being said, having seen the durability tests on youtube, which seemed to highlight that the phone has a lot of vulnerabilities in the build sturdiness. So I'd recommend treating this phone and putting a case on it if using it.The software experience is not too bad. I love the amount of customisation MIUI offers, from the huge selection of user made themes available, to the smaller quality of life changes from the ability to hide the notch to the ability to go as far as changing the phones font. However I did notice that the phone forces apps to go an dark mode when dark mode is turned on, which causes some images appear incorrectly on the apps. Also, there are times when the screen goes completely unresponsive, and forcing a shutdown is the only way to get the phone back to normal. Other than this, the software is good. A major plus is the fact that the phone comes with Android 11 out of the box, and the phone doesn't have any heating issues. The only time I noticed heating issues is when the phone was running a video call in windowed mode. Since this puts the phone under a considerable amount of load, I would give it a pass. Another thing I would like to bring to light is the fact that flashing an custom ROM will take a few days, as MI seems to have a weird approval system.A major positive about the phone is the camera. The camera works wonderfully, whether the app being used is the stock camera or GCam. When compared to GCam, the stock camera seems to churn out more brighter images. However, I think that GCam churns out more ""accurate"" images. There is an beautification effect on selfies which is not very noticeable on the stock camera app, but when compared to images taken through GCam, which are a lot more accurate, it becomes very obvious. To sum up the camera performance however, it is excellent and extremely reliable. Definitely worth going for if you want to take great high quality pictures. The Wide Angle camera could use some improvement, but the Macro and the main 64 MP shooter are absolutely wonderful.I cannot comment on the battery life yet as I haven't used my phone for a full day outside yet. But from what I can tell the battery has given me 8 hours SOT on light usage when going from 30-100, which is impressive. The battery doesn't discharge fast as well. However, it is to be noted that I mostly use my phone on the 60 Hz setting, so my results can vary greatly from the others. The phone charges fast enough, but since I rarely charge my phone to a full battery, preferring to do it in small spurts instead, I cannot say much about the charging speed other than saying that it charges fast.One positive change that Xiaomi seemed to have implemented in the current set of phones is the fact that there are no ads inbuilt in important UI areas, like settings and the notification bar. Having used the Redmi Note 4 in the past, I can tell that this used to be the case for their older devices. This seems to have been done in response to pressure from users and influencers. That being said, their inbuilt preloaded applications do display many advertisements through notifications and can easily be turned off by stopping notifications from said apps. Once this is done, then you won't see advertisements in the phone at all. I must note that Xiaomi's business model for their budget devices revolves around these advertisements (they refer to it as services), it is to be expected in their Redmi line of devices. I am pointing this out to show that there is an extra cost the end user pays for due to the low budget margins of these budget devices, and that cost comes in the form of these advertisements in the UI. This business model is implemented so that they can offer better value as compared to their competitors.While I am not a huge mobile gamer anymore, I have tried playing Battlegrounds India for around half an hour just to see how it was. The game worked well, and there didn't seem to be much of a difference in real time performance as compared to my older OnePlus 7. I did not notice any heating on the device. However, it is to be noted that the OnePlus 7 has a much higher AnTuTu benchmark rating as compared to this phone. While this phone is certainly not a slouch when it comes to gaming, I think that the POCO X3 Pro is a much better pick than the Redmi Note 10 Pro if gaming is a priority given its powerful SD 860 chipset.The speakers are really loud and play music really clearly. They work significantly better than the speakers on my older OnePlus device. I was also happy to get the headphone jack back as well, and it works well with my current KZ Edx OEMs. I'm happy to note that the phone provides the option to expand storage which I definitely will be taking advantage of in the future.So, to sum it up, the phone is a good pick in this price range, due to its well rounded offerings. The camera, the display, the speakers, and the battery life come together to make this phone a good package. There are minor hitches with the software that could be improved in the future, and the vulnerabilities in the build are a cause for concern. However, as long as used properly and carefully, I really don't think that anything will happen to the device.Salient points from the above observations:1. The phone has a good and premium looking design. However there are questions about the durability.2. The phone has a great and reliable camera, human faces are given a ""beautification"" effect by the stock camera.3. There are issues with the software, such as a flashing display and an aggressive dark mode, along with random freezes.4. The battery life is quite decent and the phone lasts long.5. Has an acceptable gaming performance, but there are better picks in this price range for this purpose, like the POCO X3 Pro.6. Ads are only present in the pre-loaded apps, can be disabled by turning off all notifications from these apps.7. The phone has a wait time before allowing the bootloader to be unlocked, to be noted if you want to flash a ROM on this device.10. Has a beautiful display that competes strongly with my older OnePlus 7.Note: I have not used the Fingerprint sensor as I don't want to store my biometric data on the device."
4,"I've been using this for a week now.Ok, so the hardware is good. Like, really good..and all the positives you can deduce from that. I'll explain the negatives here.Battery backup at 120 hz is not impressive. With lockdown it got me through 3 quarters of a day.The phone does not overheat as some reviews over here say. It does get warm, but there's a difference between warm and overheat.The dark mode is impressive, but some apps, including Amazon does not react well to it. It tries to make all white backgrounds black and grey-ish, making some text hard to read.The always on display doesn't come up 10-15% of the time. It comes up when u touch the screen with screen off, but not immediately. Slowly fades into view, with really low brightness. It really frustrates you when you're trying to take a quick glance at the time.The camera is excellent. Video is bright and stabilised at 720p and 1080p 30fps. But 1080p 60fps is dark compared to the other two and not stabilised. 4k 30fps is ok.If u don't want ads, disable every personalisation option in this.I'll update this if more problems appear.Make a smart choice. There are better phones coming. I'd wait if I were you.Edit:So, I had cited problems with notifications, which were fixed with miui 12.5. Finally!.The only problem I face rn is the finger print sensor not always picking up my finger. It does it fast most of the times..but sometimes it gets a bit lazy xD.There are some bugs in miui that have not yet been corrected. For example. Instagram sometimes hangs. prob a software issue tho. No problems"
1,Display continuously flickering....They're trying AMOLED but failureüëéNo correction update yet....I don't know maybe hardware failure....Waste of money... I used the mobile after 3rd of parcel received.... Can't return....
3,"Previously used honor 8 for 3 and half years before buying this phone.Cons:Display is terrible in low brightness in both 120hz and 60hz modes. Purple tint is very apparent in dark mode throughout the OS and in apps too. There's blotches of color while watching darker scenes in netflix which makes it unwatchable. For example, the movie tamasha has a lot of scenes in the night and they all look pretty blotchy and full of artifacts.The camera processing is really bad. Artificial look with extremely high sharpness in most scenes. Objects have a halo around them and it is really distracting. Gcam solves this issue but is not reliable enough for daily use.Proximity sensor issue is really annoying and you have to do the action of bringing the phone to your ears in order to trigger it. Doesn't work 50% of the time and you could accidentally touch the screen.Fingerprint sensor worked fine in the beginning but it seems to fail 4 out of 10 times now.Always on display does not work without turning off 'MIUI Optimizations' setting but then again floating windows do not work when the setting is turned off. MIUI 12 needs a lot of bug fixes.Pros:Display is smooth. 120hz works fine on my phone although there are people who have stated that it doesn't work on their phones. My unit has no problems with refresh rate.Display gets really bright in direct sunlight so no problems viewing outdoors.Battery life and charging speed both have been great apart from the occasional glitch.Haptics, speakers, earpiece are great. Speakers have true stereo separation.I put a case on the phone as soon as I got it so can't say much about build quality. The phone is pretty heavy compared to my previous phone and due to 6.67 inches of display size, it's difficult to use one-handed.Conclusion... Buy it only if you want to live with the cons mentioned above. I have ordered a replacement so I will update this review with new info pretty soon."
1,Dont buy this it is not worth for money. It is working slow
5,Pros:-1. Display (Best display you can get at this price i.e.  Super Amoled with 90Hz Refresh Rate2. üîã Battery (6000 mAh big battery)3. Camera ( 64 mp) and selfie (20 mp) and if you  know you know samsung image processing  software.4. Looks and back Design ( Awesome Pattern with  rainbow üåà reflection.)5. Compact Size (6.4inches) not too big and not  too small.......handy..Cons:-1. Processor (mediatek helio g80) which is a low  end processor and it might not affect your  overall performance if you are not a heavy  gamer or something like that.2. Infinity U display. Nowadays drop notch display  is kinda outdated look since overall look of the  phone is great but this small thing is like a black  spot on a white chart paper.##But Also keep that in Mind how can you get  everything in just 14999 -17999 ........in mid  range...these specs are perfect and at last you  can trust the brand name too.üòè
4,Cons:1.Good phone at this price.2.Display Quality is really great. Looks premium3.Camera is also very nice in daylight. In indoor it takes some shacky images.4. For Normal use I think it is best phone considering Samsung √Ämoled display and security.CONS:1. Could have been better if it comes with strong processor2. Samsung should have provided a Back case3. This phones support 25w charger but only 15w charger is provided so there must be 25w charger in the box
4,"I am sure there will be many reviewers who will do an in-depth analysis and list out the pros and cons of the device. So here i am pointing out the negatives that i felt . First thing first, the ring volume is mediocre. Ring is not at all loud and i wondee whether I have recieved a faulty device.Second thing i loathe is that, the back cover is a fingerprint magnet. Some kind of resin or composite material is used.To be honest, i didn't like the phone much. The design is outdated and sub par a 10k phone. Since bought this for an elderly person, the ring volume was a total bummer for me. Thats it, another useless review from me."
1,"I purchased this phone on 16999 from Amazon by exchange .but I did not find any quality as per this high price.1. Phone touchscreen is very slow and sometimes hangs stop working.2 while viewing YouTube the voice is not coming clear sometimes voice going up and down ,  microphone and speaker of this phone is not up to the mark even I should say worst. Of its kind.3 this phone is marketed as 6 gb ram but most of the phone memory is already approx 3 gb is occupied by pre-installed app which you can not remove. This is complete cheating with customer regarding storage.4.in whatsapp I am unable to select the more  photos. Its processor is very slow.even slower than  my previous phone .Do not waste the money on the premium phone like these.Better go for any other company"
1,"This phone is not different then other Samsung phone.  Yeh log but be cheater hai , kuch bhi change nhi . 31 ka 32 fir krenge 33 . Battery utni bilkul nhi jitna Shor mcha rhe hai. Service ek dam ghatiya. Pause Jeb me darkness ke baad uchi deewaar par Chad jaate hai. Please don't  buy Samsung Mobiles more. Ab ye vo people wali companies nhi rhi."
1,"Big major charging issue, charging icon is seen during charging but charging is not increased, that's a very bad or not exceptable by samsungConclusion- company target is money making not making a quality device üò°Now my money is loss and we are crying üò≠üíîüò¢"
1,"Believe me, it's the slowest mobile I saw. Don't go on screen and Battery, it is an extremely slow mobile phone and takes ages to open and navigate. Forget about heavy use, it can't handle normal regular use. I made a huge mistake but pls don't buy this mobile. It's only a few months and I am thinking to change it. Its dam SLOW SLOW SLOW."
1,"So greatful to Amazon for sending me such a nice product which has already landed in samsung service centre twice within one month of purchase, it was possible only when amazon refused to take back the product within the return period even though they've so called 'no questions asked' return policy.Above all Samsung did a great jod too by keeping the phone with themselves for 10 days now, sometimes I forget that I just bought a new phone because either it's not with me most of the times or it is sick.Lastly Amazon didn't even bother to reply back to my grievances.Hats off to you guys."
1,Samsung  is forcing the user to install all the junk applications  in our phone.even the Ota update installing the junks.Performce of the phone is pretty decent.Camera is also giving the good shots but the junk app spoiling the party.More than a samsung phone you are purchasing  bundle of junk applications
1,Worst camera. Seems like camera of local phone.  Returning this back.Too heavy. Don‚Äôt know why they are considering that 64 mp. Poor camera quality.
1,1. Heavy heat on both the sides. Front and back also.2. Charging is very slow.
1,Terrible phone. Always hang and unusable. Returning the product. Don't but this
5,"Processer is good.Both side Camera performance is good.Camera functions is work properly.In Screen look use face sacaner than fingerprint.Provide pre-installed apps Samsung system,  Microsoft system, Google system and Netflix's ,Amazon, etc.Charging capacity is too low, take 1¬Ω hr to charge.Fingerprint sacaner too small, many times its doesn't match.Lots of app pre-installed.25GB memory used out of 128."
3,"I'm a just a basic user of phones.  No movies, no games.  I mainly use phone, messages, photos, chats and other social apps and some utilities.  For the price, the features seem impressive and for my mild usage this phone sounds great.What I did not like is the amount of apps that were already installed on the phone!  Then I had to un-select a whole bunch of ""recommended"" apps during setup.  I was pre-subscribed to 'diagnostics' and 'recommendation' and 'marketing' notification by default!  Is that allowed?  Some features don't work unless I use specific apps.  Basically, they are app features and not phone features.  Sounds 'grey-area' to me.After spending half a day to go through all the settings and clean up the mess I think I'm ready to use this phone.  I still wonder what else I missed..."
1,Don't buy this mob... Camera performance is worse than 8k mob... Battery backup gives 1days.. On 60ghz..... 15k wasted.. No nfc...  Lost trust on Samsung.
5,My review after a week of usagepros-------*Battery - lasting for 2 days*Display - Great AMOLED display*Separate slot for memory card*Camera is also goodcons-------*Sometime touch is not working.*Battery - taking 3 hours to get fully charged. Nowadays we can get phone charged within 2 hours*Notification light is missing. Every time we need to on the button to check whether we have received any calls or messages*It is said that 15w charger but in adapter it says 10w (5.0 V = 2.0 A)*Too much of unwanted apps are pre-installed*Very outdated processor.
1,I am fully disappointed with this model.perfomance wise not good . Operating app is also slow taking so much time to open and download app .aslo taking so much time to charge after 40 % any mobile take 45 to 60 min to full charge but this mobile take around 90 to 120 min to charge.not worth it .not recommended to any one .
1,Battery Life is very poor .Even though it is 6000 mah battery it doesn't last a full day and needs to be charged atleast twice a dayEven though it is less than one month it's UI constantly stops and have to be closed.The response is extremely poor .I have been using One Plus 5 for the past 2 and half years and its response is better than this new device which is hanging and apps are crashing time and again .I had preferred an Indian phone to Chinese one but have been extremely disappointed with the performance of this phone
2,"I don't suggest to buy this m32 mobile, there is no extra features as they mentioned in their options, there they mentions atmos dolby sound, but third class sound in speakers and that option is not working, secondly palm swipe for screen shot is not working camera is so so, very bad product from samsung, I tried all the ways to take screen shots using palm swipe but I can't, if possible pls replace with another item mr amazon"
1,"This fraud incident happened to me. I bought Samsung Galaxy M32 smartphone on Friday 6th August 2021 online from Amazon and received it on Monday. As soon as I opened the This fraud incident happened to me. I bought Samsung Galaxy M32 smartphone on Friday 6th August 2021 online from Amazon and received it on Monday. As soon as I opened the parcel, I turned on the phone and found that it was defective.There is the issue of no display with this phone. The same day, I requested a replacement, the phone was to be replaced on 13th Aug 2021, delivery agent comes to my residence for replacement but refused to replace the faulty phone saying that the phone has no display and arguing that he requires to dial  *#06# on the defective phone to get  IMEI number for verification which he will feed on amazon's Software.But it is a well-known fact that on any cellular device like Smartphones IMEI no is printed on the phone, their box, and also on the receipt. I asked him to enter the IMEI number printed on the receipt but he refused. Again Iasked him to wait for few minutes and not to cancel the replacement I will talk to customer care to sort out this problem. But he did cancel the replacement. he might do it intentionally to grab the phonelater on Amazon Assured that the amount will be refunded, but to the date, no money has been transferred, i was contacted costumer care of Amazon  again on 13 August for pickup the defective cellphone samsung M32 ,on 14th August agent comes to my residenti and he also refuse to collect , makeing same excuse that you cell phone was ded so that's why I am not able to collect ....So dear those wo are going to buy any products  from Amazon be aware that Amazon team in india is making a Big Scam with their courier agent ...Please be safe and aware don't buy any product form Amazon .Dear readers. If you want to buy any products online use another online cart , like flipkart , Mintra, Mishu , but never from Amazon boycott Amazon ..."
5,"Amazing phone. I would rank it the best overall phone experience. The pros are obviously known to everyone, the 90hz display is great. The touch feel is literally like butter. Cameras are great. Amazon prime runs in HD so widewine l1 is there. Speakers are loud, not tinny but lack bass. Can't complain.Phone requires careful first time setup to avoid ads as suggested by ranjit sir. No ads encountered yet. Everything works well, side mounted power button /finger print reader is fast and accurate. Light sensor, proximity sensor are flawless. These 2 are typically bad in Chinese phones (mi note 5 pro user) causing display to turn on when in call, so thumbs up.The cons: the processor seemed weak on paper, but the experience is great. Not that I am defending samsung, but a compromise 90% can blindly make. I do not play games, so can't say much but better processor phones out there. This is for general public who wants smooth experience of samsung phone and no software bugs.Some complained of emmc5 storage, but apps installed damn fast and I did not find and sluggish read write speed issue. Fast and phone did not heat during setup process when installing 100s of apps and no slowness observed. I have 2 m30s in house, they also pointed out better build quality, better looks of my black version and fluidity of screen. Good for light gaming. Go ahead with the phone for good vibes throughout phones life. Now samsung is giving 3 years of software updates, so great."
1,"Display is good and bright. Battery  average. It's not that speed being 6gb ram, while making  call it lags. Camera not upto mark, I miss grand camera which was better  than 64 mp. Over priced, don't have basic features  of other M series phone. On the name of brand Samsung started cheating people.  They should  atleast  provide  cover."
3,"After purchasing Samsung M12, was looking forward to getting M31, but the mobile was not available and the prices increased. After waiting for a month, saw that M32 is available so purchased it but not entirely happy with it. The phone rings on its own at times, chimes continuously other times without any call or notification being given. Phone lags at time and opening apps also takes time. Perhaps the 6gb variant is better but I have 4gb model. OneUI was supposed to be stable and I am quite disappointed with this particular purchase at least."
1,"This is my first review of Any product purchsed online. I'm shopping online since ages now. But this Phone FORCED me to write a review.I've been Using Asus Zenfone phones till date for my usage, Had a wonderful experience....First time ever shifted to Samsung just because of so called Brand Name.WORST DECISION.Camera OK.Battery OK.Performance OK.Screen OK.Brightness OK.Within 1 week Lock switch stopped working.I'm locking and unlocking by screen tap option because samsung people have said it'll take time to repair.Body completely cheap plastic material.Heats up with normal usage.When in pocket automatically wakes up and starts typing numbers or dials emergency number.With No disregard to Samsung I'm saying very bad phone you've made.Very overpriced. Should be of 9k or less.Others opinions may differ from me. This is just my personal experience.I'm sorry to give you less stars Samsung but please improve your quality not quantity. There is no mandate to launch new phone every week."
4,Pros: Screen resolution is good. Speed and performance is ok ok. Sometimes got little sluggy during parallel execution. Camera is very good quality. Battery life is good. SW is really smooth. Speaker is louder enough. Finally it's not a Chinese brand.Cons: No 4k or HDR video viewing. So some videos are blurry even though it is HD. During charging phone gets heated up. Tats may be it has bigger battery. 5G support is not Der since most phones are now with 5G. Price might have been little less to compete Chinese brands.

1,Camera quality not good and battery backup very bad.üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†
2,"Best camera quality at 15k Not for gamers only for simple multimedia use and want a secure phone. Yes it lags too much on normal and heavy use .No carrier aggregation by samsung prosser support carrier aggregation only 3 thing is good about this phone camera,display and battery"
5,"Using since last three days ...completely satisfied with everything. In this segment so many phones are available but if i get the SAMSUNG then why i should go anywhere else...Pros:Display - SAMOLED with Full HD, Side Curves make you feel so happy. Brightness is awesome.Sound - Dolby Sound is also good specially with wired headphone.Battery - Without internet 2 days do not worry to charge it and with internet one full day.Call Quality : Also goodVideo Calling - BestCamera : Picture is so goodProcessor - Fast as it comes with 90Hz refresh rate.Cons:Notification LED Indicator is missing but can be managed.RAM could be 8 GB but if you choose the quality then it can be also ignored. 6GB also working fine.Verdict: If you are not a GAMER then blindly you can grab it."
5,"Value for money and best is 90hz super amoled display and 64mp quad camera. Best for listening music and watching videos as it has 6000mah battery goes 1+1/2 day ""but this phone is not for gaming"""
4,"best Non-Chinese smartphone preference under 15K | Excellent battery | Decent Camera | Smooth | Stylish look | Mummy Loved it ( I gifted it to her)Not made for chhapri youth icons of India.Not the best camera phone under 15K.for gaming under 15k > Motorola G40 / POCO is better option.if you are a decent user, who loves to watch videos/ browse social apps then definitely go for this.for Mumma/PAPA this would be best choice rather than Chinese smartphones.(Thumbs UP) BATTERY : Screen On Time > More than 13H for Mumma. she watches Jio Tv & browse social apps quite often.(Processor) MTK G80 doesn't lag much as compare to Exynos processors + it is better optimized for battery consumption. example Samsung M21 2021 with same 6k mAh battery with Exynos processor gives 7-9h Screen on time only, while Samsung m32 with same 6K mAh battery with MTK Processor gives more than 10-12H screen on time."
2,Waste of money. Don't but this phone. I'll not recommend it to anyone. Today I received  this and within 24 hours am reviewing  the product.  It's not worth . Camera is bad. MI is much much much better. I shud have listed to other reviews  before buying this.
2,"Seeing few YouTube videos,I purchase it,  It's 7-Days now.Processor is G80 , Which Don't support 90Hz& Don't support 2k Videos & Pics.,But, People who use for minimum usage like 2-3hr YouTube,  Amazon videos good.Most time it's 60hz , so, u feels Videos üìπlag ,When u take FHD pic it takes 2-4sec to save it.I am feeling M40 which I got 3-years back is much faster..So, Always go with Snapdragon processor.."
5,"The youtuber reviews will tell you that this phone doesn't have a powerful processor that others will offer you at this price range. It is a fantastic mobile for an average user like me. You should have to look what your purpose of the mobile you want purchase. If you want to play games like pubg and you want professional video/photoshoot this phone is not definitely not for you. It is good to watch youtube videos at high quality with samsung's amazing samoled screen, it can take some good photos and videos and can do some games even pubg at minimal settings.I thing like this people who drive  vehicle at a speed of 60 k.m per hour wants a car that have very powerful engine and they will never need that much power. Like that I don't need a very high performing processor and other features that I may not use.So think, if you are a person who only wants to use mobile for to make and take call and watch videos and occasionally wants to play some game, then this mobile is definitely for you.My job is some what risky and I need automatic call recorder to deal with my risky customers. This mobile has that feature. Its my purpose and that's why I bought this phone.Its a good phone an average customer."
5,"In love with this beast in reasonable price, camera quality is really great, screen resolution is far far clear and colour full, battery is strong, light weight, compact size, all required smart phone features are build in the phone. Good job Samsung team."
1,Do not buy. There are plenty of other good options for the price. Main issue is the PROCESSOR.  I just felt it's too slow compared to  the mobiles available.  Phone is also bit thick . And I think its manufacturing is stoped too.  It's only sold online. If I had a chance I would buy a different phone .
4,"Don't waste money on redmi or realme jst in sake for money. This phone is very nice for decent users. It is an all-rounder in all tasks, but for decemt usage. Camera is very nice than redmi, realme, oppo etc. Notch is very small and does not disturb. One UI 3.1 has tons of features to customize. My rating 8.5/10.All the Best!"
5,Great product. Bought it for display and battery.Cons...Processor is not powerful enough to draw 90hz. Battery is also drained so fast while use 90hz refresh rate.So I switched back to 60Hz. Performance improved and battery lasts longer than before.

1,I wasted my money. Lots of hangings and very slow. Network issues. This is not a 5G or even equal to 1G. Please do not buy this and waste your money. I asked for a refund but Amazon saying is can be replaceable. Not a good service by Amazon and don't know why they are selling such a third class mobile.
4,Mobile is good but net profile working is very slow. I am using airtel 4g sim but not working properly.Camera is not good.
5,Very good display and in hand feel is great. Good camera and it works decent in low light. Great battery life. Overall good phone. I got good first day offer discounts also. Colour os after update is working very smoothly and giving a great user experience.
1,"Recently I ordered it, while recording video from front camera, screen is becoming white and also the video,Also while normal uses, it hanging and screen is becoming black.This experience is necessary for the people who are going to buy new mobile with their hard earned money.Take care."
5,Best mid range 5G smartphone by OPPO.Pros :1. 5G support2. Clean Color OS by OPPO.3. Fast Charging with massive battery.4. Sound quality is decent.5. Light weight & handy phone.Cons :1. Camera needs improvement.2. Feels little bit bulky design.3. OPPO should provide earphones with box.
5,"My usecase - I replaced by secondary phone Redmi Note 4 - wanted to 5G phone with good battery and Sub 15K price tag. Primary use as a GPS navigation in car, Gaming and backup Hotspot phonePros -1) Very lightweight and extremely well built2) ColorOS is flawless - simple, elegant and bug free3) Decently fast phone and responds to quick touches well - especially while using at 90hz4) Able to handle games easily - its a future proof chipset5) Aesthetically, no concerns - decent phone to carry around6) Great connectivity with my various bluetooth enabled devices - My Bose 700 soundbar, Oppo Enco X TWS and even my fitbit smart band.7) Surprisingly good video call quality on selfie camera8) rear Camera setup - since not my primary phone, but if i have to rate it, i will give it 7/10.Cons -1) 18w is a decent charging adapter - but if u r used to faster charging, this will dissapoint you2) screen brightness is good, but being an ips LCD display, it will still keep you wanting more3)Mono Speakers are decent but not loud enough."
2,"I am writing my open review of this phone after using approximately 18daysPhone looks very good look wise 5 out of 5 üåüCamera quiliy is good but not expected from this price pointPhone some times working slow, something I feel I am using my old phone, it means phone performance is not match from my expectations, On this price we should have to buy another phones."
1,"The product which I got, it's not charging even after 4-5 hrs of continuous charging, frequent hanging, and d touch sensor s not dat much great compared to other products, I experience  frequent black outs even, it's disgusting to use this product"
3,"Phone design and look is ok... Camera quality is average (as I bought it for only 14000) it could be a way better.The phone has unique manufacturing defect that it gives error message while using that |the phone temperature is very high"" and automatically phone data and other programme stop working...Even the phone body not heat that much... This is the major issue as you can't use mobile data or camera without restarting the phone or leave for 10minute hold..."
4,Phone was awasome in its price range.there only 2 problems for this phone1 call recording it says when we start call recording. And auto call recording was only for contacts in mobile.2 mobile heat issue while charging.
5,"Very nice phone, I brought it at an offer period, but it cost is little bit more,Battery backup decentCamera clarify very goodPerformance... Very nice...Snapdragon Proceccer is the best compare to mediatek. Budget friendly phone, 128 gb and extra slot for increasing memory, 6 gb ram... Very good... Face recognition system and finger print sensor are awesome....."
1,"Pathetic camera quality, network connectivity and video call picture & voice. Voice is coming broken. I request everyone who is willing to buy this phone, please please don't buy this phone, specially when u r willing to buy from Amazon. They r cheating with customers. On 2nd day i tried to return this mobile but they r not returning it, they want to send technician. What technician can do with the camera quality."
3,Phone is heavy. Annoying app in phone which you cannot remove. No one will write about the bloatware. This is data stealing strategy adopted by big players in market. I wonder after paying 18k for phone still I have to deal with bloatware. It's better to take phone with stock android like Micromax.
1,Never ever buy this phone. This is a failed model. Camera quality and performance is below 1 star. Battery life is half an hour if you are streaming videos and plus it takes more than an hour to charge which is opposite to company's commitment. This is completely waste of money.The below review is for Amazon company.Plus whe I tried to return they asked me arrange for visit at home to check the phone. The technician did not show up however they updated on system that the visit was completed which is wrong.
4,The Product is nice the Only issue is with Charging time. It claims 18W fast charging but taking more than usual to charge. It took around 120 minutes to charge from 41-100%. Either the charger supply is underrated or company is claiming it wrong.
3,"on the time of call recording other person knows the this call is going to record, Screan recording issue."
1,"I am not able to connect my Bluetooth with it, and it has a hanging problem too, I can't send a video call from the phone , I am not able to accept the video call, the calling sound quality is not that great üòí"
2,"It takes 145 minutes to full charge.Facing issues with sim slot1.Camera is normal as other oppo phones.Battery life is good.It could have been cheaper.Front camera is 8 mp ,it could have been better."
5,Best smart phone I have purchased so far in such reasonable price with exchange of my old phone I got Rs 4000 discount. There are lots of advance and useful features in this phone which will give you the feeling like the costly phones. Great feeling in hand like a chocolate bar and you want to bite it. Excellent design.
3,"I am writing this review after three and half month of purchase. I have purchased a few mobiles beforr but never got so much frustrated like this one. As per my opinion, not worth the money, typing is the worst experience for me as well as the sound quality. I do neither play games nor watch movies, so no review for that.If you are a phone addicted person, then you shouldn't go for this one. Touch quality os also very poor in comparison with money. Overall comparing with price my rating is maximum 2.7/5."
2,"Device is little heavy. Camera quality is average and not appear of 48 mega pixel. Camera quality has really disappointed me. Screen is also not soothing for eyes. Overall, it's doesn't satisfy the brand reputation and money spent on it."
5,"This mobile phone is the best phone available under ‚Çπ 20,000 with 5G technology.  Here are some of the features of this phone:Pros -1. Cheapest phone with a 5G snapdragon processor, dedicated memory card slot with two SIMs.2. It's dual 5G phone which means you don't need to change the SIM slot to change the 5G usage between two service providers.3. 6 GB RAM which can be enhanced by 5 GB extra.4. Good battery life. It is running almost 40-45 hours with descent usage which includes WhatsApp, news reading and other daily usage with 4-5 hours of wi-fi support to laptop.5. Supports almost all the features required in a mobile of this category with many shortcuts.Cons -1. Doesn't have IR blaster which is required to use it as a remote control.2. Camera is decent but could have been better.3. Size is little large for men but almost all the phones are coming with this size only and hence, we don't have options.4. Too many pre-installed apps which can't be removed/uninstalled/disabled.There are other phones in the competition but all others lack some or other feature e.g. dedicated memory card slot or snapdragon processor (as mediatek processors are leading in 5G race)."
5,"Being an IT Head I always look for tech specifications of a mobile before purchasing the same.  After a lot of browsing, reading about specifications about the latest mobiles 6GB+128GB, I've selected this product to gift this product to my Daughter on her birthday. A little bit confusion was there about the product. But when my daughter received it, she is very happy about the specification & about the look. The glossy finishing of the back is too pretty. My daughter has installed the 'Genshin Impact' in this mobile, it is running very smooth way. And I've checked all of the functions of the same. Camera resolutions is too good. One of the best product."
1,I got a faulty product so I have raised a complaint to exchange but they don't have this phone in stock
4,"Though it's relatively new. I loke this phone. It's fast, clear cam with many options.Battery backup is good as of now.Being into marketing, my phone usage is very high. Also I watch movies and play games.Still it gives 24 hr backup with everything.As of now, I am liking it."
5,Just loved it ....Cons: 90hz refresh rate is just awesome .Finger print sensors are too good and even face lock.The processor is smooth and the battery is just love easily last for 1.5 days with normal use and a day with heavy use.Cons : I haven't found any cons.
4,"It's a choice able budget 5G smart phone. Very good looks, built quality decent, performance smooth, display and touch excellent, battery acceptable, voice and sound quality very good, no network issue, no heating issues, but cameras not good at all. SAR value is low in this segment 5G(Head: 1.066 & Body:0.607).Though it's the review after 18 hrs of uses. The actual review will be done after 1month of uses."
5,Looking is awesome and stylish look ...I feel it's quite better and budget 5g phone.  Performance also very good..go for it...
5,"Phone is very good. Box comes with phone case(synthetic) also phone has temper glass sticked to it, No heating , Just used it for a day, Good battery backup"
1,Sound quality is not good
5,"6bg with 128gb is sufficient for regular use. 2 days of using with 6-7hr approx talk and mail , WhatsApp network usgae. Battery goodCharging time little longer compared to other models fast charging I m not quite happy as it takes 2 hrs for complete charge.Overall 8/10"
4,"Using 1 weekBettery : as mentioned in descriptionCamera quality : not as much setisfy as other oppo phone, If yor looking for camera Go for otherPicture Quality: with FHD+ picuture GoodGame Performance: If you Looking For Pubg , Not supported XtremeBut you can't depend on Last bettery bellow 20%.

5,Camera and battery life is very very good and this phone comes with 90 hz refresh rate and 5G that‚Äôs make this phone very awesome in middle range budget phones.I am a iOS user so I am purchased this phone for my mother and My mom very happy after getting this.Thanks Amazon and Appario üëå
5,"One of the best phone within 16-17k range. Purchased for 15k.Good and fluid performance, good camera, easy to handle, body weight ratio is good. Can easily handle by one hand. Outdoor pics r good, indoor pics r OK. Can easily handle multiple tasks. Battery back up is excellent.In the midrange it's one of the best phones, don't compare with phones above 50k."
1,"I was happy to get the phone at a price 17k. However, the feeling is vanising slowly as the phone screen is glitchy(during audio calls the display vanishes and appear like a CRT TV without cable connection-signal noise on screen). This is my second phone from OPPO and both times made me hate the company more."
3,"Performance wise good but seems I received used/Someone returned phone.Screen guard, and multiple apps telling this is used. FB, YouTube,YouTube Music, music party, Music, Gpay, flipkart, Amazon, Hey fun, hey tap, like gaming related, photos related, space related like clone, Google drive etc and Many apps are available. I would like to return but took it on Emi basis and need phone.Is this issue from Oppo or Amazon? Not satisfied and no feeling that I bought a new phone"
3,Good 5g phone from oppo....Features and everything is fine but only disappointment is the camera as I was expecting a better camera as such price from oppo. But camera is just OK.
1,Very disappointed with the overall performance from Samsung
4,"Got the mobile on the launch date,Battery must be appreciatedCamera is just averageMobile performance is above average90hz refresh rate? If u r buying the mobile for this feature then I'm afraid u may get disappointed, it's just normal.The USB cable is too small in lengthIt's a good mobile in this budget, there are no returns for this,  only replacement is available, hence choose wisely before buying"
3,Camera quality is low
1,"1. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.2. Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one.3. Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.4. No return policy, you will have to live with the phone you didn't like. Now you decide."
1,"Not worth buying....faulty software, poor display quality, single band wifi doesn't support  5ghz WIFI band. Gyro sensor missing and many more. DONT GO BY PAID REVIEWS IN YOU TUBE"
5,"In this budget, it has exceeded all expectations .. I have primarily taken this phone for the battery and so far not disappointed"
1,I will never purchase Samsung phones. Phone is lagging too much and slow. Waste of hard earning money.
1,This is worst samsung mobile I have seen from samsung. It's sceen quality and colors are trash. Even a old 5000 rs phone can beat it's quality. Please never ever buy this product.

1,Very poor quality camera .Found box seal damage still Amazon not taking it back.waste of money.Phone very slow.Don‚Äôt buy from Amazon.Now Amazon started cheating customers to make profits.
1,"Worst camera quality. It is like 2 megapixel camera. Photos are very worst. If you slightly zoom the photo,  you can see blurry...Previously I used 13 megapixel amera phone. Those photos are very good."
1,"No 5Ghz wifi band on this mobile, miserable in 2021 , even my previous mobile of Samsung which I bought in 2017 have 5Ghz wifi , it's a big comedy"
1,Don't received  handset ejection  pin  and manual.
5,Just unboxed the phone.Seems to be a better one in this price segment as of now.Just checked with the camera & voice it seems good but one thing it's very heavy in weight may be due to battery.Hope samsung lives upto expectation.
1,very poor build qualityvery poor camera piclow quality phoneno return policyvery worst mobilejust making fool to customer by samsung m12 and Amazon
1,Hitting issue
1,Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don't waste money on this product.
1,"Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price."
5,"This is perfect phone, good speed, decent specs and outstanding battery life. The look of the device is also attractive. Above all, the trust of company."
1,"PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
1,"Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don't buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI."
1,Dislike
2,"Product specifications are not at par..Display is below average.Camera quality is just okay..It doesnt support 5ghz wifi, which is not mentioned anywhere so please make sure before buying.."
1,Self camera is just like 2 mega pixels.
1,"The user experience is pathetic on these cheap phones. Its filled to the brim with bloatware that you can't remove.You're better off getting the Mi phones as they have a far better UIAlso, I can't return this garbage of a phone as Samsung don't list this as a software issue.I'll have to look into installing lineage os and de-google this phone before using it but that's easier said than done."
1,Just for name sake Cam & Battery are 48mp & 6000mah. But coming to reality it is poor. The weight of the phone also almost 250gm so it is not a smart phone it is a hard phone. And the top menu bar beside front cam is not responding sometimes.
5,"A very satisfying  experience with the device so  far.Pros:1. Long battery life-  I am a moderate  user who does everything  except gaming. That said , the battery lasts up to 2 full days.2. Decent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.3. Very responsive finger print sensor.4. Good sound quality, although dolby's impact  is not much pronounced5. UI is great and snappy. Lots of customization options.6. The display is good and smooth with 90hz refresh rate. It does make the difference.7. Fast charging works fine.Cons:1. The weight of the phone is on the heavier side @ 220 gms2. The display could have been a full HD+ @ 1080p3. No led notification light. All though there are apps that can do the job on an AMOLED screen.Overall, a good package."
1,Horrible product
1,"Not a good mobile.Quite heavy in weight, you will obviously feel it. Weight is 220 gms which is far exceeding acceptable range. Can definitely be used as paperweight.Nothing special in screen, processor or camera also.Just a marketing gimmick by samsung.Stay away.. At 13.5k we deserve far better than this."
3,Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn‚Äôt give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you‚Äôre choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you‚Äôll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review
4,I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1. Battery and Camera.1. BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non sense.I played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98% to 80 %2. Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this
1,Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp
1,"This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information."
5,"It's a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they're wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it üòå. Once again no complains regarding anything."
1,Look is average. Battery life is good. Only go ahead if you just need a good brand name otherwise 100 of options are available in market. You will definitely get disappointed with camera which is actually not more than 12 mega pixels.  This phone nothing but a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached. Samsung must call back these phones as it is definitely going to kill the brand name. I will highly appreciate if Amazon has the guts to publish this review. This is an open challenge to Amazon...
2,"The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box"
4,"Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage .  I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck .Awesome battery life , and that's what I want . I am just using it for basic social media and calls .. rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device .CAMERA is average , My ipad's 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called ""true"" 48MP.My advice-- go for 6gb variant as 2.5 gb is acquired by the system .Overall - 4‚òÜ"
1,"Disappointed with this mobile.... PhonePay & GooglePay apps are not working properly.... Numbers visible only half and getting overlapped....and we're end up typing wrong Pin numbers.... multiple times we have changed the Pin for these apps... now a days We regularly use mobile for online payments but this mobile is not useful for online payments due to app issues.We have tried to return this mobile, but Amazon return policy date was over by the time we found the issue."
5,I am using this phone for the last one week and i noticed few positive and negative things about it.Positive points -‚Ä¢ Fingerprint sensor is so fast and i loved it‚Ä¢ Battery backup (6000 mAh) is amazing even after using it throughout the day‚Ä¢ Camera quality is really good and the pictures are amazing on day light‚Ä¢ Large display having a size of 6.5 inches and can run games smoothly on low graphic settings‚Ä¢ 90Hz refresh rate feels so smooth‚Ä¢ The phone doesn't lag or get heated after using it for a long time because of Exynos 850 (8nm) high-end processorNegative points -‚Ä¢ Not made for hard-core gaming because the processor is not strong enough to run games smoothly on high graphics‚Ä¢ The weight of phone is heavy‚Ä¢ The brightness level is somewhat low as compared to other phones‚Ä¢ The display that you will get is around 720 x 1600 pixels‚Ä¢ The downloading as well as uploading speed is also low as compared to other phones within this price range‚Ä¢ It is not water resistant and does not have Gorilla glass for screen protection .~ I am satisfied with this phone because of it's camera quality and battery backup ‚àö
1,"Phone is good but lready used, FB messenger logged in with unknown ID. Top transparent sheet missing on phones screen, Frequently hanging during usage. Phone already updated it's meant used phone. Unable to replace. Unable to register complaint. Please help."
3,Look - Rating 4/5Camera - 3/5Battery - 3.5/5Performance 3.5/5Overall 3.5/5 on Middle range 5G..
5,Really awesome display üòç super camera super design fabulous üòçüíê
1,I wasted my money. Lots of hangings and very slow. Network issues. This is not a 5G or even equal to 1G. Please do not buy this and waste your money. I asked for a refund but Amazon saying is can be replaceable. Not a good service by Amazon and don't know why they are selling such a third class mobile.
4,Mobile is good but net profile working is very slow. I am using airtel 4g sim but not working properly.Camera is not good.
5,Very good display and in hand feel is great. Good camera and it works decent in low light. Great battery life. Overall good phone. I got good first day offer discounts also. Colour os after update is working very smoothly and giving a great user experience.
1,"Recently I ordered it, while recording video from front camera, screen is becoming white and also the video,Also while normal uses, it hanging and screen is becoming black.This experience is necessary for the people who are going to buy new mobile with their hard earned money.Take care."
5,Best mid range 5G smartphone by OPPO.Pros :1. 5G support2. Clean Color OS by OPPO.3. Fast Charging with massive battery.4. Sound quality is decent.5. Light weight & handy phone.Cons :1. Camera needs improvement.2. Feels little bit bulky design.3. OPPO should provide earphones with box.
5,"My usecase - I replaced by secondary phone Redmi Note 4 - wanted to 5G phone with good battery and Sub 15K price tag. Primary use as a GPS navigation in car, Gaming and backup Hotspot phonePros -1) Very lightweight and extremely well built2) ColorOS is flawless - simple, elegant and bug free3) Decently fast phone and responds to quick touches well - especially while using at 90hz4) Able to handle games easily - its a future proof chipset5) Aesthetically, no concerns - decent phone to carry around6) Great connectivity with my various bluetooth enabled devices - My Bose 700 soundbar, Oppo Enco X TWS and even my fitbit smart band.7) Surprisingly good video call quality on selfie camera8) rear Camera setup - since not my primary phone, but if i have to rate it, i will give it 7/10.Cons -1) 18w is a decent charging adapter - but if u r used to faster charging, this will dissapoint you2) screen brightness is good, but being an ips LCD display, it will still keep you wanting more3)Mono Speakers are decent but not loud enough."
2,"I am writing my open review of this phone after using approximately 18daysPhone looks very good look wise 5 out of 5 üåüCamera quiliy is good but not expected from this price pointPhone some times working slow, something I feel I am using my old phone, it means phone performance is not match from my expectations, On this price we should have to buy another phones."
1,"The product which I got, it's not charging even after 4-5 hrs of continuous charging, frequent hanging, and d touch sensor s not dat much great compared to other products, I experience  frequent black outs even, it's disgusting to use this product"
3,"Phone design and look is ok... Camera quality is average (as I bought it for only 14000) it could be a way better.The phone has unique manufacturing defect that it gives error message while using that |the phone temperature is very high"" and automatically phone data and other programme stop working...Even the phone body not heat that much... This is the major issue as you can't use mobile data or camera without restarting the phone or leave for 10minute hold..."
4,Phone was awasome in its price range.there only 2 problems for this phone1 call recording it says when we start call recording. And auto call recording was only for contacts in mobile.2 mobile heat issue while charging.
5,"Very nice phone, I brought it at an offer period, but it cost is little bit more,Battery backup decentCamera clarify very goodPerformance... Very nice...Snapdragon Proceccer is the best compare to mediatek. Budget friendly phone, 128 gb and extra slot for increasing memory, 6 gb ram... Very good... Face recognition system and finger print sensor are awesome....."
1,"Pathetic camera quality, network connectivity and video call picture & voice. Voice is coming broken. I request everyone who is willing to buy this phone, please please don't buy this phone, specially when u r willing to buy from Amazon. They r cheating with customers. On 2nd day i tried to return this mobile but they r not returning it, they want to send technician. What technician can do with the camera quality."
3,Phone is heavy. Annoying app in phone which you cannot remove. No one will write about the bloatware. This is data stealing strategy adopted by big players in market. I wonder after paying 18k for phone still I have to deal with bloatware. It's better to take phone with stock android like Micromax.
1,Never ever buy this phone. This is a failed model. Camera quality and performance is below 1 star. Battery life is half an hour if you are streaming videos and plus it takes more than an hour to charge which is opposite to company's commitment. This is completely waste of money.The below review is for Amazon company.Plus whe I tried to return they asked me arrange for visit at home to check the phone. The technician did not show up however they updated on system that the visit was completed which is wrong.
4,The Product is nice the Only issue is with Charging time. It claims 18W fast charging but taking more than usual to charge. It took around 120 minutes to charge from 41-100%. Either the charger supply is underrated or company is claiming it wrong.
3,"on the time of call recording other person knows the this call is going to record, Screan recording issue."
1,"I am not able to connect my Bluetooth with it, and it has a hanging problem too, I can't send a video call from the phone , I am not able to accept the video call, the calling sound quality is not that great üòí"
2,"It takes 145 minutes to full charge.Facing issues with sim slot1.Camera is normal as other oppo phones.Battery life is good.It could have been cheaper.Front camera is 8 mp ,it could have been better."
5,Best smart phone I have purchased so far in such reasonable price with exchange of my old phone I got Rs 4000 discount. There are lots of advance and useful features in this phone which will give you the feeling like the costly phones. Great feeling in hand like a chocolate bar and you want to bite it. Excellent design.
3,"I am writing this review after three and half month of purchase. I have purchased a few mobiles beforr but never got so much frustrated like this one. As per my opinion, not worth the money, typing is the worst experience for me as well as the sound quality. I do neither play games nor watch movies, so no review for that.If you are a phone addicted person, then you shouldn't go for this one. Touch quality os also very poor in comparison with money. Overall comparing with price my rating is maximum 2.7/5."
2,"Device is little heavy. Camera quality is average and not appear of 48 mega pixel. Camera quality has really disappointed me. Screen is also not soothing for eyes. Overall, it's doesn't satisfy the brand reputation and money spent on it."
5,"This mobile phone is the best phone available under ‚Çπ 20,000 with 5G technology.  Here are some of the features of this phone:Pros -1. Cheapest phone with a 5G snapdragon processor, dedicated memory card slot with two SIMs.2. It's dual 5G phone which means you don't need to change the SIM slot to change the 5G usage between two service providers.3. 6 GB RAM which can be enhanced by 5 GB extra.4. Good battery life. It is running almost 40-45 hours with descent usage which includes WhatsApp, news reading and other daily usage with 4-5 hours of wi-fi support to laptop.5. Supports almost all the features required in a mobile of this category with many shortcuts.Cons -1. Doesn't have IR blaster which is required to use it as a remote control.2. Camera is decent but could have been better.3. Size is little large for men but almost all the phones are coming with this size only and hence, we don't have options.4. Too many pre-installed apps which can't be removed/uninstalled/disabled.There are other phones in the competition but all others lack some or other feature e.g. dedicated memory card slot or snapdragon processor (as mediatek processors are leading in 5G race)."
5,"Being an IT Head I always look for tech specifications of a mobile before purchasing the same.  After a lot of browsing, reading about specifications about the latest mobiles 6GB+128GB, I've selected this product to gift this product to my Daughter on her birthday. A little bit confusion was there about the product. But when my daughter received it, she is very happy about the specification & about the look. The glossy finishing of the back is too pretty. My daughter has installed the 'Genshin Impact' in this mobile, it is running very smooth way. And I've checked all of the functions of the same. Camera resolutions is too good. One of the best product."

3,Good 5g phone from oppo....Features and everything is fine but only disappointment is the camera as I was expecting a better camera as such price from oppo. But camera is just OK.
1,3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera. In very disappointed  with this kind of front camera. Need refund.
5,"This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now. (Aug 2021 - excellent, no issues at all üëç)Go for it without any doubt."
5,"Best camera, very good battery life, eat body material, average weight, best performance,  best display."
1,"Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom."
1,"The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller."
1,"I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.Face unlock very slow.Heat issue which charging and heavy usageFull charge takes more than 3 hrsWould not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phonego with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality"
1,"Software is no working. No sounds in media, cant attend calls, every 5 mints phone gone to switched off and even though no retraining option."
2,"Phone camera is not good , samsung says it's 64 mega pixel but its photos like 8 megapixels .photo detailing are not good  . Also processor is not Upton the mark it's some time slow and hang in multi function use . While using keyboard , keyboard hide automatically for 1 second . My mobile variant is 6 GB 128 GB. Don't waste your time and money ."
1,"Camera front is worst, not up to the mark. Waste of money. ,"
3,Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB). But got shocked to see the poor performance n battery life. The 64MP images can't be sent easily to someone on WhatsApp. Camera give errors now n then. Battery life worst then M30 which has 5000mh. Mobile heats on charging.
5,Mind blowing  camera real monster battery look awesome and fist first launch first hand
1,I purchased this phone by seeing 64 MP for camera usage but M31 was the worst phone with camera quality.. Front camera is 8 and back camera was 16 MP not more that that.. there is no return option only replacement(Good game was playing by samsung &Amazon) please dont buy this mobile and dont waste your money... Heating problem while charging.. etc  i am really  very frustrated with this phone quality.. i lost my money by buying this phone..üòîüòîüò™
5,"1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. üëç"
4,"HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks."
1,"Not satisfied with the qualityDisplay quality is no adequateBody is made of plastic like materialI was using MI like 6 plus pro then 7 plus proFor a change I have purchased this product, the quality is not up to the mark when comparing to my old redmi note seriesThe sound quality is very worst.While making call with full volume it is not clear from the day of purchase.I am planning to go back to MI againWorst phone pls don't buyNot value for money"
1,Phone is very slow my opinion is west ur money
1,Average
1,"I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made. Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product. Amazon has agreed post diagnosis saying its a faulty piece  but does not give refund"
2,"Cons:Button position (power& volume) too highFingerprint reader too highHeats up a lot.Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutesSpeaker volume low.The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls.Pros:Feels lightweightNice display.The camera is decent.Update 1:Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer.Update 2:Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement.Update 3:Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality. I have to put the call on 100% volume to be able to hear at least a bit."
3,UNTILL I AM USING REDMI NOTE 7 PROI WANT TO PURCHASE POCO X2 BUT BECAUSE OF IS FLASH SALEIT OUT OF STOCKI AM USING SAM M31 FROM LAST 5 DAYS OVERALL MY IMPRESSION IS  ITS 6000MH BATTERY1  SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY AT THIS PRICE2  64 MP CAMERA3  PHONES PERFORMANCE IS VERY SLOW4  I CAN NOT SINE ANY DRAMATIC CHANDE IN CAMERA QUALITY IN THIS PHONE5  SAMSUNG HAS TO WORK IN OPTEMISSING SOFTWARE TO INCREASE THE PHONES PERFORMANCE6  REDMI NOTE 7 PRO BOOTS FASTER THAN SAM M31
1,"Worst mobile was I got , Samsung m31 taking more time for charging 100% , it's almost 4 hours for charging , and after that 20 hours battery I'll train 0% its waste of time compare to other fast charging mobile , and camera worst"
1,"I bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day.  Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting  sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes. I expect this might be  software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me."
2,"I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed!I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung!I so miss my POCOFirst the pros1. The brand name - if you think it is one!2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos4. Build - seems decentCons:1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable üò≠. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app tooüò¨. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emailsüò≠. Believe me, I have tried all settings8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps üòÇü§£. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates meAnyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me nowWhat a waste of Money this has been"
1,"What is this samsung,i didn't expect from you.plastic body is ok we can use cover.Corning gorella glass 3 is ok we can use tempered protection.Even 3 hr charging time is ok we can charge during night.But Overheating how can we deal with them !this price range other companies providing super fast , cool processor like snapdragon 730G.& What you do fooling customers."
5,Received it on time within 24 hours thumps up to amazon. Now Product. Done all the settings. I am using samsung after a long gap of 8-10 years. After Samsung Grand I had stopped using. So setting done now data transfer Samsung's smart switch option is fantastic. Everything I wanted to transfer got it. No problem at all .Now SIM transferred. Done OK it is dual 4G VOLTE and above all it is having separate slot for micro sd card. Effortless working.Now Camera. It has got lot of options. All I have not yet tried but for sure I have checked the quality of the photograph and the night mode is superb. What else you want to know rest of the things are written in detail and is true. Working very fine. Proud to won it. Nice Product. Samsung should keep competing iPhone
5,Nice phone in this price range
2,"Cons:1. RAM. Claims to be 6GB, whereas my 2year old phone with 4GB RAM has much smoother display2. Battery Charging. Claims 15W fast charging. Takes more than 2 hours to charge the phone.Pros:1. Good cameras2. Perfect screen sizeI bought it as a great deal from Samsung, but it is a BIG dissappointment. And they say it cannot be returned. Total waste of money for me. Redmi Note pro 8 is much better than this at same price."
2,"1) claims 21 hour of internet usage timing, i started using it after 100charged  but it barely last for 24 hour with 5 hour of heavy usage and even turned mobile in bettery saving mode.  so what is the point of carry that much heavy 191gm device all around.2) phone heats a lot while its charging ,like you can't even touch it at some point.3)internet bandwith speed in mobile as well as in wifi is not good. i had a samsung galaxy note3 where i get fast internet with same network. wanted to return this device but they had a very strict policy so you cannot return, you can only replace it.  even i am trying it for replacement it wont let me as i have to download balencco app and this app never say your phone is not working fine. i could have spend my money in buying other phone.bought on very first minute of release but al excitment turned down after seeing actual performance."
1,"i am a Big fan of Samsung products, but today i got a dead phone, first i thought it don't have charging so try to charge the phone but no response,i am really really disappointed today. but thanks to amazon the responded quickly and ordered a replacement. but now i am worried about phone performance now. how i am going to handle if future same problem arises. before buy think again."
1,"Worst experience ever, camera quality not better 5out of 2, battery down very fast, max 3 hours taken charging 100% ,sometime WhatsApp hangups.108 gp free storage but mobile heating high, fingerprints only 3 finger available,  not better fingerprints,  I am the first buyer before launching. Over all don't buy this m 31. No extra protection, no additional option,  very simple mobile,not worthiness of money,"
5,"Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest‚Ä¢ PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.‚Ä¢ DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)‚Ä¢ BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.‚Ä¢CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device. You can always drop them on the comment)"
1,"First time met very bad experience from Samsung phone, camera quality is very poor. Front facing camera not good at all. Not comfortable with 6000mahbattery life.Amazon.india  just destroyed their Goodwill by selling this product.I purchased this phone for my friend. And now he is angry on me....Dear customer please avoid to buy this product."
1,Very poor performance.. camera is ok not bad . But very slow net speed .. opening app time is relatively fast but after internet is very slow .... my old mobile Samsung on max is much faster performance for loading web page than Samsung m31 .. this phone taking much more time to open any web site ... remaining everything is ok ..Fast changing is not far like they said .. 30 mins charging it charging 20% but my old Samsung is 30% charged at same time . I have found this two major drawback.
1,"Dear Amazon Team,I have been delivered faulty product from UP. It is just 15 days from buying the product and it was showing hang issue. and now this phone is dead and restart itself. No customer care is replying. Very poor service. Need replacement of the phone immediately."
4,I ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and consPros:1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also.2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ‚≠êÔ∏è)3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex
3,It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display & mammoth battery.Pros :1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.3. SAR rating - lowest one4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3. Not so great processorWho can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.
5,"Delivery was fast, packing was good, phone started quite unusual that applications were not even downloading on wifi, later after a couple of restarts it's good now. So thumps up , happy so far ."
1,So this is my edit review after using not more than 3months.. It has discolouration issue.. No any external force applied neither contact of water.. It happend when my phone's battery death and I plugged in with charger after then I putted off and I saw discolouration sudden..It started right bottom to top with pink and purple shade nd quickly spread overall display..And when I visited service center they directly denied to repair as told that it's not under in warranty.... Nd I'll have to bear that cost with Rs of 5000 to 6000 for change the display.. When I already spent 17000 Rs. to purchased new phone..DISGUSTING....And I believe that everyone keep their phone safely when atleast phone is new and expensive..I feel just regret about my decision and mistake I made to purchased this worst compny phone..But I surprised how Samsung play the scam game with their valuable customersNow I believe that Samsung is just fraud and fake and it's scam nd make fool to their customers in name of the warranty.I recommend to all Amazon buddies pls pls pls üôè don't go with Samsung Phone if you don't wanna waste your hard earn and valuable money....
5,"The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few daysCamera pictures are goodLots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually"
3,"I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.Pros:1. Display: Trust me it‚Äôs amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn‚Äôt work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don‚Äôt like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better."
1,Very disappointed with the overall performance from Samsung
4,"Got the mobile on the launch date,Battery must be appreciatedCamera is just averageMobile performance is above average90hz refresh rate? If u r buying the mobile for this feature then I'm afraid u may get disappointed, it's just normal.The USB cable is too small in lengthIt's a good mobile in this budget, there are no returns for this,  only replacement is available, hence choose wisely before buying"
3,Camera quality is low
1,"1. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.2. Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one.3. Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.4. No return policy, you will have to live with the phone you didn't like. Now you decide."
1,"Not worth buying....faulty software, poor display quality, single band wifi doesn't support  5ghz WIFI band. Gyro sensor missing and many more. DONT GO BY PAID REVIEWS IN YOU TUBE"
5,"In this budget, it has exceeded all expectations .. I have primarily taken this phone for the battery and so far not disappointed"
1,I will never purchase Samsung phones. Phone is lagging too much and slow. Waste of hard earning money.

1,Very poor quality camera .Found box seal damage still Amazon not taking it back.waste of money.Phone very slow.Don‚Äôt buy from Amazon.Now Amazon started cheating customers to make profits.
1,"Worst camera quality. It is like 2 megapixel camera. Photos are very worst. If you slightly zoom the photo,  you can see blurry...Previously I used 13 megapixel amera phone. Those photos are very good."
1,"No 5Ghz wifi band on this mobile, miserable in 2021 , even my previous mobile of Samsung which I bought in 2017 have 5Ghz wifi , it's a big comedy"
1,Don't received  handset ejection  pin  and manual.
5,Just unboxed the phone.Seems to be a better one in this price segment as of now.Just checked with the camera & voice it seems good but one thing it's very heavy in weight may be due to battery.Hope samsung lives upto expectation.
1,very poor build qualityvery poor camera piclow quality phoneno return policyvery worst mobilejust making fool to customer by samsung m12 and Amazon
1,Hitting issue
1,Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don't waste money on this product.
1,"Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price."
5,"This is perfect phone, good speed, decent specs and outstanding battery life. The look of the device is also attractive. Above all, the trust of company."
1,"PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
1,"Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don't buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI."
1,Dislike
2,"Product specifications are not at par..Display is below average.Camera quality is just okay..It doesnt support 5ghz wifi, which is not mentioned anywhere so please make sure before buying.."
1,Self camera is just like 2 mega pixels.
1,"The user experience is pathetic on these cheap phones. Its filled to the brim with bloatware that you can't remove.You're better off getting the Mi phones as they have a far better UIAlso, I can't return this garbage of a phone as Samsung don't list this as a software issue.I'll have to look into installing lineage os and de-google this phone before using it but that's easier said than done."
1,Just for name sake Cam & Battery are 48mp & 6000mah. But coming to reality it is poor. The weight of the phone also almost 250gm so it is not a smart phone it is a hard phone. And the top menu bar beside front cam is not responding sometimes.
5,"A very satisfying  experience with the device so  far.Pros:1. Long battery life-  I am a moderate  user who does everything  except gaming. That said , the battery lasts up to 2 full days.2. Decent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.3. Very responsive finger print sensor.4. Good sound quality, although dolby's impact  is not much pronounced5. UI is great and snappy. Lots of customization options.6. The display is good and smooth with 90hz refresh rate. It does make the difference.7. Fast charging works fine.Cons:1. The weight of the phone is on the heavier side @ 220 gms2. The display could have been a full HD+ @ 1080p3. No led notification light. All though there are apps that can do the job on an AMOLED screen.Overall, a good package."
1,Horrible product
1,"Not a good mobile.Quite heavy in weight, you will obviously feel it. Weight is 220 gms which is far exceeding acceptable range. Can definitely be used as paperweight.Nothing special in screen, processor or camera also.Just a marketing gimmick by samsung.Stay away.. At 13.5k we deserve far better than this."
3,Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn‚Äôt give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you‚Äôre choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you‚Äôll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review
4,I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1. Battery and Camera.1. BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non sense.I played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98% to 80 %2. Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this
1,Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp
1,"This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information."
5,"It's a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they're wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it üòå. Once again no complains regarding anything."
1,Look is average. Battery life is good. Only go ahead if you just need a good brand name otherwise 100 of options are available in market. You will definitely get disappointed with camera which is actually not more than 12 mega pixels.  This phone nothing but a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached. Samsung must call back these phones as it is definitely going to kill the brand name. I will highly appreciate if Amazon has the guts to publish this review. This is an open challenge to Amazon...
2,"The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box"
4,"Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage .  I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck .Awesome battery life , and that's what I want . I am just using it for basic social media and calls .. rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device .CAMERA is average , My ipad's 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called ""true"" 48MP.My advice-- go for 6gb variant as 2.5 gb is acquired by the system .Overall - 4‚òÜ"
1,"Disappointed with this mobile.... PhonePay & GooglePay apps are not working properly.... Numbers visible only half and getting overlapped....and we're end up typing wrong Pin numbers.... multiple times we have changed the Pin for these apps... now a days We regularly use mobile for online payments but this mobile is not useful for online payments due to app issues.We have tried to return this mobile, but Amazon return policy date was over by the time we found the issue."
5,I am using this phone for the last one week and i noticed few positive and negative things about it.Positive points -‚Ä¢ Fingerprint sensor is so fast and i loved it‚Ä¢ Battery backup (6000 mAh) is amazing even after using it throughout the day‚Ä¢ Camera quality is really good and the pictures are amazing on day light‚Ä¢ Large display having a size of 6.5 inches and can run games smoothly on low graphic settings‚Ä¢ 90Hz refresh rate feels so smooth‚Ä¢ The phone doesn't lag or get heated after using it for a long time because of Exynos 850 (8nm) high-end processorNegative points -‚Ä¢ Not made for hard-core gaming because the processor is not strong enough to run games smoothly on high graphics‚Ä¢ The weight of phone is heavy‚Ä¢ The brightness level is somewhat low as compared to other phones‚Ä¢ The display that you will get is around 720 x 1600 pixels‚Ä¢ The downloading as well as uploading speed is also low as compared to other phones within this price range‚Ä¢ It is not water resistant and does not have Gorilla glass for screen protection .~ I am satisfied with this phone because of it's camera quality and battery backup ‚àö
5,"Brilliant camera, huge battery life and brilliant display in addition with the premium feeling of SAMSUNG. It's a shame that this phone's launch was delayed due to lockdown.Highly Recommended phone üòäüòä"
5,As a title it is obviously a monsterAnd very very good performance
3,"I am writing my review after using it for 6 days.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range."
1,"Very poor performance. Hangs aloft. Even I don't use any gaming app. In browsing only, this phone lacks. Inspite of having 6 GB RAM. This product serves zero rating. Please don't buy  this. Wastage of money. No refund policy for this device."
5,"Its a one season wonder. All was good till the one year mark.I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great for one year. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I was more than satisfied TILL ONE YEAR.After the one year and two month mark the phone started to automatically restart and freeze every 5 minutes of usage. Went to Samsung care and they said the motherboard has issues and need to be replaced and asked me to pay Rs 8000 since the warranty period was over. To my surprise the issue was not only with my phone. Many M21 buyers had the same issue, although some were lucky enough to have replaced the motherboard in warranty period.So my point is this phone is not a Rs 14499 phone instead it is a Rs 14499 + Rs 8000 phone if you want it to use it more than 1 year. In brief it is a Rs 22499 phone. You can get better phones in this price range.AVOID AT ALL COST"
2,Even realme performs better.....few issues which concerned me after use were1. When recording slow motion videos...there is  always flicker on screen.2. fingerprint sensor needs more than few attempts to work3. Camera is better than realme but not as good as redmi4. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming5. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone6. Mobile data connection vanishes many times in a day...I thought it was my airtel network .....but the same sim works on my old volte phone...without any issue....Suggestions for people who have bought this phone.....Since company does not provides a screen guard..... Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early...Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone.....If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....I am attaching two videos one in normal mode.....second in slow mode.....both videos are made by m21......you can see the flikr effect in second video easily..
5,Very Nice Mobile good all
1,Heating problem. In simple browising only phone gets heated up in upper side. When asking for replacement amazon customer care they are fooling us. Very pathetic condition.
1,"The phone(M21 Raven Black) is not working properly since its purchase. After the first installation, it is on frequently on and off mode and even restarts after more than 30 minutes. Moreover 4-5 times it takes more than 2 hours for starting.I also register a complaint to Amazon regarding this. I don't need such a disgusting phone any more. it wastes my 3 days. So, I request to Amazon kindly refund my money, I don't need replacement."
5,Just one word AMAZING
1,Now Amazone has REPLACED THE DAMAGED ONE NOW THE PHONE IS GOOD ENOUGH...PREVIOUS ONE WAS Nonsence What A Nonsence Battery It Comes to 90% Charge After a full charge only if u do something in10 minutes.... What nonsence is this. NEED REPLACEMENT. Do you people think customers are Mad.
1,"After 5 hrs continuously  charging level reach 55 %,during call sound quality not clear,a lot of heating problem,camera quality not good,network issue,slow processing..poor performance"
1,Heating problems
1,Otg pendrive not supported
1,"This phone's video,photo quality and audio quality is very poor"
5,"I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.üòÄ"
1,"Samsung m21 Mobile not in the delivery box, only charger and pin are available. Need refund for the same.For mobiles, its better to opt for cash on delivery, to avoid getting cheated."
4,"Looks like just to clear the unsold stock of m30s they gave it a new name and advertised it as a totally new phone. Everything is similar to m30s, except the price (and selfie camera). Good thing is that they kept the price low.Just got it delivered today. So far so good, many users compalined about battery, charging speed, display issues on m30s. Hope they got it resolved in m21."
1,Samsung Co. Claims that Samsung M21 has fast charging facility and It has 6000 mAh battery but these two claims are totally bogus because I've purchased Samsung M21 and received my order yesterday after using this phone I plugged in charger for charging it took approximate 9 hours to charge the Mobile phone and after full charging approximate 2 hours the Mobile phone battery get reduced 50%. I'm totally disappointed with this phone.
4,A nice looking phone.Light weight because of the plastic body. Performance is pretty good.But it doesn't feel like a 6000 mAh battery. Probably a little shy of that figure. It Drains relatively quickly than what is expected of a 6000 mAh capacity.But overall a product worth it's price. Probably not good for high performance gaming.But expect it to be durable with a low-medium usage.
1,"Don't like this product. It looks, it's already used by someone else. Apps are not downloading. It shows 6 appsare downloading. I'm confused."
3,"It charges very slowly, though they claim that it has fast charging?Has anyone else also facing this issue?"
1,Amazon delivered a defective phone to me and then they don't even receive my call while I tried to approach them.  Buying Samsung Galaxy M21 is waste of money.
1,1. I bought this to gift it to my dear one but I am shocked to see the camera quality of this phone is like 1 mb. I tried all the modes but it enhances the photo brightness automatically and and the photo becomes like a cartoon.2. Tried installing other camera apps but still the quality is poor.3. Tried options for returning but found that there is no option for that.4. Spoke to customer care and they say that they can only replace if the product is damaged and no option for quality related issues. I said that I am ready to buy any other product too. But no response from them.It‚Äôs better to buy from local store than going behind Amazon.
5,Value for money
1,What can I say just after 30 min.of recieving this phone I applied for return my money. Before this phone I already have 2 phone of Samsung's working good but this phone made in India is hot like a oven.I can't take it near my ears .I have to use ear phone.I call customer care they give me different different idea but problem remain same.I don't give advice to buy this product to any one be careful.
3,"I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21.The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED displayThe issues I faced are1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP).4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging.Among all these issues I believe it is an average deal under 13k"
4,"I like the camera quality, screen sensitivity,  and browsing experience. The speed is excellent.I don't like it's sound. The speaker is not the best, sometimes when I put on loud speaker the person I am speaking to will complain they cannot hear me. Plus when I play music the sound is not the best. Also, the phone does not come with original earphones so you have to hustle for that. Lastly it will take 3 hours to charge and still the battery will only last for 24hours."
5,"Display good, battery  performance  after one  week  of use has improved,camera is good,hope Samsung  provides  regular  updates..Excellent  phone  keep good  work  up Samsung üëå"
1,Battery  drain quickly... and phone heat a lot.
1,recently i ordered samsung M21 6GB RAM 128GB Flash.Unboxed and started the phone. it surprised to see so much of heated while booting itself.I tried to inform to Amazon . they tested with some remote diagnostics application surprisingly it showed the temperature is degree.I am using Samsung phones long time. this time my experience with M21 is very very badNew buyers please little careful about heating issue
1,Giving only one star because it compulsory. Sensor not working and heating fast
5,"Realy very very good phone,but stil I did not get,due to covid"
1,Received Samsung M 21 yesterday..highly disappointed  about slow charging and poor quality of camera..did not expect this from Samsung.I suggest not to buy this mobile.
5,I got this phone 11249. Best Display best Battery Good camera and Samsung BrandingSo people must buy this phone this price.Other phone can't beat
4,"Amazing phone But m not satisfied with camera quality, its 48MP? I used samsung galaxy S8 its only 12MP single camera which is good for m21 tripple camera.One more thing is back panel is plastic which is not good looking inthis range ..Its not feel premium with this budget...."
2,"I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s.M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacksM21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50sBattery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick.Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage.Pros:Super amoled screen6000 MaH batteryCons:Signal strength is very poor.(You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app)Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc"
1,Worst Phone I have seen specs amd buyed it but not satisfied I have samsung m21 mobile which has amoled screen and always on display same they mentioned in this Redmi Note 10s but display clarity is worst than LCD and always on display stays only for 10 sec  .Worst Camera Performnace wise ok Didnt liked this phone and dont trap for technical gimmiks.
3,"All is well but photo quality is very bad. Note 7,9 series is better than note 10s. It's camera need to work on it. It is not capture the details of the photo like previous model of redmi. 48mp camera of Redmi note 9 is very very good than 64mp camera of Redmi note 10s"
4,Good
4,"Phone is tooo good.Battery life is for 15-20 days.Paise toh maine girlfriend se udhar liye hai, wo toh bol rahe hai ki lautane ki jarurat nai hai. Par uss pagli ko ye nai pata ki main sach mein dene wala nai hu.Phone toh mere biwi se bhi halka hai.Baaki camera thoda aur acha hona chaiye tha, wo kya hai na mera ek kaala dost hai uske photo ke liye sarre filter laga ke dekhe, par wo bechara abhi bhi kaala aata hai.Baaki sab mast hai."
1,"I ordered this phone, Redmi note 10s has network signal problem. the voice will break always. I contacted the customer support, i had bought this using 10% off. they are not replacing the phone and asking me to order the phone which is at higher price now. they are saying you can give the review whereever you want. they dont even care about the customer. dont order this product. its waste of money"
1,Don't buy. First ever Redmi product and it's disappointing. Screen doesn't light up when someone calls. (Check attached picture).Fingerprint scanner takes ages and many attempts to respond.Front camera is one of the worst that I have seen in recent times.I don't understand how come such a big company can release a product without proper R&D.
1,Camera quality is very Poor and Display it was saying that Super AMOLED display but it was not worth for it
5,"It's simply superb don't trust any other comments do trust my comment and its genuine comment ,in this price it's best best phone I ever seen"
1,No any front light (indicator) for charging miss call or massage battery life not good medium use one day life back side is  vary slippy display is ok ok
1,"I purchased this mobile on 24th April with in 2 days i returned this mobile because i had a issue with hearing the opposite person voice. and received a replacement 11th June on that phone i had camera issue.When i open the camera it will automatically get closed and came to back to home screen hence i again returned. Now they said they will refund the amount. This is totally un acceptable.Never expected such a poor service from Amazon and never expected these issues in Redmi mobiles really very much disappointed.Friends, please don't go for this model its my humble request, Thanks"
1,I bought this phone there is a major problem in network issue I have already returne one phone they give me another one but like same I recommend it to everyone do not buy this  model üëç
3,Google Play store not working. Took one whole day for all the apps and info to be downloaded and finally had to do it through GET APPS option of MI phone. Had to transfer data thru MI MOVER.FABULOUS camera.
2,This phone doesn't have automatic call Recorder and when I Record call manually its loudly announce  your call has been recording  I tried many applications for recording but I'm unable to record call without announcements  so if anybody want to Record calls  so please don't buy thi mobileAnd also I purchased this mobile with no cost EMI but they are charged me 17%interest  its bad experience with Amazon
1,Having problem with speakers in new redmi 10S phone which I purchased...  basic functionality calls not working properly at all - voice is not at all clear in between cut cut.... infact If we spend 1000 rupees & go for basic mobile  incoming & outgoing calls facility works awesome. But Redmi10S worst. Also the Redmi service center response is pathetic they are not approachable & do not accept the issue what we are facing even if we are coming up with proof. they say we have formatted software & no issue is found also they no replacement  & more over they don't even give any statement in writing verbally say no issue. We do get proof any proof for visiting Redmi service center. worst experience I faced spending 15K & buying Redmi 10S mobile. I suggest not to go for Redmi Mobile as I could see during my visit to service center many people visiting center with newly purchased mobile having one or the other issue... I will never ever suggest anybody to go for Redmi.
1,"Please try not to buy this model because I used all the models from Redmi. This is not at all working good.The first mobile after returning(due to Network and High Temperature issue) I got another 10S but this one too is a faulty one. apps hanging, camera not good , battery draining off quickly in stand by mode. I purchased this one by reading positive reviews but u will feel regret after buying this one. don't waste money try different model. always love amazon delivery speed and packing was not good for this product. Seller was also responsive. but fate mobile is a failure model."
1,"Very owful experience first time with Amazon , Bought this for some one's gift but , Camera performance very poor in front camera and rear camera . It's latest vision and quality of Camera very poor don't know it's defective phone received or not !! and replacement is always not available and technician also not available I m very very desapointed with the service and product"
1,"Dear Sir / Madam,I am writing to you to raise an issue about: Mobile Phone and accessoriesThe issue that I have experienced was: I have booked a new mobile ( Redmi Note 10 S ) dated 9th-June-2021 from Amazon and received its delivery on dated 11th-June-2021, When i start using it, I faced a voice disturbance issue initially, I cross-checked my mobile network sim car by placing it in my old phone but there is no connectivity or network issue in my sim cardThen  I tried to reach Xiaomi via their website to customer care & emailed my issue but still, there is no such positive response from their side and still, I am facing such issue"
5,Experience is going through. Almost good üòä
1,"Very bad camera quality,Front camera-in night front camera is like vga camera,no details in picture.Back camera-in daylight if capture a photo no details is seen,if u zoom the image every part of the pic is blurrVideo camera -my previous realme u1 was far ahed of this that was only 13 mp camera.Front camera-1/5Back camera-1/5Video -1/5Processor is also bad pubg in smooth and ultra settings the phn is heating too tooo tooo much."
1,After 10 days of use i am sharing experience. Incoming Audio is not clearPhotos are not natural at allFinger touch westAutorotate sensor not at allworking. You need to do manually.West product. This should less than 7k
1,"I can't imagine that this is Redmi phone, I am using Redmi brand from last 6 years and this is my third mobile set of Redmi.I am not satisfied and even suggest to others, don't buy any redmi more then 10k and above, its not working well in most of the parameters, so only purchase les. Then 10k price Redmi mobile, don't go much higher.I am totally dissatisfied with my latest Redmi note 10 S, if MI company give me chance I will pay and purchase Redmi 10 pro...I would not prefer 10S.So be care....."
5,"The phone is overall very impressive. After my first few days of basic usage, I can that it is smooth and fast with no lag. The camera is impressive in this price range. The UI is also nice and easy to use. Battery is good but not amazing. The sleek and lightweight build adds on to the value. On the whole I would say Redmi Note 10S is worth the penny.Review is based on first week of usage only."
1,I got the phone delivered from amazon and charged it. Within 15 mins it overheated like an portable iron box. Then I requested for a refund but Amazon scheduled a technician visit then I got a replacement. It had the same issue. Now they issued a refund. The build quality of the phone is bad which is causing battery issues. I won‚Äôt recommend anyone buying this device.
1,Poor camera quality. Don't buy this product.I have used real me xt before and it's camera quality was awesome. But redmi has a very bad camera quality comparing to real me... Not worth of money.
1,"I have compared the phone with a much lesser price Redmi note 10, In almost all factors the RMN10 is better. Am not a gaming person. Even using the camera the phone was heating. Am disappointed in buying this device. One of the worst phones I have bought from Redmi.  I have buying Redmi phones since 2015, till now I have bought 8 Redmi phones. This is the only phone was disappointed.Selfie camera in low light is pathetic.64 MB camera performers are inconsistent. Some pics are good"
1,"Not everyone purchase this phone for installing custom OS.. You need to change, you need to improve your OS..."
4,"Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more"
5,"I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera."
1,Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
4,If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
5,"Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."

4,"I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
3,"COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"
1,"Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. üòû. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone üì±, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% üòÄ. The phone is too lightweight ‚ò∫Ô∏è and very handyüòÑ Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. üòÉ.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. üò≠GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. üò†üò†.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. üò•. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good üëçBut it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. üò†Display quality is too poor. üò´ Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. ü•∫  No led in front of the display.üò∞Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection üò•If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or aboveü§ó with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy."
1,"Compass is not working, showing error as required sensor are not available,And everything is fine."
1,Made in china...The country of origin should be mentioned in the description...Returning the Chinese crap
3,Made in China product
5,"Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
3,Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
2,Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
5,It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
5,"Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
3,Weary good product  very fast delivery
5,"Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
4,"Good mobile,in this corona times if we want quality product for basic regular usage,this Redmi 9a 3 gb /32 bestCamera is average like all entry-level mobiles,Redmi might send an update for small big fixes like every new mobile launch,gcam till now not available,with that quality of camera increasesDesign display very good,slim tall mobileBattery very good,takes 2.5 hours for full charge,so better charge when 40 % battery left.People who are planning to buy 4 gb /64 gb Redmi 9a,don't take it ,best to go for Redmi 9 as we get finger print scanner, slightly better speed,camera and build quality for just 700rs moreSpeed of Redmi 9a is good for 3- 4 appsCons:No gorilla glass protectionNo Secondary noise cancelling mic,this is big mistake by redmi as they give in every mobileNo Finger print scannerFinally under 10,000 rs all Redmi 9 series mobiles are very best as they provide 4 gb ram variant in very price segment,only option we have"
2,Phone is good. But it is made in China
5,Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
1,"I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available. You can replace only. So, please don't buy this worst product. Even for first time im facing that amazon support also not supporting in this issue. I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."
3,"Purchased the 3gb variant of redmi 9a. Following is the review based on 1day of usageProsDisplay and battery backupOuter designLatest Android 10 based miui 12Back cover looks sturdy (less chances of falling off your hand)ConsPolycarbonate back cover vibrates when phone is on full volumeNo fast charging, takes 2 hr 45 minutes to fully chargeNo notification light (a big bummer)No Gorilla glass protectionNo fingerprint sensor however face unlock works fineVerdictA decent entry level phone however no need to exchange if u r using redmi 8a. If you can squeeze in a few more bucks, then there are many good phone for 9k."
4,"So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5‚≠ê for thatPros-‚Ä¢Low price, wont get any other phones in this range‚Ä¢ Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.‚Ä¢Good for basic usage.‚Ä¢Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:‚Ä¢camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)‚Ä¢Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use‚≠ê"
3,A little bit slow..I think it will more lagged afterwards..Big screen.Camera is not good.. As well as selfie..Ph is For normal users..

5,Camera is not good and  all is well
5,Worth a price taking this phone.Good specifications and must buy product.Affordable.A suggestion for everyone do buy this one.
5,"One of the best phone to use in this price range, best features and value to money phone, this phones comes with great battery back up as well."
2,1) very slow operating.2) camera not good.3) selfie camera not happy.4) Alexa app not inbuilt.Overall it's a face mobile by amazon.I am feeling so bad for I have activated amazon Prime for this mobile.
1,Very bad product. Camera quality is worst. Also display quality is wrost.I want to return Or replace but customer service not allowed to do the same. I recommend do not buy this product. It's not worth to invest 13k
4,"It's a good , overall it's good for normal users,use of 5g technology downgraded the camera (cost cutting) ,may the punch hole in front could be smaller ,but the look of the phone is very great it's feels excellent in hand,those who need 5g for budget can rely on this"
1,Worst üëéüëéüëé
3,"At first looks, its seems high end phone.Surprisingly no touch sensorWorst part that you can use either sim card or sd card in 2nd sim slot, it is no where mentioned in technical specs...Will use and share further information later"
2,Camera is not upto mark. If you will compare with other redmi phones below 10k ranges.
1,Phone is not so good as expected just say one word thik thak
5,"This product is good, it's ultra slim, though it's having 8mp front camera, photo quality is nice...But for other viewers of this reviews, I'm only telling that if you setup fingerprint, doo set it up on pressing, else you'll end up like me factory resetting the device in it showing maximum fingerprint attempts reached, the phone is locked..."
1,It's a worst phone
3,2 Megapixel Wala Mobile Bhi Acha Clarity Deta hai
2,"I can't imagine this worst ever product, poorest camera quality, front even worst. Lot of grains coming in images. Don't know why they are saying fast charging, it's ordinary charge, taking 2 hours to charge. Sound quality is poor, my four year vivo phone is still louder than this. Pathetic device ever"
1,"Very disappointed with Redmi.The phone with such third class features doesn't even deserve to be priced 15999/- ..... Total waste of money.... And there's not even return policy.. ..Camera quality sucks, not smooth enough...such a disappointment it is..."
1,"Please do not buy this phone because of price,5g and alexa.The phone has lot of complaints like heating while charging and for using continuously 30mns, hanging problem and slow processor not good camera no fast charging it takes more than 2 hrs for full charge.Finger print not up to mark finally there is no return option  only replacement and  support for replacement is worst."
1,"Waste of money, too many ads and background services. Please don't purchase MIUI PHONES and that too on AMAZON."
2,I will not recommend this phone. Nothing is good here except 5G which cannot be verified now. Battery is poor. Display is average and both camera are very poor. Alexa is not inbuilt. I have decided not to buy xiaomi phone any more. Repending very much for buying two phones. I should have bought Samsung instead.
2,"Received phone on 29th July‚Ä¶ Initially everything was good but after normal usage of almost 2 hours phone hanged and got very hot and camera quality is very pathetic, and while many apps were not respond properly like Paytm and Amazon. Returned the product on next day itself‚Ä¶ Not worth of it."
2,Display quality bad camera quality also bad Mobile heating not worth this price
3,"Dislike: Fake Promotion for Alexa Inbuilt, Fake Promotion for 2 Sim Card Slots. Camera is average quality. Battery draining fast for a new phone of MI category. Just because of few sales... MI is tarnishing it's brand name. Compensate us with updated software immediately or replace the phone. What is this... U can't play with customer trust just like ths, even paid for the phone at one go.. is ths how MI treats customer these days?  I can assure ths to MI ths is my first & last MI phone and I will proactively recommend other users to snub MI unless massive software upgrade is there."
1,"Dear all,Appearance on front side of the product not upto mark.previously i have poco m2 pro tat is far better than this in performance and in specificationsPlease dont go for this product, only thing is 5g and tempting in flash sales. This product is not upto mark.Totally dissatisfied after using the product for 2 days.H Naidu"
2,Phone looks good but audio is not clear
5,"So one week has finally over, now I guess I am ready for the review. Even after seeing so many negative reviews, I still bought it, and I don't regret, I don't understand why many people hated it, I guess it is just some petty ""Boycott Chinese Stuff"", cause I really don't face any issues. But then again don't expect too much because you are not paying excessive amount. I decided to write both PROS and CONS together.Great battery life. Even if you play games like me, I play Genshin Impact, graphics and storage is higher than Free Fire and PubG, yet it doesn't consume too much charge, I can easily play up to 5 hours with 20%-30% charge decreases.Fresh rate is also very noticing, my mobile don't freeze even if I play for 6 hours then browse in social sites. I tried to use it as much as I can for 3 days still no damage in battery life or game experiences.I really like the back camera, though I won't suggest it if you are looking for a phone because of photography, still the back camera is very nice. Selfie camera is average, or maybe a bit lower, still okay for me. I won't show any photo cause privacy issues.MIUI was 12 when it reached my home but in between 2 hours it asked for update so this phone indeed has MIUI 12.5 stable version. Which makes the phone unique internally.A lot of daily used apps are pre-installed but you can uninstall and reinstall as your preference, I don't need Facebook, so I deleted it and it actually got deleted from the phone, normally this types of apps don't delete either they just shut down or stay right there, so this is why I like this phone.Although the phone hasn't AMOLED display but trust me in you want, there is no difference for it, the display is still vibrant and beautiful, but a bit blueish, you can notice it only in Dark Mode if you got a excellent pair of eyes.Since it is 5G set, so generally it has more antennas, hence a strong connection even in a deserted place. And for this mobile I do agree that 4G sim card work better in 5G phones.Lastly, a lot people complaint that it doesn't have dual sim, actually it do, but if you put dual Sim, you can't install SD card, cause 1st sim slot is normal slot but second one is hybrid, you can either fit sim or fit card. Though I believe 128GB is too much of storage if you don't store any video with long duration.(1 hour- 10 hours)So at the end, it is my best phone. I really like it."
1,"Worst of Battery backup, drained within 5-6 hours after full charged. Front camera resolution is very bad. Back panel body heat up too much after 60-70% battery charged.If you complaint about problem in customer care so they booked a technical person for home visit but technician didn‚Äôt visit to home and try to solve your problem on telephonically and marked mobile condition Okay without check mobile physically."
1,"Battery does not sustain even for a day, 5000 MAH battery is just for the sake of name.Camera clarity is also not upto mark, Alexa also does not work properly.Not worth buying..."
1,"Front camera is terrible, like VGA camera. The phone doesn't feel smooth even on normal usage. Better go for some other mobile without 5g in this price range. No one would have expected such a third rated mobile for 16k. Totally not worth the money. The best part is, I couldn't request for a return."
5,Dual sim but expandable memory with one sim only. No extra slot for memory card. Otherwise mobile is good.
1,"Phone started hanging on first day itself. Camera is not at all good. No picture clarity even in rear camera. Battery backup is bad.I personally did not like Redmi UI. It has lot of flaws and yet to cover long way to compete with Samsung or Stock Android user experience.I won't recommend to throw away 15K for this Chinese phone. Go for Samsung blindly for mid range phones. Or if you can extend your budget upto 30k, go for Google Pixel phones. They are amazing on every front. You get iPhone kind of premium experience with Pixel."
1,"Worst camera at this high cost, common slot for 2nd sim and memory card, Wifi network and mobile network is weak compared to how it worked for previous phone, etc etc...Even my Moto G2 of year 2014 have better front and rear camera quality then this phone.Prefer to add Rs 5k more and buy oneplus basic model."
1,Wrost product both cameras are not good it's not worth to pay 15k I think mi 9 is better then note 10TAm trying to replace
2,"I think these people have made the rest of the thing too weak just to give 5G phones.Plus point:1) Low budget 5G phone2) Battery life is sufficient3) Smooth Handling PhoneNagative Point:1) Camera image quality is worst (both front and rear).2) Display quality is bad and doesn't actually give real color. (Even if you set a refresh rate of 90 MHz)3) After 1 minute video recording, the phone is getting very heat.4) Lots of Un-useful apps where you can't uninstall.5) The phone camera function is too simple and does not offer many options. AI is not working actually.6) They offer a approximately 20W fast charger but the phone does not charge quickly.7) Hybrid SIM slot, you cannot use both SIMs with memory card."
1,"Not very much satisfied with camera quality, speed is also low and sometimes screen sticks also. Only plus point is it's 5G which is not very relevant as of now."
1,Camera is worst. I don't understand how do they measure it as 48megapixel. This is one of the worst mobile for camera. Don't buy it if you are looking for camera. Rest is good. Need some third party review before buying such phones on launch.
5,Love ‚ù§it
5,very comfortable in my hands...I am happy these products...Thanks  Redmi üåπüåπ
5,"Pros:5G90Hz display48MP camera, Macro 2xC type chargerIR blaster, 3.5mm jack, AlexaLimitations because of price band-18w chargerno AMOLED display but 90hz is really smoothA great starter phone at this price."
3,The camera picture quality is very low.... It's not look like 48 megapixel.....I specially order this phone for pics but not worth it...Its a average phone doesn't meet my expectations... Better go for Oppo 5g phone for better picture quality....not recommended redmi 10t 5g for purchase.
4,Before buying this product I was thinking whether I have to buy this phone or not after so many negative reviews but finally I purchased and now I'm satisfied with redmi note 10T...Camera quality is not good nor bad...Battery life is also satisfactory...It have Dual app option on app->manage app option and is working fine.Alexa is also working fine now but not worked first time... Done some investigation to make alexa work...Sound quality is also nice...Purchased on independence day sale 10 Aug 2021.Till now it's working fine.Will share more after using it...
1,Received buplicate charger
2,The phone is good. But not satisfied with its software. It does not have facility of all call recording. Also it notifies missed call frequently even if you have noticed it. As it's my practice to give my review onlyafter several use. The more problem with software i will show whenever I see it.
1,"The worst front camera ever given by redmi. I have been a costumer since the production of redmi note 3 and this ia by far the worst camera experience ever. Also, it took me a lot while to realise that the vibration motor is not the same as redmi note 9 pro. They should mention such details in the description atleast, bit there was not detail of haptic driver in this device"
4,The phone is very much nice. Everything I found is Good in this category. The only thing which is disrupting the quality is MIUI.
1,"This version of Jio mobile is worse than the previous one. It takes time to load features, and the battery is not so powerful. It should not be purchased. It is very expensive when we consider its features."
1,"Pleae dont buy this phone, on the first time itaelf not switching on, Not sure why the these guys are selling defective cheap product to poor people for the Money, one of the worst mobile phone is Jio 3 phone."
1,Don't buy this mobile...... Worst ever
2,Jio sim use only one day battery backup total waste of money product
1,Battery remains for 1 day ....if phone is not even touched ......poor batteryNo wifiCamera is decent
2,The quality of this product is poor. The buttons are not good. The built quality is also poor.
1,Dont buy this product. Very low quality and not working properly.
4,Meet expectations
5,Sabse bekar aur ghathiya mobile phone hai. aur uper se paisa bhi jayada le Raha haiEk kahawat hai chori to chori uper se sinajori.
1,Front camara worrest
1,Don't buy this phone
2,disappointment from front camera performance below average very bad performance. and then everything is average
1,"Front camera is worst , I doubt does it really have a 50 MP Rear camera  ...after 2 days of using mobile , YouTube was not responding , and many such apps weren't responding named Music , Gallery etc"
3,Front camera is not working properly. The image and video is blur.
1,Sim slot is not working
1,"Firstly camera quality is not upto mark.Mobile get hang, while accessing any applications call applications will get disappear from the screen when mobile get hang.....don't buy this mobile phone this is  my personal suggestion."
2,"Please must read my review before u buying, now I am using redmi note 10 , I bought note 10 for 14k(6+128), it is great value for money, but redmi 10 prime cost is 12.5k (4+64)  which is very very high price according to its quality of features, front camera captures like 5mp, it is not an 8mp camera, even back camera 50 mp also captures washed out pictures, in the camera department completely utterflap redmi this time, charging time is very long because of battery 6000mah , display is not upto the mark but ok, sound output is good, only main speaker is loud and other is low sound, call quality ok, design good, I had used redmi note 8 before redmi note 10, it is the best value for money under 10k But now redmi 10 prime is not upto the mark for this price, please go to note 10 don't buy redmi 10 prime"
4,Front camera is not optimised and up to the mark back camera is not optimised.Performance is average . Display quality good.Sound quality superb. Bigger battery gives boosts . Some minor glitches that can be fixed afterwards through updates. Overall good for normal usage .
1,Totally waste of money and camera quality is very bad and processer is not good
5,Nothing to dislike.. Everything good
4,Received phone today.. Quite nice phone. Need to learn how to take pictures with 50mb cam.. All good
5,"Battery backup was nice. Yes it does take a bit longer to charge, but at least in my case that wasn't a problem.Camera was nice unlike the other comments I read before I bought the phone. There are some problems though. The fingerprint sensor is terrible. Sometimes it just wouldn't open (that happens rarely but it does happen) and I would have to put the pin manually.Design looks great, display looks great. I didn't face any brightness issues outdoors so no regret of buying it.The stereo speakers are just fine, and so far the phone never heated up after charging or game usage.It ticked all my boxes."
4,"Outstanding device.The phone design is so premium, but actually it's plastic body. The phone comes with amazing features and great processor in it's price range. In this budget segment I've used Samsung and Realme devices also. But, this Redmi 10 Prime is best among them.The only cons is that the camera is not upto the mark and if you're not regular Redmi phone user then you will have to modify lot of things in this device to make it handy."
1,"Its very simple, ""I shouldn't have bought this mobile"""
5,overall very nice product
5,Excellent mobile phoneExcellent cameraGood battery lifeExcellent displayAll things are excellent in the mobile go for it ....
1,Wrost phone plzz not buy waste of money camera quality is very bad only features showen highlightly but they or not according to as they are shown 50 mg camera like 13 megapixel selfie camera is wrost in light mode you feel camera is wrost dark photos are click
5,"Posting review after 12 days if use.The phone is absolutely gorgeous! The body is plastic but the quality is not compromised. Tempered glass was already applied and the touch works with even a featherlight touch. Moving between apps is extremely fluid. I'm not much of a games, but the candy Crush works fine.The camera is beyond my expectation. Many reviews sat it's not good, but I found the picture quality and effects to be at par with sony camera.Only thing I don't like is the missing notification indicator. I miss important and urgent messages due to its absence. Apart from that, the best phone I've personally used!"
5,Best in the market till nowPrevious I had a Note 7 pro that was too fabulousNow I own a 10 primeü§©ü§©ü§©
1,"So many issues with this model, I have used many mi phones but this is the fist time I have faced so many issues with this model, fist of all about camera, front camera is very poor clarity, 2nd is wifi signal strength receiving is also poor, so many lags in miui 12.5, contact & dailing Google app has so many issues, mi dailing & contact's was very good and user friendly why I don't know that was changed to Google app, I didn't like Google contact app and it has so many issues, and there are so many software issues in 12.5 update also. I am a big fan of mi products & after using this model I changed my mind & want to shift to other company. In that way the phone model has impacted me. Finally I sincere suggestion you don't buy this model if you are using this phone for video calls at least."
1,"Please don't buy these cheap and worst camera mobile. Company claims 1st 50 MP camera , which takes picture worse than 5 mp camera. Need explanation from Amazon for giving wrong information to customers and cheating with seller. I'll give -5 for camera quality"
1,The camera stands out and is a bit better when compared with a VGA cam on a feature phone.

1,"78k for a plastic back,does samsung think people are that stupid.samsung is seriously out of its mind for pricing this phone so high."
1,78k for plastic back + outdated exynos + 60 hz 1080p display + no 5gExynos 990 also has heating issues.It should be priced around 50k.

1,"OLD MOBILE GIVEN WITH  FAULTY , PLEASE RETURN IT AND REFUND MY MONEY, I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH  AMAZONE SERVICE, NOW IT WILL EFECT TO AMAZONE REPUTATION , PARTNET GIVING OLD GOODS, PLEASE CARE AND TAKE"
5,"Owning a Note Series has always been an exciting feeling. And the discounted price is a cherry on the cake!So I bought this for the S Pen and the beautiful display. People who complain about plastic back at this hefty price, don't know what it feels to have a glass back break into a million pieces. If you have a butter fingers, plastic saves! And most importantly everything at this price ends up in a good Spigen case anyway.Also not having a 120 Hz or 90 Hz display doesn't bother me. Days are already busy wfh and I hardly notice the difference. Also 5G, we don't have that kinda tech here in India. So no point buying the Ultra either.Display and Camera are good, that's Samsung USP.Getting a decent battery life considering I have been playing alot many games and using the S Pen a lot.All in all a very happy Samsung Boy!Peace! ‚úå"
1,Worst battery life. Doesn't last half day.Received fake product with tampered box no user manual and no ejection pin.Pathetic customer service. Not ready to refund money or help in anyway
1,I bought samsung note 20 for my brother as a diwali gift which got delivered yesterday. And today by a mere fall the s pen broke into pieces. Now i know why many reviewers wrote about the plastic body.
4,"Excellent screen & speed, enjoying the experience. Felt slight heating issue and average camera result in zoom mode. Normal mode camera performance is awesome."
5,"The product is definitely good. The delivery through Amazon was fast and as desired. However, the packaging could have been a bit better from Amazon side.Only regret I have is that Samsung came out with a discount offer immediately after the launch. I feel its unfair for the loyal customers. The discount should have been announced either at least after 3-4 months or the benefit should have been passed on to prebooking customers as well."
1,"Seller has cheated;Used phone has been delivered, clear sign of previous use, Missing accessories - Like, Extra tip for stylus & it‚Äôs clip for replacement.Headphone has been also previously used, most importantly inside the box, all were not properly  arranged, USED HEADPHONE too.Scratches on the phone."
4,"The best Samsung note deal during the amazon prime day sale. Thank you Amazon.I'm not going to write, which is already available from techtubers and other customers pros and cons review out there.In my short term usage, battery is sufficient and it only does get hot at the complete set up, while apps installed in the backend. If you are transferring data from ios to android, it does get heated up. However, after that no heating issues can be found with regular use.Also, no extra pen tips in the Jul'2021 manufacture box. People buying post that might be disappointed for missing extra tips. Amazing stereo sound from phone and if you are looking for quick animations, go to developer mode and reduce all the animation effects to lesser than .5x to nill.OVerall 4.7/5.0."
1,Bad üëé camara performance
1,Phone case is missing in this product.
1,Worst value for money paid for this phone.Severe network problems are there in the phone. In between the calls suddenly network going out  (automatically going in flight mode) and calls getting disconnected.Very poor performance in terms of network signal issues and call connectivity.Camera quality is good. Battery is ok. No option to take any screenshot easily.As a whole this phone is too much overpriced and not recommended at all to buy in this Price.
1,"After 2 days of useBattery life - very badEasiness to use on daily basis - very bad (they need to learn from OPPO or others in the market)Value for money - other than S Pen, phone is normal and trust me S Pen is of no use to pay such high amount..Camera quality - very goodWhen we pick up call wait, there is no sound..In my review better to go for some other phone, this phone should be around Rs.25000.."
4,"Phone, display,  pen, camera is really good 5star. The con is battery is not up to the mark and due to ex990.  The phone gets heated. Rest is all smooth"
3,"Cons:Mobile hetting heatBatter draining fastPhoto quality is poor conpared to my old mobile note8...Upgardrf from note 8 to note 20, but note 8 is much better."
5,I am happy to use this phone and to get a phone like note 20 with this all offers is such a great deal for me It is really great using this phone with knox security its best build in and this phone can perform faster than any other device üòÄ
5,"I was hesitant to buy this and was planning to buy the Ultra, however picked this mainly for flatter screenPeople complain a lot about exenos proc... not sure whats the expectation, but note device is for professionals and executives,  who need a phone to support office workBeing a heavy user of calls, taking notes, presenting and attending calls , the phone does the job very wellBattery lasts full day and charger is good, 1 Hr for full chargeQuad HD or FHD+ you cant tell the difference,  I have an S10+ with QHD screen, believe me I cant tell any diff.Stereo speakers are loud and bassySpen is great and usefulCameras are amazing .... i mean ammmaazingThe only problem....  no case in box, and its difficult to find a slim case anywhereBuy it without hesitation, seller SBML is responsive and ships on time"
4,"I have used this phone for 2 weeks and so far experience has been very good.Pros:1. Good performance and snappy response2. Good display, refresh rate of 90/120 would have been better.3. Can complete one day with office apps, battery is good,4. Inbuilt phone audio call recorder, dual whatsapp, viber and other apps supported natively. Separate work profile supported.5. Spen is good have not used it too much however it gives a premium phone feeling.6. 256 GB storageCons:Finger print sensor  is average and require multiple attempts. Could have been better.Over all good purchase and I feel satisfied."
5,"Purchased for Rs.54,999 with no cost EMI for a tenure of 6 months .For this price Note20 is value for money. Only part which this gadget lags is the 5G connectivity.In terms of performance , no need of further credentials required for Samsung Note"
4,"I like the software Customization the way Samsung did. Stylus has definitely added uniqueness to this phone. But in the mean time Battery is very poor In compare to my previous phone which was oppo reno 10X zoom with Goof battery. Here I am not biased with any specific brand but OPPO gives me satisfaction in sense of battery power. The battery is draining very fast, if we use light mode theme, so I am learning how to manage my Samsung battery full day.  Battery is only thing which disappointed me alot in this phone.Over all feature wise this is gud phone."
5,PROs :Amoled display of60 HZ ( more thanenoughS-Pen at itsbestvery smooth & fast processorNice UIBest evercamera configurarion better thanDSLR256gb ROM is more than sufficientElegant Look &PremiumfeelingStrong default Neoflex TPU Screen Guard already fittedcall Qualitymind blowingCONS:GORILLA GLASS could be 6 OR 74G only no 5GBattery could havebeen 5000 MAH
3,"Performance is good,ui experience is fantastic.Samsung should give glass back at this price point.But biggest problem is heating problem, serious heating problem is present.Another big problem is battery draining, battery is draining too fast. Ultimately not a good option this Note 20. Find other mobile,not deserve 45,000/- rupees."
3,S pen not working properly.  I tried after 10 days of delivery as the delivery place is different from my usual place. I bought note 20 with the intention to make quick note. But very much dejected by as S pen not writing over the full screen. Portion of the screen I could not write. What to do?. I is more than a week after purchase I noticed. I have been using Samsung mollies for the past 15 years but this time very much dejected. Affected customer. I want to bring this to your notice.
5,no complains as such .I wanted this phone for stylus and it does the job .Performance is alright. I had OnePlus 7 earlier and the difference is majorly on battery and chipset side . Note20 Battery gets heated up quite quickly while playing heavy games like Asphlat 9 whereas in OnePlus 7 i didnt faced the battery heating up issue.Also Note20 comes with  Exynos 990 processor which is slightly slower than One plus 7 snapdragon chipset.Overall nice phone as one really dont see that difference in everyday use except while playing heavy games .Stylus faetures are  awesome. If samsung replaces the chipset with latest snapdragon then it's gona boom this phone for sure . GO FOR IT
1,Phone  Is not good phone battery is ok but camera is bad The camera looks like the one from zfold 2 I have zfold 2 but this  similar looking camera is awful no pics are good either in day light or night ‚Ä¶ yes the S pen is ok but overall the price is too high without 4g I tried to replace it another phone they said it‚Äôs no possible .. very disappointing service and the phone and S pen has already too many scratches looks the phone was already used
1,"I bought the device during the Great Indian Sale in October 2021. I've been experiencing massive overheating on the top of the device and screen while using heavy appsWhile using Google maps navigation in the sun, the phone overheats and all apps are automatically shut down. You have to wait for the phone to cool before you can use it again. Absolutely unimaginable for a flagship."
5,"With bank offers, exchange got it for 47k,I guess it a great buy at this priceProsExcellent cameraStylus for ease of notesGreat Samsung UIConsAt times doesn't feel like flagship premium phone, Could have provided curved edges like S20+Battery - drains out by end of the day, need to charge again in the night"
4,"I have owned Note from the beginning of its launch. Note 1, 2 , 4 , 8 and now 20. The phone is excellent value for money. The process is fast and ine dosent feel any slowness at all even while multi tasking. Sleek looks add to the charm. Yes, the plastic nack is a bit of a dampener as I cant use the wireless charger I got for my Note 8. Otherwise, an excellent buy."
5,"Note20 is all about the elegance of the classy looks on the delightful mystic bronze colour. Wedded with the S-Pen, this note from samsung is smart work device at its best.  Battery is good.  Speed is excellent.  Touch feel is extra sensitive.  What more in a smart phone.  Worth the money,  it's quality design."
1,Phone takes  ages to charge and battery drains very quickly  not happy with the  phone
1,"Phone is good but lready used, FB messenger logged in with unknown ID. Top transparent sheet missing on phones screen, Frequently hanging during usage. Phone already updated it's meant used phone. Unable to replace. Unable to register complaint. Please help."
3,Look - Rating 4/5Camera - 3/5Battery - 3.5/5Performance 3.5/5Overall 3.5/5 on Middle range 5G..
5,Really awesome display üòç super camera super design fabulous üòçüíê
1,I wasted my money. Lots of hangings and very slow. Network issues. This is not a 5G or even equal to 1G. Please do not buy this and waste your money. I asked for a refund but Amazon saying is can be replaceable. Not a good service by Amazon and don't know why they are selling such a third class mobile.
4,Mobile is good but net profile working is very slow. I am using airtel 4g sim but not working properly.Camera is not good.
5,Very good display and in hand feel is great. Good camera and it works decent in low light. Great battery life. Overall good phone. I got good first day offer discounts also. Colour os after update is working very smoothly and giving a great user experience.
1,"Recently I ordered it, while recording video from front camera, screen is becoming white and also the video,Also while normal uses, it hanging and screen is becoming black.This experience is necessary for the people who are going to buy new mobile with their hard earned money.Take care."
5,Best mid range 5G smartphone by OPPO.Pros :1. 5G support2. Clean Color OS by OPPO.3. Fast Charging with massive battery.4. Sound quality is decent.5. Light weight & handy phone.Cons :1. Camera needs improvement.2. Feels little bit bulky design.3. OPPO should provide earphones with box.
5,"My usecase - I replaced by secondary phone Redmi Note 4 - wanted to 5G phone with good battery and Sub 15K price tag. Primary use as a GPS navigation in car, Gaming and backup Hotspot phonePros -1) Very lightweight and extremely well built2) ColorOS is flawless - simple, elegant and bug free3) Decently fast phone and responds to quick touches well - especially while using at 90hz4) Able to handle games easily - its a future proof chipset5) Aesthetically, no concerns - decent phone to carry around6) Great connectivity with my various bluetooth enabled devices - My Bose 700 soundbar, Oppo Enco X TWS and even my fitbit smart band.7) Surprisingly good video call quality on selfie camera8) rear Camera setup - since not my primary phone, but if i have to rate it, i will give it 7/10.Cons -1) 18w is a decent charging adapter - but if u r used to faster charging, this will dissapoint you2) screen brightness is good, but being an ips LCD display, it will still keep you wanting more3)Mono Speakers are decent but not loud enough."
2,"I am writing my open review of this phone after using approximately 18daysPhone looks very good look wise 5 out of 5 üåüCamera quiliy is good but not expected from this price pointPhone some times working slow, something I feel I am using my old phone, it means phone performance is not match from my expectations, On this price we should have to buy another phones."
1,"The product which I got, it's not charging even after 4-5 hrs of continuous charging, frequent hanging, and d touch sensor s not dat much great compared to other products, I experience  frequent black outs even, it's disgusting to use this product"
3,"Phone design and look is ok... Camera quality is average (as I bought it for only 14000) it could be a way better.The phone has unique manufacturing defect that it gives error message while using that |the phone temperature is very high"" and automatically phone data and other programme stop working...Even the phone body not heat that much... This is the major issue as you can't use mobile data or camera without restarting the phone or leave for 10minute hold..."
4,Phone was awasome in its price range.there only 2 problems for this phone1 call recording it says when we start call recording. And auto call recording was only for contacts in mobile.2 mobile heat issue while charging.
5,"Very nice phone, I brought it at an offer period, but it cost is little bit more,Battery backup decentCamera clarify very goodPerformance... Very nice...Snapdragon Proceccer is the best compare to mediatek. Budget friendly phone, 128 gb and extra slot for increasing memory, 6 gb ram... Very good... Face recognition system and finger print sensor are awesome....."
1,"Pathetic camera quality, network connectivity and video call picture & voice. Voice is coming broken. I request everyone who is willing to buy this phone, please please don't buy this phone, specially when u r willing to buy from Amazon. They r cheating with customers. On 2nd day i tried to return this mobile but they r not returning it, they want to send technician. What technician can do with the camera quality."
3,Phone is heavy. Annoying app in phone which you cannot remove. No one will write about the bloatware. This is data stealing strategy adopted by big players in market. I wonder after paying 18k for phone still I have to deal with bloatware. It's better to take phone with stock android like Micromax.
1,Never ever buy this phone. This is a failed model. Camera quality and performance is below 1 star. Battery life is half an hour if you are streaming videos and plus it takes more than an hour to charge which is opposite to company's commitment. This is completely waste of money.The below review is for Amazon company.Plus whe I tried to return they asked me arrange for visit at home to check the phone. The technician did not show up however they updated on system that the visit was completed which is wrong.
4,The Product is nice the Only issue is with Charging time. It claims 18W fast charging but taking more than usual to charge. It took around 120 minutes to charge from 41-100%. Either the charger supply is underrated or company is claiming it wrong.
3,"on the time of call recording other person knows the this call is going to record, Screan recording issue."
1,"I am not able to connect my Bluetooth with it, and it has a hanging problem too, I can't send a video call from the phone , I am not able to accept the video call, the calling sound quality is not that great üòí"
2,"It takes 145 minutes to full charge.Facing issues with sim slot1.Camera is normal as other oppo phones.Battery life is good.It could have been cheaper.Front camera is 8 mp ,it could have been better."
5,Best smart phone I have purchased so far in such reasonable price with exchange of my old phone I got Rs 4000 discount. There are lots of advance and useful features in this phone which will give you the feeling like the costly phones. Great feeling in hand like a chocolate bar and you want to bite it. Excellent design.
3,"I am writing this review after three and half month of purchase. I have purchased a few mobiles beforr but never got so much frustrated like this one. As per my opinion, not worth the money, typing is the worst experience for me as well as the sound quality. I do neither play games nor watch movies, so no review for that.If you are a phone addicted person, then you shouldn't go for this one. Touch quality os also very poor in comparison with money. Overall comparing with price my rating is maximum 2.7/5."
2,"Device is little heavy. Camera quality is average and not appear of 48 mega pixel. Camera quality has really disappointed me. Screen is also not soothing for eyes. Overall, it's doesn't satisfy the brand reputation and money spent on it."
5,"This mobile phone is the best phone available under ‚Çπ 20,000 with 5G technology.  Here are some of the features of this phone:Pros -1. Cheapest phone with a 5G snapdragon processor, dedicated memory card slot with two SIMs.2. It's dual 5G phone which means you don't need to change the SIM slot to change the 5G usage between two service providers.3. 6 GB RAM which can be enhanced by 5 GB extra.4. Good battery life. It is running almost 40-45 hours with descent usage which includes WhatsApp, news reading and other daily usage with 4-5 hours of wi-fi support to laptop.5. Supports almost all the features required in a mobile of this category with many shortcuts.Cons -1. Doesn't have IR blaster which is required to use it as a remote control.2. Camera is decent but could have been better.3. Size is little large for men but almost all the phones are coming with this size only and hence, we don't have options.4. Too many pre-installed apps which can't be removed/uninstalled/disabled.There are other phones in the competition but all others lack some or other feature e.g. dedicated memory card slot or snapdragon processor (as mediatek processors are leading in 5G race)."
5,"Being an IT Head I always look for tech specifications of a mobile before purchasing the same.  After a lot of browsing, reading about specifications about the latest mobiles 6GB+128GB, I've selected this product to gift this product to my Daughter on her birthday. A little bit confusion was there about the product. But when my daughter received it, she is very happy about the specification & about the look. The glossy finishing of the back is too pretty. My daughter has installed the 'Genshin Impact' in this mobile, it is running very smooth way. And I've checked all of the functions of the same. Camera resolutions is too good. One of the best product."
1,I got a faulty product so I have raised a complaint to exchange but they don't have this phone in stock
4,"Though it's relatively new. I loke this phone. It's fast, clear cam with many options.Battery backup is good as of now.Being into marketing, my phone usage is very high. Also I watch movies and play games.Still it gives 24 hr backup with everything.As of now, I am liking it."
5,Just loved it ....Cons: 90hz refresh rate is just awesome .Finger print sensors are too good and even face lock.The processor is smooth and the battery is just love easily last for 1.5 days with normal use and a day with heavy use.Cons : I haven't found any cons.
4,"It's a choice able budget 5G smart phone. Very good looks, built quality decent, performance smooth, display and touch excellent, battery acceptable, voice and sound quality very good, no network issue, no heating issues, but cameras not good at all. SAR value is low in this segment 5G(Head: 1.066 & Body:0.607).Though it's the review after 18 hrs of uses. The actual review will be done after 1month of uses."
5,Looking is awesome and stylish look ...I feel it's quite better and budget 5g phone.  Performance also very good..go for it...
5,"Phone is very good. Box comes with phone case(synthetic) also phone has temper glass sticked to it, No heating , Just used it for a day, Good battery backup"
1,Sound quality is not good
5,"6bg with 128gb is sufficient for regular use. 2 days of using with 6-7hr approx talk and mail , WhatsApp network usgae. Battery goodCharging time little longer compared to other models fast charging I m not quite happy as it takes 2 hrs for complete charge.Overall 8/10"
4,"Using 1 weekBettery : as mentioned in descriptionCamera quality : not as much setisfy as other oppo phone, If yor looking for camera Go for otherPicture Quality: with FHD+ picuture GoodGame Performance: If you Looking For Pubg , Not supported XtremeBut you can't depend on Last bettery bellow 20%. It drain too shortly"
5,Camera and battery life is very very good and this phone comes with 90 hz refresh rate and 5G that‚Äôs make this phone very awesome in middle range budget phones.I am a iOS user so I am purchased this phone for my mother and My mom very happy after getting this.Thanks Amazon and Appario üëå
5,"One of the best phone within 16-17k range. Purchased for 15k.Good and fluid performance, good camera, easy to handle, body weight ratio is good. Can easily handle by one hand. Outdoor pics r good, indoor pics r OK. Can easily handle multiple tasks. Battery back up is excellent.In the midrange it's one of the best phones, don't compare with phones above 50k."
1,"I was happy to get the phone at a price 17k. However, the feeling is vanising slowly as the phone screen is glitchy(during audio calls the display vanishes and appear like a CRT TV without cable connection-signal noise on screen). This is my second phone from OPPO and both times made me hate the company more."
3,"Performance wise good but seems I received used/Someone returned phone.Screen guard, and multiple apps telling this is used. FB, YouTube,YouTube Music, music party, Music, Gpay, flipkart, Amazon, Hey fun, hey tap, like gaming related, photos related, space related like clone, Google drive etc and Many apps are available. I would like to return but took it on Emi basis and need phone.Is this issue from Oppo or Amazon? Not satisfied and no feeling that I bought a new phone"
3,Good 5g phone from oppo....Features and everything is fine but only disappointment is the camera as I was expecting a better camera as such price from oppo. But camera is just OK.
1,Received damaged product. really disappointed.
1,Backwash phone no good phone cheap pro. Mediatek 720 screen TFT and battery charger  slow 15 watt only like 10000 phone ..nothing good..samsung very poor phone ..don't buy in 20000 ...TFT like 5000 phone display
5,Good 5G phone
5,"Bought it on the first day of launch. Delivered the next day. Very fast delivery by Amazon. Have been using it for last two days.Pros1. Phone has glass at the back which gives it a premium look. Feels stylish to carry it along.2. As usual, Samsung screen is smooth. Good picture clarity.3. Adaptive brightness 8s one of the best I've come across till date.4. Phone is very light.5. Camera quality is also very good. Front camera is also decent.6. Battery life is more than 24hrs for regular browsing over 24*7 wifi connection.7. Fingerprint sensor on right side is handy.Cons1. Charger is only 15 Watt. 25/30 Watt would have been better.2. Nothing else as of now.I feel good holding and using this Phone. If there is any chance then I'll update the review."
1,"Speakers are very very weak, produce very low sound, you will need headphone or speakers to listen music, I purchased it on first day and now they are just offering replacement which will not solve the purpose as every samsung M32 5G phone has this problem so I would recommend others to not waste their hard earned money in this phone as cost is too high compared to quality"
1,"Phone look is nice,Battery drain 65% after normal use 4 hours and 15 min.Camera is not as 48 mp if I compare my vivo phone 13 Mp is better than thisIf I talk about all over performance so phone is only good looking else nothing is in this device is goodPlz don't waste your money"
1,"I sold the phone sameday somehow on olx in 4k loss. Amazon doesn‚Äôt provide return.Phone is a joke.Plain M32 had full hd screen and now with 5G price has gone up by 6k and display is surprisingly half hd(HD+) . This is plain loot.Plastic is cheap.Camera is worst than any 10k phnSlow processorEven screen lags in scrolling, such bad refresh ratePathetic Processor and ramOverall its from 2012 times where HD+ was a thing. This phone is 9 yrs late.Never buy samsung in this segment."
3,They really need to work like motorola
1,Dislike- camera
4,"Received what I ordered.Received on time which is good, Thanks Amazon Team.Good Quality mobile from Samsung.Cheapest 5g ever with 12 band support.Purchased for my wife she is happy with phone.This worth and value for money üí∞ I would say.Sky Blue üîµ color looks premium!"
1,"After using one month I am writing this review,1. Galaxy M30s is better when compared to M32 5G, M30s has good battery capacity and camera quality,2. The camera quality is poor and the pixels.3. In this phone we can expect only 5G option that too we have to check after upgrading the sim.4. Regarding softwares I will post after updating the new software installation from Samsung,"
2,Over heat is produced while charging and when wattsapp messages receive and downloading. Spoke to customer care executive but they are not ready to take return
5,"Smooth touch, future ready with 5g, sleek design, expandable memory option upto 1 tb.First impression of the phone is good,when used phone continuously for over 2 hrs, videos and downloads and battery went from 50% to 25%, so i expect it to run for a day with full charge. Fast charge is also excellent, but not like other fast charges available in market. Its 1 min for 1% approxThere has been a issue with the M series of phones with UI not responding and system hangs, but this processor on m32 seems to be strong and they have I reckon resolved the issue (recommended not to use Samsung in build apps much as they consume lot of data and there is unnecessary lots of cashed data stored).Camera is OK, but they have lot of features like macro cam for close up night mode and have snap chat filters pre-added on camera which makes it fun and handy.Overall a perfect buy at this price range."
4,"Cons:1. Charger Adapter is only 15W Fast Charging unit. It takes  nearly 2 hours to get fully charged2. Charger wire length is less than 2 feet (comparatively less to the normal length of Charger wire )3. Fully charged phone will stand only 1 day if we use the phone at full level (use internet + calls ) through out the day.Pros:1. We can use secure folder option for securing confidential info/apps and data when we hand over the phone to some body either using finger print or pin or a pattern which is different from phone pattern.2. I got phone with RAM of 6 GB and installed several apps and used , phone doesn't show any slow down in speed.3. Finger print sensor at side switch on/off button seems to be attractive."
1,"Good phone till now except the finger print button location which accidentally pressed always when we are holding the phoneUpdate: reducing a starFacing glitches, not able to hear when I call to some body at first, if I keep try 2nd or 3rd time, then only I can hear.If it connect first then voice is not clear. Never faced any of these in my earlier realme phCharging time taking hell lot of time.Update: pls don't this phone, it's speaker is not clear, when I call its giving some disturbance not able hear the voice clearly"
1,"It's a worst mobile phone ever, Samsung proof that they are loos their credibility in India. This phone can not be worth more than  8k to 10 k. Camera is very poor, You can only use single Sim if you are using Micro SD card, Display is very poor , plz don't buy this phone. I think Samsung is going footprint of NOKIA ."
1,"The quality of camera, screen and performance or not at all good.camera quality is very very poor not even capturing photo like a phone of cost 3k. And the return policy of amazon was worst. Not a proper response by the executives of amazon. They are not accepting the return of this product, don't know the reason behind this. Dont  Why they are enecouranging sale of this product,  when they are getting similar problem form multiple customers.  Belief on amazon have worsening day by day.. literally disopinted with the amazon."
2,I personally  felt  display and front cam  ok ok but atleast rear cam for 23k 48mp its not good quality also. I am preferred to buy Samsung  but not this model
1,Dont buy this it is not worth for money. It is working slow
5,Pros:-1. Display (Best display you can get at this price i.e.  Super Amoled with 90Hz Refresh Rate2. üîã Battery (6000 mAh big battery)3. Camera ( 64 mp) and selfie (20 mp) and if you  know you know samsung image processing  software.4. Looks and back Design ( Awesome Pattern with  rainbow üåà reflection.)5. Compact Size (6.4inches) not too big and not  too small.......handy..Cons:-1. Processor (mediatek helio g80) which is a low  end processor and it might not affect your  overall performance if you are not a heavy  gamer or something like that.2. Infinity U display. Nowadays drop notch display  is kinda outdated look since overall look of the  phone is great but this small thing is like a black  spot on a white chart paper.##But Also keep that in Mind how can you get  everything in just 14999 -17999 ........in mid  range...these specs are perfect and at last you  can trust the brand name too.üòè
4,Cons:1.Good phone at this price.2.Display Quality is really great. Looks premium3.Camera is also very nice in daylight. In indoor it takes some shacky images.4. For Normal use I think it is best phone considering Samsung √Ämoled display and security.CONS:1. Could have been better if it comes with strong processor2. Samsung should have provided a Back case3. This phones support 25w charger but only 15w charger is provided so there must be 25w charger in the box
4,"I am sure there will be many reviewers who will do an in-depth analysis and list out the pros and cons of the device. So here i am pointing out the negatives that i felt . First thing first, the ring volume is mediocre. Ring is not at all loud and i wondee whether I have recieved a faulty device.Second thing i loathe is that, the back cover is a fingerprint magnet. Some kind of resin or composite material is used.To be honest, i didn't like the phone much. The design is outdated and sub par a 10k phone. Since bought this for an elderly person, the ring volume was a total bummer for me. Thats it, another useless review from me."
1,"I purchased this phone on 16999 from Amazon by exchange .but I did not find any quality as per this high price.1. Phone touchscreen is very slow and sometimes hangs stop working.2 while viewing YouTube the voice is not coming clear sometimes voice going up and down ,  microphone and speaker of this phone is not up to the mark even I should say worst. Of its kind.3 this phone is marketed as 6 gb ram but most of the phone memory is already approx 3 gb is occupied by pre-installed app which you can not remove. This is complete cheating with customer regarding storage.4.in whatsapp I am unable to select the more  photos. Its processor is very slow.even slower than  my previous phone .Do not waste the money on the premium phone like these.Better go for any other company"

1,"So greatful to Amazon for sending me such a nice product which has already landed in samsung service centre twice within one month of purchase, it was possible only when amazon refused to take back the product within the return period even though they've so called 'no questions asked' return policy.Above all Samsung did a great jod too by keeping the phone with themselves for 10 days now, sometimes I forget that I just bought a new phone because either it's not with me most of the times or it is sick.Lastly Amazon didn't even bother to reply back to my grievances.Hats off to you guys."
1,Samsung  is forcing the user to install all the junk applications  in our phone.even the Ota update installing the junks.Performce of the phone is pretty decent.Camera is also giving the good shots but the junk app spoiling the party.More than a samsung phone you are purchasing  bundle of junk applications
1,Worst camera. Seems like camera of local phone.  Returning this back.Too heavy. Don‚Äôt know why they are considering that 64 mp. Poor camera quality.

3,"I'm a just a basic user of phones.  No movies, no games.  I mainly use phone, messages, photos, chats and other social apps and some utilities.  For the price, the features seem impressive and for my mild usage this phone sounds great.What I did not like is the amount of apps that were already installed on the phone!  Then I had to un-select a whole bunch of ""recommended"" apps during setup.  I was pre-subscribed to 'diagnostics' and 'recommendation' and 'marketing' notification by default!  Is that allowed?  Some features don't work unless I use specific apps.  Basically, they are app features and not phone features.  Sounds 'grey-area' to me.After spending half a day to go through all the settings and clean up the mess I think I'm ready to use this phone.  I still wonder what else I missed..."
1,Don't buy this mob... Camera performance is worse than 8k mob... Battery backup gives 1days.. On 60ghz..... 15k wasted.. No nfc...  Lost trust on Samsung.
5,My review after a week of usagepros-------*Battery - lasting for 2 days*Display - Great AMOLED display*Separate slot for memory card*Camera is also goodcons-------*Sometime touch is not working.*Battery - taking 3 hours to get fully charged. Nowadays we can get phone charged within 2 hours*Notification light is missing. Every time we need to on the button to check whether we have received any calls or messages*It is said that 15w charger but in adapter it says 10w (5.0 V = 2.0 A)*Too much of unwanted apps are pre-installed*Very outdated processor.
1,I am fully disappointed with this model.perfomance wise not good . Operating app is also slow taking so much time to open and download app .aslo taking so much time to charge after 40 % any mobile take 45 to 60 min to full charge but this mobile take around 90 to 120 min to charge.not worth it .not recommended to any one .
1,Battery Life is very poor .Even though it is 6000 mah battery it doesn't last a full day and needs to be charged atleast twice a dayEven though it is less than one month it's UI constantly stops and have to be closed.The response is extremely poor .I have been using One Plus 5 for the past 2 and half years and its response is better than this new device which is hanging and apps are crashing time and again .I had preferred an Indian phone to Chinese one but have been extremely disappointed with the performance of this phone
2,"I don't suggest to buy this m32 mobile, there is no extra features as they mentioned in their options, there they mentions atmos dolby sound, but third class sound in speakers and that option is not working, secondly palm swipe for screen shot is not working camera is so so, very bad product from samsung, I tried all the ways to take screen shots using palm swipe but I can't, if possible pls replace with another item mr amazon"

5,"Amazing phone. I would rank it the best overall phone experience. The pros are obviously known to everyone, the 90hz display is great. The touch feel is literally like butter. Cameras are great. Amazon prime runs in HD so widewine l1 is there. Speakers are loud, not tinny but lack bass. Can't complain.Phone requires careful first time setup to avoid ads as suggested by ranjit sir. No ads encountered yet. Everything works well, side mounted power button /finger print reader is fast and accurate. Light sensor, proximity sensor are flawless. These 2 are typically bad in Chinese phones (mi note 5 pro user) causing display to turn on when in call, so thumbs up.The cons: the processor seemed weak on paper, but the experience is great. Not that I am defending samsung, but a compromise 90% can blindly make. I do not play games, so can't say much but better processor phones out there. This is for general public who wants smooth experience of samsung phone and no software bugs.Some complained of emmc5 storage, but apps installed damn fast and I did not find and sluggish read write speed issue. Fast and phone did not heat during setup process when installing 100s of apps and no slowness observed. I have 2 m30s in house, they also pointed out better build quality, better looks of my black version and fluidity of screen. Good for light gaming. Go ahead with the phone for good vibes throughout phones life. Now samsung is giving 3 years of software updates, so great."
1,"Display is good and bright. Battery  average. It's not that speed being 6gb ram, while making  call it lags. Camera not upto mark, I miss grand camera which was better  than 64 mp. Over priced, don't have basic features  of other M series phone. On the name of brand Samsung started cheating people.  They should  atleast  provide  cover."
3,"After purchasing Samsung M12, was looking forward to getting M31, but the mobile was not available and the prices increased. After waiting for a month, saw that M32 is available so purchased it but not entirely happy with it. The phone rings on its own at times, chimes continuously other times without any call or notification being given. Phone lags at time and opening apps also takes time. Perhaps the 6gb variant is better but I have 4gb model. OneUI was supposed to be stable and I am quite disappointed with this particular purchase at least."
1,"This is my first review of Any product purchsed online. I'm shopping online since ages now. But this Phone FORCED me to write a review.I've been Using Asus Zenfone phones till date for my usage, Had a wonderful experience....First time ever shifted to Samsung just because of so called Brand Name.WORST DECISION.Camera OK.Battery OK.Performance OK.Screen OK.Brightness OK.Within 1 week Lock switch stopped working.I'm locking and unlocking by screen tap option because samsung people have said it'll take time to repair.Body completely cheap plastic material.Heats up with normal usage.When in pocket automatically wakes up and starts typing numbers or dials emergency number.With No disregard to Samsung I'm saying very bad phone you've made.Very overpriced. Should be of 9k or less.Others opinions may differ from me. This is just my personal experience.I'm sorry to give you less stars Samsung but please improve your quality not quantity. There is no mandate to launch new phone every week."
4,Pros: Screen resolution is good. Speed and performance is ok ok. Sometimes got little sluggy during parallel execution. Camera is very good quality. Battery life is good. SW is really smooth. Speaker is louder enough. Finally it's not a Chinese brand.Cons: No 4k or HDR video viewing. So some videos are blurry even though it is HD. During charging phone gets heated up. Tats may be it has bigger battery. 5G support is not Der since most phones are now with 5G. Price might have been little less to compete Chinese brands.
1,"purchased this phone on 16999 from Amazon by exchange .but I did not find any quality as per this high price.1. Phone touchscreen is very slow and sometimes hangs stop working.2 while viewing YouTube the voice is not coming clear sometimes voice going up and down , microphone and speaker of this phone is not up to the mark even I should say worst. Of its kind.3 this phone is marketed as 6 gb ram but most of the phone memory is already approx 3 gb is occupied by pre-installed app which you can not remove. This is complete cheating with customer regarding storage.4.in whatsapp I am unable to select the more photos. Its processor is very slow.even slower than my previous phone .Do not waste the money on the premium phone like these.Better go for any other company"
5,"Good camera features,Good display quality,Good battery backup,"
1,Camera quality not good and battery backup very bad.üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†
2,"Best camera quality at 15k Not for gamers only for simple multimedia use and want a secure phone. Yes it lags too much on normal and heavy use .No carrier aggregation by samsung prosser support carrier aggregation only 3 thing is good about this phone camera,display and battery"
5,"Using since last three days ...completely satisfied with everything. In this segment so many phones are available but if i get the SAMSUNG then why i should go anywhere else...Pros:Display - SAMOLED with Full HD, Side Curves make you feel so happy. Brightness is awesome.Sound - Dolby Sound is also good specially with wired headphone.Battery - Without internet 2 days do not worry to charge it and with internet one full day.Call Quality : Also goodVideo Calling - BestCamera : Picture is so goodProcessor - Fast as it comes with 90Hz refresh rate.Cons:Notification LED Indicator is missing but can be managed.RAM could be 8 GB but if you choose the quality then it can be also ignored. 6GB also working fine.Verdict: If you are not a GAMER then blindly you can grab it."
5,"Value for money and best is 90hz super amoled display and 64mp quad camera. Best for listening music and watching videos as it has 6000mah battery goes 1+1/2 day ""but this phone is not for gaming"""
4,"best Non-Chinese smartphone preference under 15K | Excellent battery | Decent Camera | Smooth | Stylish look | Mummy Loved it ( I gifted it to her)Not made for chhapri youth icons of India.Not the best camera phone under 15K.for gaming under 15k > Motorola G40 / POCO is better option.if you are a decent user, who loves to watch videos/ browse social apps then definitely go for this.for Mumma/PAPA this would be best choice rather than Chinese smartphones.(Thumbs UP) BATTERY : Screen On Time > More than 13H for Mumma. she watches Jio Tv & browse social apps quite often.(Processor) MTK G80 doesn't lag much as compare to Exynos processors + it is better optimized for battery consumption. example Samsung M21 2021 with same 6k mAh battery with Exynos processor gives 7-9h Screen on time only, while Samsung m32 with same 6K mAh battery with MTK Processor gives more than 10-12H screen on time."
2,Waste of money. Don't but this phone. I'll not recommend it to anyone. Today I received  this and within 24 hours am reviewing  the product.  It's not worth . Camera is bad. MI is much much much better. I shud have listed to other reviews  before buying this.
2,"Seeing few YouTube videos,I purchase it,  It's 7-Days now.Processor is G80 , Which Don't support 90Hz& Don't support 2k Videos & Pics.,But, People who use for minimum usage like 2-3hr YouTube,  Amazon videos good.Most time it's 60hz , so, u feels Videos üìπlag ,When u take FHD pic it takes 2-4sec to save it.I am feeling M40 which I got 3-years back is much faster..So, Always go with Snapdragon processor.."
5,"The youtuber reviews will tell you that this phone doesn't have a powerful processor that others will offer you at this price range. It is a fantastic mobile for an average user like me. You should have to look what your purpose of the mobile you want purchase. If you want to play games like pubg and you want professional video/photoshoot this phone is not definitely not for you. It is good to watch youtube videos at high quality with samsung's amazing samoled screen, it can take some good photos and videos and can do some games even pubg at minimal settings.I thing like this people who drive  vehicle at a speed of 60 k.m per hour wants a car that have very powerful engine and they will never need that much power. Like that I don't need a very high performing processor and other features that I may not use.So think, if you are a person who only wants to use mobile for to make and take call and watch videos and occasionally wants to play some game, then this mobile is definitely for you.My job is some what risky and I need automatic call recorder to deal with my risky customers. This mobile has that feature. Its my purpose and that's why I bought this phone.Its a good phone an average customer."
5,"In love with this beast in reasonable price, camera quality is really great, screen resolution is far far clear and colour full, battery is strong, light weight, compact size, all required smart phone features are build in the phone. Good job Samsung team."
1,Do not buy. There are plenty of other good options for the price. Main issue is the PROCESSOR.  I just felt it's too slow compared to  the mobiles available.  Phone is also bit thick . And I think its manufacturing is stoped too.  It's only sold online. If I had a chance I would buy a different phone .
4,"Don't waste money on redmi or realme jst in sake for money. This phone is very nice for decent users. It is an all-rounder in all tasks, but for decemt usage. Camera is very nice than redmi, realme, oppo etc. Notch is very small and does not disturb. One UI 3.1 has tons of features to customize. My rating 8.5/10.All the Best!"
5,Great product. Bought it for display and battery.Cons...Processor is not powerful enough to draw 90hz. Battery is also drained so fast while use 90hz refresh rate.So I switched back to 60Hz. Performance improved and battery lasts longer than before.
5,Nice product value of money.i have used 30days nice proformnce
4,Over all look very good comfortable. Nice.  Battery is simply good. Satisfactory product. Camera  quality in not good

1,"P35 chipset At this cost , waste of money , don't go for this phone , dont waste your hard earn money"
5,Phone is very fast you get 5gb Ram instead of 4gb and Camera is very very good. Must buy for camera lover
3,The phone lags. Decent battery. The screen freezes at times. Camera is fine. Charging is also good. Overall not worth.
5,I have been using this phone for last 15 days. No issues have been seen. It looks premium phone and does not look like 13k phone.
3,"Processing slow when working online , battery backup good, look beautiful, fingerprint working perfectly. All over performance quite good. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
3,FUNTOUCH OS ...IS VERY BED AND POOR ...DEAR FRIENDS DON'T BUY FUN TOUCH OS  BASED  MOBILE  OTHERWISE MONEY IS TOTALLY WEST.
1,Dont buy this it is not worth for money. It is working slow
5,Pros:-1. Display (Best display you can get at this price i.e.  Super Amoled with 90Hz Refresh Rate2. üîã Battery (6000 mAh big battery)3. Camera ( 64 mp) and selfie (20 mp) and if you  know you know samsung image processing  software.4. Looks and back Design ( Awesome Pattern with  rainbow üåà reflection.)5. Compact Size (6.4inches) not too big and not  too small.......handy..Cons:-1. Processor (mediatek helio g80) which is a low  end processor and it might not affect your  overall performance if you are not a heavy  gamer or something like that.2. Infinity U display. Nowadays drop notch display  is kinda outdated look since overall look of the  phone is great but this small thing is like a black  spot on a white chart paper.##But Also keep that in Mind how can you get  everything in just 14999 -17999 ........in mid  range...these specs are perfect and at last you  can trust the brand name too.üòè
4,Cons:1.Good phone at this price.2.Display Quality is really great. Looks premium3.Camera is also very nice in daylight. In indoor it takes some shacky images.4. For Normal use I think it is best phone considering Samsung √Ämoled display and security.CONS:1. Could have been better if it comes with strong processor2. Samsung should have provided a Back case3. This phones support 25w charger but only 15w charger is provided so there must be 25w charger in the box
4,"I am sure there will be many reviewers who will do an in-depth analysis and list out the pros and cons of the device. So here i am pointing out the negatives that i felt . First thing first, the ring volume is mediocre. Ring is not at all loud and i wondee whether I have recieved a faulty device.Second thing i loathe is that, the back cover is a fingerprint magnet. Some kind of resin or composite material is used.To be honest, i didn't like the phone much. The design is outdated and sub par a 10k phone. Since bought this for an elderly person, the ring volume was a total bummer for me. Thats it, another useless review from me."

4,Pros: Screen resolution is good. Speed and performance is ok ok. Sometimes got little sluggy during parallel execution. Camera is very good quality. Battery life is good. SW is really smooth. Speaker is louder enough. Finally it's not a Chinese brand.Cons: No 4k or HDR video viewing. So some videos are blurry even though it is HD. During charging phone gets heated up. Tats may be it has bigger battery. 5G support is not Der since most phones are now with 5G. Price might have been little less to compete Chinese brands.
1,"purchased this phone on 16999 from Amazon by exchange .but I did not find any quality as per this high price.1. Phone touchscreen is very slow and sometimes hangs stop working.2 while viewing YouTube the voice is not coming clear sometimes voice going up and down , microphone and speaker of this phone is not up to the mark even I should say worst. Of its kind.3 this phone is marketed as 6 gb ram but most of the phone memory is already approx 3 gb is occupied by pre-installed app which you can not remove. This is complete cheating with customer regarding storage.4.in whatsapp I am unable to select the more photos. Its processor is very slow.even slower than my previous phone .Do not waste the money on the premium phone like these.Better go for any other company"
5,"Good camera features,Good display quality,Good battery backup,"
1,Camera quality not good and battery backup very bad.üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†
2,"Best camera quality at 15k Not for gamers only for simple multimedia use and want a secure phone. Yes it lags too much on normal and heavy use .No carrier aggregation by samsung prosser support carrier aggregation only 3 thing is good about this phone camera,display and battery"
5,"Using since last three days ...completely satisfied with everything. In this segment so many phones are available but if i get the SAMSUNG then why i should go anywhere else...Pros:Display - SAMOLED with Full HD, Side Curves make you feel so happy. Brightness is awesome.Sound - Dolby Sound is also good specially with wired headphone.Battery - Without internet 2 days do not worry to charge it and with internet one full day.Call Quality : Also goodVideo Calling - BestCamera : Picture is so goodProcessor - Fast as it comes with 90Hz refresh rate.Cons:Notification LED Indicator is missing but can be managed.RAM could be 8 GB but if you choose the quality then it can be also ignored. 6GB also working fine.Verdict: If you are not a GAMER then blindly you can grab it."
5,"Value for money and best is 90hz super amoled display and 64mp quad camera. Best for listening music and watching videos as it has 6000mah battery goes 1+1/2 day ""but this phone is not for gaming"""
4,"best Non-Chinese smartphone preference under 15K | Excellent battery | Decent Camera | Smooth | Stylish look | Mummy Loved it ( I gifted it to her)Not made for chhapri youth icons of India.Not the best camera phone under 15K.for gaming under 15k > Motorola G40 / POCO is better option.if you are a decent user, who loves to watch videos/ browse social apps then definitely go for this.for Mumma/PAPA this would be best choice rather than Chinese smartphones.(Thumbs UP) BATTERY : Screen On Time > More than 13H for Mumma. she watches Jio Tv & browse social apps quite often.(Processor) MTK G80 doesn't lag much as compare to Exynos processors + it is better optimized for battery consumption. example Samsung M21 2021 with same 6k mAh battery with Exynos processor gives 7-9h Screen on time only, while Samsung m32 with same 6K mAh battery with MTK Processor gives more than 10-12H screen on time."
2,Waste of money. Don't but this phone. I'll not recommend it to anyone. Today I received  this and within 24 hours am reviewing  the product.  It's not worth . Camera is bad. MI is much much much better. I shud have listed to other reviews  before buying this.
2,"Seeing few YouTube videos,I purchase it,  It's 7-Days now.Processor is G80 , Which Don't support 90Hz& Don't support 2k Videos & Pics.,But, People who use for minimum usage like 2-3hr YouTube,  Amazon videos good.Most time it's 60hz , so, u feels Videos üìπlag ,When u take FHD pic it takes 2-4sec to save it.I am feeling M40 which I got 3-years back is much faster..So, Always go with Snapdragon processor.."
5,"The youtuber reviews will tell you that this phone doesn't have a powerful processor that others will offer you at this price range. It is a fantastic mobile for an average user like me. You should have to look what your purpose of the mobile you want purchase. If you want to play games like pubg and you want professional video/photoshoot this phone is not definitely not for you. It is good to watch youtube videos at high quality with samsung's amazing samoled screen, it can take some good photos and videos and can do some games even pubg at minimal settings.I thing like this people who drive  vehicle at a speed of 60 k.m per hour wants a car that have very powerful engine and they will never need that much power. Like that I don't need a very high performing processor and other features that I may not use.So think, if you are a person who only wants to use mobile for to make and take call and watch videos and occasionally wants to play some game, then this mobile is definitely for you.My job is some what risky and I need automatic call recorder to deal with my risky customers. This mobile has that feature. Its my purpose and that's why I bought this phone.Its a good phone an average customer."
5,"In love with this beast in reasonable price, camera quality is really great, screen resolution is far far clear and colour full, battery is strong, light weight, compact size, all required smart phone features are build in the phone. Good job Samsung team."
1,Do not buy. There are plenty of other good options for the price. Main issue is the PROCESSOR.  I just felt it's too slow compared to  the mobiles available.  Phone is also bit thick . And I think its manufacturing is stoped too.  It's only sold online. If I had a chance I would buy a different phone .
4,"Don't waste money on redmi or realme jst in sake for money. This phone is very nice for decent users. It is an all-rounder in all tasks, but for decemt usage. Camera is very nice than redmi, realme, oppo etc. Notch is very small and does not disturb. One UI 3.1 has tons of features to customize. My rating 8.5/10.All the Best!"
5,Great product. Bought it for display and battery.Cons...Processor is not powerful enough to draw 90hz. Battery is also drained so fast while use 90hz refresh rate.So I switched back to 60Hz. Performance improved and battery lasts longer than before.
5,Charger and speaker ü§∑
5,Good
5,Good..but no music player!!! Lots of app.
5,"Audio comes with single üîä , volume is good..Back üì∑ is too good picture quality and its AI technology as well.Camara features slow moshion video recording, potrate short are good..Font üì∑ need to improve more images are over shared , but value for üí∏Performance.

But I noticed a little battery heat on contenuse watch of YouTube for 4 hrs. Which is normal..Ram and storage is also good for this price in market.. hope this techno Spark.. will be really a spark riser in mobile industry..Hoping the best , value for money product in coming future.. all the best.. thanksIt's my honest review.. hope his will help for others.."

1,Bakwas Q ke sound problamAal sound very low. Not extra speker only one speaker incoming and out goingBakwas third class mobilePlese this mobile not purchesses
4,"Hopefully, a fair review after 24 hours of usage.Pros:1. Camera (both front and back) - A very decent one even on low lights.2. Huge battery backup - It can really withheld for 3 days for day to day usage.3. Performance - Fair one TBH. Obviously G35 at this price range is upto industry standards.4. Android 11 out of box. Hope Tecno keeps the device updated for next two years.5. Display - Bright and crisp (though 269ppi). But upto standards and smooth touch sensitive.6. Flash lights - Perfect and bright 4 LEDs at back and two in front. Front LED is also bright enough. One of it lights up during charge inlet with dimmed brightness.7. A plastic back case and screen protector film (already applied).Cons:1. Missing Type-C. It is micro USB.2. Battery - Charging duration takes ages. 3+ Hours!!3. Finger print scanner - one of worst at this price range. You had to adjust the finger to find right spot.4. Bloatware - Huge list of uninstalable list of apps.5. Front LEDs - No option to be used for notification alerts.To conclude, good one at this price range. But honestly, it could have been a 500 bucks more lesser considering branding which is striving to come up. One can easily go for top brands in market for the same configuration with and additional 500 bucks. Hopefully, Tecno doesn't let their customer down like the way other few brands did."
1,Very poor quality phone don't buy this phone phone is very slow and hanging problem heating problem also
1,sound and camera quality not goodPicture Quality badCamera performance averageSound Quality very very poorTotally disappointed....

3,"There is some lag while opening apps, speaker quality is not good, otherwise everything is good at this price (got at ‚Çπ7999)"
5,"Its a value for money phone. You can't expect smooth performance from a low budget phone like this. But this is a very good mobile for daily uses.With heavy uses it gives 2days battery life.Both the cameras are on par. Nothing great, nor bad.Lots of bloatware on the UI.Loudspeaker volume is little low, but sound while calling is very clear and high.Overall it's a good phone for the people who have tight budget or doesn't need super camera/gaming experience."
4,Speaker quality is not upto the mark
1,Worst sound quality 1st day hang finger print not work properly totally unsatificed with this mobile. I was asking about return this prodcut but amazon is refuse this i lost 9000 rs. I am never ever buy from amazon. Totally dissapointed

5,"Techno 7T------------Nice phoneDisplay is goodCamera is goodSpeaker is okay okayCall quality is goodFast processor and you can play games alsoOverall good experience and I think it's better than the most phones.Don't buy high end phones, it's a trap. It's a depreciating asset. It's going to die in one or max two years.Instead, buy a good home product for your wife mother or sister and live in a good environment.Jai HindHave a great day!"
4,"*PROS -1.Battery backup is amazing.2.Rear camera quality is awesome, Front camera quality is good.3.phone design is unique & attractive.*CONS -1.Support only 10W charging.2.Only one Speaker for both calling & Music.3.Fingerprint sensor very bad,It doesn't work properly, it works 4/10 times.I give 0 rating for fingerprint sensorSo,i said to tecno to fix this problem.,Otherwise phone is awesome."
5,"Camera - Nice camera quality as it has one AI Camera so it makes picture so much brighter.Battery - Battery is awesome, very good battery backup. Even after 2 hour continuous gaming, battery gives great backup.Processor - No lag at all if you are doing gaming or anything, it's performance is awesome.Best phone by tecno in this price. You should go for it ...."
3,Good phone in this price segment.Pros-1. Better battery performance2. 48mp camera3. Unique designCons-1. Major cons _ fingerprint is not good.It works worse.i have never seen this type of fingerprint in smartphones in last 5 years.2. Micro usb cable3. Speaker quality4. Location of power button.
3,Poor Product only thing that I liked is camera which is good at this price range... but other than that it hangs a lot...and heats up as well.. no recommended..this is my 1st and last tecno Product..bye bye tecno..
5,"I bought this phone without knowing much about the company. It was just a gamble which paid off. I got it at Rs 7740, and comparing it's specifications with its price, I feel it is a steal deal.Pros at this price:6 gb RAM and 6 gb storage_5 starsCamera AI and 48 MP _5 starsFinger touch sensor_4starsFace unlock sensor_ 5 starsBattery life _ 4 starsTouch and feel _5 starsSoftware is similar to OPPo but response is better.Cons: a bit heavy ( may be due to huge battery)Overall a good purchase."
3,"Review after 40days of use , The net speed is mostly bytes /sec. not connecting to online classes at this speed. I haven't seen in bytes /sec.  in my other mobiles. To attend online classes mobile data is not going to be used as the speed is b/ s.  The mobile has good features 4gb RAM 64gbROM, 48MP rear camera  + AI camera, front camera 8MP, 6000mah battery @ Rs 8000 is  good but netspeed in this phone disappointed alot.  If you watch movies or attend online meetings then don't ................................ don't ................ ."
3,Good camera . Double flashing on front screen.Baterry life ok.Big screen.I bought it for 8599/-In this price everything is well good except the speaker üîä.They could have given a dedicated speaker for music and videos.
2,"Average quality. But I bought this phone with 48mp camera's expectations. I'm disappointed. My vivo phone's 13 mp camera quality is far far better than this. Finger print is always a problem. Sometimes touch screen also not working properly. Even though it has a 4gb ram and 64 memory I additionally added a 64 gb samsung memory card,, All after this phone is hanging and lagging..even contacts is opening slow. I don't have any big games on my phone though. Inbuilt palm store ads are coming daily to install some apps. Everything inside is Google's including Dialer. It has call recording option but you cannot record a call without other parties knowledge. When we press record or put it in auto record it says NOW THE CALL IS BEING RECORDED loudly. Which can be heard from both sides speakers. We are using record option for our safety purpose. If someone is harassing or bullying or even blackmailing how will we handle that. It is not women friendly mobile.. I suggest women not to buy this phone."
4,Battery: 5/5Performance: 4/5Camera: 3/5Speaker: 3/5Display : 4/5Don't get trapped for 48 mp.. it's very average .. except camera  rest all satisfactory
5,"Techno Spark 7TCondition 1- Battery status shows chargingIf we switch off the  power of adaptorCondition 2- if phone connected to charging ,if we toggle the power of adaptor (if power is on then switch of and on again)it shows symbol of charging butDoes not charge.Condition 3- it has no loudspeaker other than earpeace ,sound is not loud and clear when we play videoSo please return ,bcoz 7t me model ka software problem haiNo replacement no refund option given please dont buy at all"
3,I am happy to by this phone .. It's better than 5000-6000 MI brand phone ..1..Wifi catching system low .. other phone catching 2 bar but this phone catching null ..2 .. Network capping quality very poor ..3 .. Speaker very very low quality .. One head side speaker it's pathetic .. & Sound I am don't explain ..4 .. Fingerprint point sensor not good .. more than one tach then unlock..
2,"I am having problem with the speaker and mic. When we speak we get to hear our own echo. Other person cannot hear you and you cannot hear the other side. It's absolutely useless as phone. It is good as camera, games and extra things. Service is not available. The number they provide for service says he has closed down the shop. The other service centre is a repair shop who is working for the company as freelance. You have to give the phone to them if they can repair they will do it or else send it HO for spare parts which can take 10 to 15 days minimum ( that's the warranty coverage). If you have patience and a spare phone buy it on your own risk.New review as of today 19/9/21The other side cannot hear me.Very bad till today no body responds.Very very very bad"
1,It's have two main bug that you can't avoid1. Volume is too low . You can't listen music  after 3 to 6 months of purchase without earphone2. While charging ; charger heat too much.Otherwise it's good...But please buy until you ok with it.
4,"I gifted this to my mother, it's good and easy to use, camera quality is not upto mark anyone can recollect its digitally managed. Android version is good easy to implement could say better than other cheap devices from Chinese market."
4,"I bought this phone to gift it to my wife. She was always complaining on how her staff used to taunt her for old phone.Thanks Ganpati Bappa, I found tecno spark 7T phone which comes in unfer 11k price range but it is on Android 11.0What you may dislike is1. Two OS; one is Android 11 and other is HiOS7. Why to have two?2. Yellowish tint in camera picture3. Only two camera are givenWhat I like-1. Price range2. 48 MP camera3. Lightweight4. Android 11 OS with lots of features5. Dual front flash6. 6000 mhA battery life"
4,"I've been using this phone for 4days now.I will share my review with pros and cons:cons:1.It feel like a cheap phone idk why,there are some phones in this price segment ""looks"" premium.2.No LED notification,a major missing.3.Rear Camera is not that good in default,but when we changed to 48MP it looks ""kinda"" good.It seems like good in this price segment.4.Its little bit getting Hot while charging and I feel some Hottnes while taking photos(maybe coz of outside temperature)5.It takes quite a bit to get fully charged,yah the battery is 6000 but its fast charging with 18W.6.so much pre installed apps(we can uninstall it) and also like previously,we have to go through each app to disable ""Recommendations""Pros:1.Very light weight and it doesn't feel a massive 6000 is inside2.Front camera is Superb! good detailed pics in portrait.3.Battery is so good.I use the phone to take a lot of pictures and use it for 1 hr swiping through Instagram,the battery doesn't notice that at all lol(its pretty good)4.Stereo speaker does that job GOOD5.For games,ya with a medium settings it is good for 1hr continuous gaming after that it gets little hot but there is no overheating like that issue till now.This is all I can remember,I will try to update if I notice it afterwards."
1,"Very Disappointed by the product. Camera quality is too bad. The only one thing is in phone is it has 6000mah Battery. Overall this product is very worst. Don't buy if you are looking it as a primary phone which has best camera, Storage & massive battery."
3,"Redmi 9 Power Electric Green (4+128)(FIRST 24-HOURS REVIEW)‚Ä¢ A phone with Superb Design and unique colours‚Ä¢ I have purchased electric green colour and believe it is really superB in looks‚Ä¢ Heavy in weight but its okey as it looks fine in hands‚Ä¢ Dual stereo speakers with ultimate sound quality!! BUT BUT BUT !!‚Ä¢ Redmi claimed 6000mAh Battery, means we think that it will go through atlest ""1 & Half day to 2 days"" of battery backup in one charge, But there is nothing like that.‚Ä¢ The Battery will Last go to 1 day of maximum backup only if limited use.(I charged the phone full in last evening by 7pm and its 1 pm today righ now and it is 55% left with no use as i am using it as a secondary phone, means the Remaining 55% battery will last longer to 11pm. The total battery backup without use of phone will go to 28 Hours, as i am using it as a secondary phone with no whatsapp, youtube or any kind of internet surfing with this phone)‚Ä¢ It means if u want to use it as a primary phone with whatsapp, youtube, and other internet features then i dont think so that it can give 1 day backup‚Ä¢ Redmi claimed 22W Fast Charger with it, apart from it while using its own 22W fast charger it takes more then enough time to charge(It takes time to Charge full)‚Ä¢ Camera quality is like hell, specially the front camera, Don't buy if u wants a Camera Quality in Mid Range phoneSummary:-Purchase it if u want as a secondary phonePurchase it if u want super outer looks with ultimate colour optionsPurchase it if u dont want good selfie camera quality (According to price range)Purchase it if u want a Good Looking Attractive Phone"
1,"Honest review after a week of usage -Do not make the mistake of buying this mobile. While the price point is competitive, it would make lot of sense to pay an extra 1000 and go for the Redmi Note 9 instead of Redmi 9 Power.This mobile has pathetic camera quality. It says 48 MP camera, but the quality is as good as 8 or 13 MP camera. Redmi note 9 having the same camera gives far better quality images. I am truly disappointed with the camera quality.So do not go on the Megapixels. This mobile honestly has very bad camera quality.The performance is OK. A snapdragon octacore processor does not do any justice as I have experienced good amount of lags while opening basic apps.The battery back up is good, but apart from that, there is nothing special about this phone.I regret buying this in the flash sale."
1,"Camera is very worst, In indoor lighting pictures are getting blurred, Front camera is something like 4 years back quality because it has only 8MP.When coming to back camera even with 48MP, photos are not clear.My suggestion is not to purchase this mobile, if you can bare 1000/- more, best choice is Redmi note9 or you can purchase realme phones with in this budget.I tried to return the product due to camera quality not expected, but return will not take return back due to quality issue for mobile phone.I purchased many Mobiles, but this is my first worst experience.So please don't by this mobile üôèüôèüôèüôè"
1,Front camera is very poor for video calling. Sometime screen goes totally white on video calling like hanging problems.Its looking dark face.Also battery is not according to expectation as 6000mAH. Battery showing 20% and suddenly goes 80%without charging.
1,"I bought Redmi 9 power blue (128 GB) in the first sale on 22nd Dec 2020.Amazon delivered it very speedy on 23rd Dec 2020.Reviews:1) Camera: Average for both front and back cameras.2) Sound: Good3) Battery: Drained very fastly, even charging is a bit slower, not looks like 6000 mah.4) Processor: slow processing and sometimes hang also. And touch is also responding slow.5) Games: I didn't try much yet.6) Weight: BulkyI bought it because of the camera but a little bit disappointed with it."

3,"I bought this mobile on the first sale 22 Dec 128 gb version, coming to the phone the miui is the same we find in other mi devices which is the reason I bought the phone but one this which I miss the most in MIUI 12 is the absence of second space(why Mi ‚ùì)Pros: Good battery, 48MP back camera and MIUi 12cons: front camera(my redmi note 5 does a better job), no second space, a bit bulky when you hold the phone"

5,Chief and best
5,Nice phone
1,Front camera 3rd class.
1,"The camera of this phone is not up to the mark, I had real me c1 which costed around 6k has better camera than this phone, also it hangs a lot just in use of 2 days it started hanging and battery backup is not what they claim, I charged Realme c1 my old phone and this phone 100% but this phone drained battery in just 6 hours it came to 23% while realme c1 was at 41%. For sure returning this back and will order some other phone."
1,"Please don't buy this go for redmi note 9 pro.Camera is very bad .I seriously suggest not to manufacture redmi products in India ,all the made in India of redmi is worst ..."
5,"Value For money, Sound quality is Superb, display clarity nice, overall worth for it."
3,Just got the phone in hand and the phone started lagging the next day.1- Performance average.2- Camera Average.3- Bit heavy and bulky too u can feel that.4- Design poor or should i say worse.5- MIUI is worst.
2,It's a MARKETING TRAP...IT CLAIMS to have all the best feature but they performance is below average... it's has all the features but no quality....Only Pros1.Good quality FHD screen2.Battery backup is okay.3. Speaker quality.Cons1. Below Avg camera.2. It HANGS3. NOT A SMOOTH TOUCH.4. TOUCH LAGS need to tap button multiple times one gets irritate.5 . One feels cheated because we have better option in the same price range.Worst use experience. I feel my older 3 GB ram redmi 8a is more smooth than this.My recommendation always give priority to a better Processor.
1,Worst Phone I have seen specs amd buyed it but not satisfied I have samsung m21 mobile which has amoled screen and always on display same they mentioned in this Redmi Note 10s but display clarity is worst than LCD and always on display stays only for 10 sec  .Worst Camera Performnace wise ok Didnt liked this phone and dont trap for technical gimmiks.
3,"All is well but photo quality is very bad. Note 7,9 series is better than note 10s. It's camera need to work on it. It is not capture the details of the photo like previous model of redmi. 48mp camera of Redmi note 9 is very very good than 64mp camera of Redmi note 10s"
4,Good

Par uss pagli ko ye nai pata ki main sach mein dene wala nai hu.Phone toh mere biwi se bhi halka hai.Baaki camera thoda aur acha hona chaiye tha, wo kya hai na mera ek kaala dost hai uske photo ke liye sarre filter laga ke dekhe, par wo bechara abhi bhi kaala aata hai.Baaki sab mast hai."
1,"I ordered this phone, Redmi note 10s has network signal problem. the voice will break always. I contacted the customer support, i had bought this using 10% off. they are not replacing the phone and asking me to order the phone which is at higher price now. they are saying you can give the review whereever you want. they dont even care about the customer. dont order this product. its waste of money"
1,Don't buy. First ever Redmi product and it's disappointing. Screen doesn't light up when someone calls. (Check attached picture).Fingerprint scanner takes ages and many attempts to respond.Front camera is one of the worst that I have seen in recent times.I don't understand how come such a big company can release a product without proper R&D.
1,Camera quality is very Poor and Display it was saying that Super AMOLED display but it was not worth for it

1,No any front light (indicator) for charging miss call or massage battery life not good medium use one day life back side is  vary slippy display is ok ok
1,"I purchased this mobile on 24th April with in 2 days i returned this mobile because i had a issue with hearing the opposite person voice. and received a replacement 11th June on that phone i had camera issue.When i open the camera it will automatically get closed and came to back to home screen hence i again returned. Now they said they will refund the amount. This is totally un acceptable.Never expected such a poor service from Amazon and never expected these issues in Redmi mobiles really very much disappointed.Friends, please don't go for this model its my humble request, Thanks"
1,I bought this phone there is a major problem in network issue I have already returne one phone they give me another one but like same I recommend it to everyone do not buy this  model üëç
3,Google Play store not working. Took one whole day for all the apps and info to be downloaded and finally had to do it through GET APPS option of MI phone. Had to transfer data thru MI MOVER.FABULOUS camera.
2,This phone doesn't have automatic call Recorder and when I Record call manually its loudly announce  your call has been recording  I tried many applications for recording but I'm unable to record call without announcements  so if anybody want to Record calls  so please don't buy thi mobileAnd also I purchased this mobile with no cost EMI but they are charged me 17%interest  its bad experience with Amazon
1,Having problem with speakers in new redmi 10S phone which I purchased...  basic functionality calls not working properly at all - voice is not at all clear in between cut cut.... infact If we spend 1000 rupees & go for basic mobile  incoming & outgoing calls facility works awesome. But Redmi10S worst. Also the Redmi service center response is pathetic they are not approachable & do not accept the issue what we are facing even if we are coming up with proof. they say we have formatted software & no issue is found also they no replacement  & more over they don't even give any statement in writing verbally say no issue. We do get proof any proof for visiting Redmi service center. worst experience I faced spending 15K & buying Redmi 10S mobile. I suggest not to go for Redmi Mobile as I could see during my visit to service center many people visiting center with newly purchased mobile having one or the other issue... I will never ever suggest anybody to go for Redmi.
1,"Please try not to buy this model because I used all the models from Redmi. This is not at all working good.The first mobile after returning(due to Network and High Temperature issue) I got another 10S but this one too is a faulty one. apps hanging, camera not good , battery draining off quickly in stand by mode. I purchased this one by reading positive reviews but u will feel regret after buying this one. don't waste money try different model. always love amazon delivery speed and packing was not good for this product. Seller was also responsive. but fate mobile is a failure model."
1,"Very owful experience first time with Amazon , Bought this for some one's gift but , Camera performance very poor in front camera and rear camera . It's latest vision and quality of Camera very poor don't know it's defective phone received or not !! and replacement is always not available and technician also not available I m very very desapointed with the service and product"
1,"Dear Sir / Madam,I am writing to you to raise an issue about: Mobile Phone and accessoriesThe issue that I have experienced was: I have booked a new mobile ( Redmi Note 10 S ) dated 9th-June-2021 from Amazon and received its delivery on dated 11th-June-2021, When i start using it, I faced a voice disturbance issue initially, I cross-checked my mobile network sim car by placing it in my old phone but there is no connectivity or network issue in my sim cardThen  I tried to reach Xiaomi via their website to customer care & emailed my issue but still, there is no such positive response from their side and still, I am facing such issue"
5,Experience is going through. Almost good üòä
1,"Very bad camera quality,Front camera-in night front camera is like vga camera,no details in picture.Back camera-in daylight if capture a photo no details is seen,if u zoom the image every part of the pic is blurrVideo camera -my previous realme u1 was far ahed of this that was only 13 mp camera.Front camera-1/5Back camera-1/5Video -1/5Processor is also bad pubg in smooth and ultra settings the phn is heating too tooo tooo much."
1,After 10 days of use i am sharing experience. Incoming Audio is not clearPhotos are not natural at allFinger touch westAutorotate sensor not at allworking. You need to do manually.West product. This should less than 7k
1,"I can't imagine that this is Redmi phone, I am using Redmi brand from last 6 years and this is my third mobile set of Redmi.I am not satisfied and even suggest to others, don't buy any redmi more then 10k and above, its not working well in most of the parameters, so only purchase les. Then 10k price Redmi mobile, don't go much higher.I am totally dissatisfied with my latest Redmi note 10 S, if MI company give me chance I will pay and purchase Redmi 10 pro...I would not prefer 10S.So be care....."
5,"The phone is overall very impressive. After my first few days of basic usage, I can that it is smooth and fast with no lag. The camera is impressive in this price range. The UI is also nice and easy to use. Battery is good but not amazing. The sleek and lightweight build adds on to the value. On the whole I would say Redmi Note 10S is worth the penny.Review is based on first week of usage only."
1,I got the phone delivered from amazon and charged it. Within 15 mins it overheated like an portable iron box. Then I requested for a refund but Amazon scheduled a technician visit then I got a replacement. It had the same issue. Now they issued a refund. The build quality of the phone is bad which is causing battery issues. I won‚Äôt recommend anyone buying this device.
1,Poor camera quality. Don't buy this product.I have used real me xt before and it's camera quality was awesome. But redmi has a very bad camera quality comparing to real me... Not worth of money.
1,"I have compared the phone with a much lesser price Redmi note 10, In almost all factors the RMN10 is better. Am not a gaming person. Even using the camera the phone was heating. Am disappointed in buying this device. One of the worst phones I have bought from Redmi.  I have buying Redmi phones since 2015, till now I have bought 8 Redmi phones. This is the only phone was disappointed.Selfie camera in low light is pathetic.64 MB camera performers are inconsistent. Some pics are good"
1,"Not everyone purchase this phone for installing custom OS.. You need to change, you need to improve your OS..."
4,"Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more"
5,"I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera."

1,"The headphone jack is not working  üò° Despite the customer care approved the replacement the delivery boy is not listening to them.He is standing at the door, calling this or that official and not replacing my phone. I feel so much harassed. Please somebody intervene."

1,"Before buying you must know the difference between 7k mobile and 10k to 15K Mobiles .Reason for choosing this title earlier i used a pro version model , Now i am reviewing this model after 3 days of usage.1. Ear speaker quality in outdoor's very poor  . Keep your headphones handy ,2.Sensor's are not working properly ( this is the reason i choose this title , sensor quality is based on price )3.App search option is not available  , you must be very patient to search required app when you have an urgent need , you have to swipe all your mobile to choose required app . or change the launcher . default launcher is not capable of doing this basic function .Rest all other functions are good  ."
1,"This is my 4th MI Phone in 3 years. Earlier ones were good.But here The extra battery has made phone heavier and hence has lost it charm, now looks like chinese phone. Earlier ones were as good as other phone apart from brand.Not recommended.Would love to return but it was gift for family,"
5,"I bought this for an older relative who needed a basic smartphone. Given its pricepoint I didn't have much expectations for the Redmi 8A but after unboxing and setting it up I have to admit - it looks and behaves like a premium phone!In almost every aspect 8A has been upgraded over the 7A. While it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, the camera is much better than I expected. There is a bit of lag in opening and switching between multiple applications but it shouldn't be a big deal for people with basic usage patterns. To facilitate better grip, 8A has a non-glassy back that is textured. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the phone given its pricepoint. For its target demographic (light users who might just want to take some pics, use social media and the occasional app) this is a great phone.The only drawback I felt is that Xiaomi has been aggressive in bundling custom apps in the phone that deliver lots of ads and sponsored videos by default (and it requires some know-how to disable them)."
1,The phone hangs a lot. Processor is too slow. Apps close on their own. Can't ecen listen yo music continuously.
3,Mobile is good at this priceBut when I was using hotspot and screen recording the mobile became overheated it hanged so i switch off it.In this range mobile is really good..
1,Mobile software crupted within 2 months ...I visited MI store after Lockdown ....Mi Store not giving warranty service asking for money for service ...I am longtime user of MI mobiles but this time it hurted me ...no more MI mobiles
1,"We are highly unsatisfied with the product .There is performance issue with the phone in which the touch ,speed as well as the processor is very slow.It does not worth the money and the sound quality is also low.The battery also gets drained very early though it is of 5000 mAH.We have mailed a return request but they have not taken any action.I need to return this phone and want a new phone as soon as possible."
1,Defective display (minor scratch) on the scratch and there is now way i can return / service / request replacement.
3,"Perfect mobile for a beginner level smartphone with 2day battery backup, the only problem is processer only otherwise there's no issues"
1,I purchased this phone in Feb. 2020  from Amazon site and now it's May 2020 and  I find it difficult to swipe it open after the display goes on sleep mode.  So this is the status it's touch mechanism within 3 months.  So one has to be careful about buying cheap quality Redmi phones as the touch mechanism may not be of good quality..
5,"Camera: Good Quality. In good light, the pictures are awesome.Battery: No doubt, awesome backup.Display: Smooth and colors look better than similar range phones.Screen: No tempered is compulsory. Smooth and reliable.Sound: GoodI bought this for mom. Definitely a awesome product for regular average use.Don't see what is missing because what is provided in this phone is rare or not there in other products with same or even higher price range"

I totally disappointed..After that I returned this item then I received new mobile when I opened I directly put into charge, I get the same issue I don't what a do.. what they are doing I don't know they not checks properly and not inspected.. I really upset this service.."
1,Service is good but........
4,"I bought this phone for my dad.Pros:good battery lifelarge screenlook and feel is nicecamera is good for its priceCons:THIS HANDSET IS MADE IN CHINAI thought it is Redmi (made in India), but it is made by Xiomi.Does not have fingerprint scanner."
3,Cons: No fingerprint sensor.No Widevine L1 support.Not a good camera at all. Photos captured are blurry and unclear. Totally disappointed with the camera.Too many MI built in apps which reduces the usable memory in hand.Pros: Premium quality design.Feels good in hand.Corning Gorilla Glass 5.Type C port.Fast charging.Dedicated Memory Card slot expandable upto 512 GB.Super Class Audio Speakers. Sound is very good. Listening music is very much enjoyable.Not heating up while charging.Display not bad at all.All in all a good phone at this price range.
3,"Cons:1. Very bad camera. Selfie camera is not even enough for video calling.2. Performance is not up to mark with 3gb RAM.3. Heating problem with extensive usage of internet or gaming.4. Many unnecessary apps which cannot be removed are impacting performance.Pros:1. Very good battery life.2. Nice display and well built.3. Budget phone.Overall, it is a budget smartphone with less smartness. Lot of notifications which are unable to remove with many unnecessary apps in OS."
1,"Not a good product. Took it to service center. First they changed software. But again started to hang. Requested for replacement, but not getting replacement during warranty. I purchased this because of its high rating and it looks amazon rating is fake."
4,Missing fingerprint sensor but nice phone with nice design
5,Thanks Amazon for delivering the product as mentioned in the product description. It was well packed and delivered.
4,"The phone comes with a 6.22-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720x1520 pixels and an aspect ratio of 19:9. The Redmi 8A Dual runs Android 9.0 and is powered by a 5000mAh battery.The phone is a bit heavier though compare to the other ones. And sometimes it gets over heated.Overall, it's an affordable phone with a very reasonable amount of money."
4,"First  of  all I would like to say,""IT IS THE BEST PHONE UNDER ‚Çπ10,000""....*GOOD Selfie and Rear cameras at this price.*FAST CHARGING*GOOD PERFORMANCE*STYLISH EXTERNAL DESIGNS*BEST SPEAKERS*BEST FOR PLAYING GAMES LIKE FREEFIRE ,PUBG etc...(but You should play with Standard Graphics otherwise occurs a heating issue )*NO FINGERPRINT FACILITY*NO EARPHONES AVAILABLE WITH THE PHONE*PREVENT THE DEVICE FROM RUNNING IN LOW SPACE other wise There will be a Lag iSsue.."
5,"Brilliant camera, huge battery life and brilliant display in addition with the premium feeling of SAMSUNG. It's a shame that this phone's launch was delayed due to lockdown.Highly Recommended phone üòäüòä"
5,As a title it is obviously a monsterAnd very very good performance
3,"I am writing my review after using it for 6 days.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range."
1,"Very poor performance. Hangs aloft. Even I don't use any gaming app. In browsing only, this phone lacks. Inspite of having 6 GB RAM. This product serves zero rating. Please don't buy  this. Wastage of money. No refund policy for this device."
5,"Its a one season wonder. All was good till the one year mark.I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great for one year. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I was more than satisfied TILL ONE YEAR.After the one year and two month mark the phone started to automatically restart and freeze every 5 minutes of usage. Went to Samsung care and they said the motherboard has issues and need to be replaced and asked me to pay Rs 8000 since the warranty period was over. To my surprise the issue was not only with my phone. Many M21 buyers had the same issue, although some were lucky enough to have replaced the motherboard in warranty period.So my point is this phone is not a Rs 14499 phone instead it is a Rs 14499 + Rs 8000 phone if you want it to use it more than 1 year. In brief it is a Rs 22499 phone. You can get better phones in this price range.AVOID AT ALL COST"
2,Even realme performs better.....few issues which concerned me after use were1. When recording slow motion videos...there is  always flicker on screen.2. fingerprint sensor needs more than few attempts to work3. Camera is better than realme but not as good as redmi4. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming5. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone6. Mobile data connection vanishes many times in a day...I thought it was my airtel network .....but the same sim works on my old volte phone...without any issue....Suggestions for people who have bought this phone.....Since company does not provides a screen guard..... Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early...Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone.....If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....I am attaching two videos one in normal mode.....second in slow mode.....both videos are made by m21......you can see the flikr effect in second video easily..
5,Very Nice Mobile good all
1,Heating problem. In simple browising only phone gets heated up in upper side. When asking for replacement amazon customer care they are fooling us. Very pathetic condition.
1,"The phone(M21 Raven Black) is not working properly since its purchase. After the first installation, it is on frequently on and off mode and even restarts after more than 30 minutes. Moreover 4-5 times it takes more than 2 hours for starting.I also register a complaint to Amazon regarding this. I don't need such a disgusting phone any more. it wastes my 3 days. So, I request to Amazon kindly refund my money, I don't need replacement."
5,Just one word AMAZING
1,Now Amazone has REPLACED THE DAMAGED ONE NOW THE PHONE IS GOOD ENOUGH...PREVIOUS ONE WAS Nonsence What A Nonsence Battery It Comes to 90% Charge After a full charge only if u do something in10 minutes.... What nonsence is this. NEED REPLACEMENT. Do you people think customers are Mad.
1,"After 5 hrs continuously  charging level reach 55 %,during call sound quality not clear,a lot of heating problem,camera quality not good,network issue,slow processing..poor performance"

1,Otg pendrive not supported
1,"This phone's video,photo quality and audio quality is very poor"
5,"I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.üòÄ"
1,"Samsung m21 Mobile not in the delivery box, only charger and pin are available. Need refund for the same.For mobiles, its better to opt for cash on delivery, to avoid getting cheated."
4,"Looks like just to clear the unsold stock of m30s they gave it a new name and advertised it as a totally new phone. Everything is similar to m30s, except the price (and selfie camera). Good thing is that they kept the price low.Just got it delivered today. So far so good, many users compalined about battery, charging speed, display issues on m30s. Hope they got it resolved in m21."
1,Samsung Co. Claims that Samsung M21 has fast charging facility and It has 6000 mAh battery but these two claims are totally bogus because I've purchased Samsung M21 and received my order yesterday after using this phone I plugged in charger for charging it took approximate 9 hours to charge the Mobile phone and after full charging approximate 2 hours the Mobile phone battery get reduced 50%. I'm totally disappointed with this phone.
4,A nice looking phone.Light weight because of the plastic body. Performance is pretty good.But it doesn't feel like a 6000 mAh battery. Probably a little shy of that figure. It Drains relatively quickly than what is expected of a 6000 mAh capacity.But overall a product worth it's price. Probably not good for high performance gaming.But expect it to be durable with a low-medium usage.
1,"Don't like this product. It looks, it's already used by someone else. Apps are not downloading. It shows 6 appsare downloading. I'm confused."
3,"It charges very slowly, though they claim that it has fast charging?Has anyone else also facing this issue?"
1,Amazon delivered a defective phone to me and then they don't even receive my call while I tried to approach them.  Buying Samsung Galaxy M21 is waste of money.
1,1. I bought this to gift it to my dear one but I am shocked to see the camera quality of this phone is like 1 mb. I tried all the modes but it enhances the photo brightness automatically and and the photo becomes like a cartoon.2. Tried installing other camera apps but still the quality is poor.3. Tried options for returning but found that there is no option for that.4. Spoke to customer care and they say that they can only replace if the product is damaged and no option for quality related issues. I said that I am ready to buy any other product too. But no response from them.It‚Äôs better to buy from local store than going behind Amazon.
5,Value for money
1,What can I say just after 30 min.of recieving this phone I applied for return my money. Before this phone I already have 2 phone of Samsung's working good but this phone made in India is hot like a oven.I can't take it near my ears .I have to use ear phone.I call customer care they give me different different idea but problem remain same.I don't give advice to buy this product to any one be careful.
3,"I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21.The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED displayThe issues I faced are1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP).4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging.Among all these issues I believe it is an average deal under 13k"
4,"I like the camera quality, screen sensitivity,  and browsing experience. The speed is excellent.I don't like it's sound. The speaker is not the best, sometimes when I put on loud speaker the person I am speaking to will complain they cannot hear me. Plus when I play music the sound is not the best. Also, the phone does not come with original earphones so you have to hustle for that. Lastly it will take 3 hours to charge and still the battery will only last for 24hours."
5,"Display good, battery  performance  after one  week  of use has improved,camera is good,hope Samsung  provides  regular  updates..Excellent  phone  keep good  work  up Samsung üëå"
1,Battery  drain quickly... and phone heat a lot.
1,recently i ordered samsung M21 6GB RAM 128GB Flash.Unboxed and started the phone. it surprised to see so much of heated while booting itself.I tried to inform to Amazon . they tested with some remote diagnostics application surprisingly it showed the temperature is degree.I am using Samsung phones long time. this time my experience with M21 is very very badNew buyers please little careful about heating issue
1,Giving only one star because it compulsory. Sensor not working and heating fast
5,"Realy very very good phone,but stil I did not get,due to covid"
1,Received Samsung M 21 yesterday..highly disappointed  about slow charging and poor quality of camera..did not expect this from Samsung.I suggest not to buy this mobile.
5,I got this phone 11249. Best Display best Battery Good camera and Samsung BrandingSo people must buy this phone this price.Other phone can't beat
4,"Amazing phone But m not satisfied with camera quality, its 48MP? I used samsung galaxy S8 its only 12MP single camera which is good for m21 tripple camera.One more thing is back panel is plastic which is not good looking inthis range ..Its not feel premium with this budget...."
2,"I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s.M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacksM21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50sBattery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick.Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage.Pros:Super amoled screen6000 MaH batteryCons:Signal strength is very poor.(You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app)Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc"
1,"78k for a plastic back,does samsung think people are that stupid.samsung is seriously out of its mind for pricing this phone so high."
1,78k for plastic back + outdated exynos + 60 hz 1080p display + no 5gExynos 990 also has heating issues.It should be priced around 50k.
5,"Well its a good note phone for a start, cracked a lucrative deal though, exchanged by 1plus6, suffices all needs for a techie user."
1,"OLD MOBILE GIVEN WITH  FAULTY , PLEASE RETURN IT AND REFUND MY MONEY, I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH  AMAZONE SERVICE, NOW IT WILL EFECT TO AMAZONE REPUTATION , PARTNET GIVING OLD GOODS, PLEASE CARE AND TAKE"
5,"Owning a Note Series has always been an exciting feeling. And the discounted price is a cherry on the cake!So I bought this for the S Pen and the beautiful display. People who complain about plastic back at this hefty price, don't know what it feels to have a glass back break into a million pieces. If you have a butter fingers, plastic saves! And most importantly everything at this price ends up in a good Spigen case anyway.Also not having a 120 Hz or 90 Hz display doesn't bother me. Days are already busy wfh and I hardly notice the difference. Also 5G, we don't have that kinda tech here in India. So no point buying the Ultra either.Display and Camera are good, that's Samsung USP.Getting a decent battery life considering I have been playing alot many games and using the S Pen a lot.All in all a very happy Samsung Boy!Peace! ‚úå"
1,Worst battery life. Doesn't last half day.Received fake product with tampered box no user manual and no ejection pin.Pathetic customer service. Not ready to refund money or help in anyway
1,I bought samsung note 20 for my brother as a diwali gift which got delivered yesterday. And today by a mere fall the s pen broke into pieces. Now i know why many reviewers wrote about the plastic body.
4,"Excellent screen & speed, enjoying the experience. Felt slight heating issue and average camera result in zoom mode. Normal mode camera performance is awesome."
5,"The product is definitely good. The delivery through Amazon was fast and as desired. However, the packaging could have been a bit better from Amazon side.Only regret I have is that Samsung came out with a discount offer immediately after the launch. I feel its unfair for the loyal customers. The discount should have been announced either at least after 3-4 months or the benefit should have been passed on to prebooking customers as well."
1,"Seller has cheated;Used phone has been delivered, clear sign of previous use, Missing accessories - Like, Extra tip for stylus & it‚Äôs clip for replacement.Headphone has been also previously used, most importantly inside the box, all were not properly  arranged, USED HEADPHONE too.Scratches on the phone."
4,"The best Samsung note deal during the amazon prime day sale. Thank you Amazon.I'm not going to write, which is already available from techtubers and other customers pros and cons review out there.In my short term usage, battery is sufficient and it only does get hot at the complete set up, while apps installed in the backend. If you are transferring data from ios to android, it does get heated up. However, after that no heating issues can be found with regular use.Also, no extra pen tips in the Jul'2021 manufacture box. People buying post that might be disappointed for missing extra tips. Amazing stereo sound from phone and if you are looking for quick animations, go to developer mode and reduce all the animation effects to lesser than .5x to nill.OVerall 4.7/5.0."
1,Bad üëé camara performance
1,Phone case is missing in this product.
1,Worst value for money paid for this phone.Severe network problems are there in the phone. In between the calls suddenly network going out  (automatically going in flight mode) and calls getting disconnected.Very poor performance in terms of network signal issues and call connectivity.Camera quality is good. Battery is ok. No option to take any screenshot easily.As a whole this phone is too much overpriced and not recommended at all to buy in this Price.
1,"After 2 days of useBattery life - very badEasiness to use on daily basis - very bad (they need to learn from OPPO or others in the market)Value for money - other than S Pen, phone is normal and trust me S Pen is of no use to pay such high amount..Camera quality - very goodWhen we pick up call wait, there is no sound..In my review better to go for some other phone, this phone should be around Rs.25000.."
4,"Phone, display,  pen, camera is really good 5star. The con is battery is not up to the mark and due to ex990.  The phone gets heated. Rest is all smooth"
3,"Cons:Mobile hetting heatBatter draining fastPhoto quality is poor conpared to my old mobile note8...Upgardrf from note 8 to note 20, but note 8 is much better."
5,I am happy to use this phone and to get a phone like note 20 with this all offers is such a great deal for me It is really great using this phone with knox security its best build in and this phone can perform faster than any other device üòÄ
5,"I was hesitant to buy this and was planning to buy the Ultra, however picked this mainly for flatter screenPeople complain a lot about exenos proc... not sure whats the expectation, but note device is for professionals and executives,  who need a phone to support office workBeing a heavy user of calls, taking notes, presenting and attending calls , the phone does the job very wellBattery lasts full day and charger is good, 1 Hr for full chargeQuad HD or FHD+ you cant tell the difference,  I have an S10+ with QHD screen, believe me I cant tell any diff.Stereo speakers are loud and bassySpen is great and usefulCameras are amazing .... i mean ammmaazingThe only problem....  no case in box, and its difficult to find a slim case anywhereBuy it without hesitation, seller SBML is responsive and ships on time"
4,"I have used this phone for 2 weeks and so far experience has been very good.Pros:1. Good performance and snappy response2. Good display, refresh rate of 90/120 would have been better.3. Can complete one day with office apps, battery is good,4. Inbuilt phone audio call recorder, dual whatsapp, viber and other apps supported natively. Separate work profile supported.5. Spen is good have not used it too much however it gives a premium phone feeling.6. 256 GB storageCons:Finger print sensor  is average and require multiple attempts. Could have been better.Over all good purchase and I feel satisfied."
5,"Purchased for Rs.54,999 with no cost EMI for a tenure of 6 months .For this price Note20 is value for money. Only part which this gadget lags is the 5G connectivity.In terms of performance , no need of further credentials required for Samsung Note"
4,"I like the software Customization the way Samsung did. Stylus has definitely added uniqueness to this phone. But in the mean time Battery is very poor In compare to my previous phone which was oppo reno 10X zoom with Goof battery. Here I am not biased with any specific brand but OPPO gives me satisfaction in sense of battery power. The battery is draining very fast, if we use light mode theme, so I am learning how to manage my Samsung battery full day.  Battery is only thing which disappointed me alot in this phone.Over all feature wise this is gud phone."

3,"Performance is good,ui experience is fantastic.Samsung should give glass back at this price point.But biggest problem is heating problem, serious heating problem is present.Another big problem is battery draining, battery is draining too fast. Ultimately not a good option this Note 20. Find other mobile,not deserve 45,000/- rupees."
3,S pen not working properly.  I tried after 10 days of delivery as the delivery place is different from my usual place. I bought note 20 with the intention to make quick note. But very much dejected by as S pen not writing over the full screen. Portion of the screen I could not write. What to do?. I is more than a week after purchase I noticed. I have been using Samsung mollies for the past 15 years but this time very much dejected. Affected customer. I want to bring this to your notice.
5,no complains as such .I wanted this phone for stylus and it does the job .Performance is alright. I had OnePlus 7 earlier and the difference is majorly on battery and chipset side . Note20 Battery gets heated up quite quickly while playing heavy games like Asphlat 9 whereas in OnePlus 7 i didnt faced the battery heating up issue.Also Note20 comes with  Exynos 990 processor which is slightly slower than One plus 7 snapdragon chipset.Overall nice phone as one really dont see that difference in everyday use except while playing heavy games .Stylus faetures are  awesome. If samsung replaces the chipset with latest snapdragon then it's gona boom this phone for sure . GO FOR IT
1,Phone  Is not good phone battery is ok but camera is bad The camera looks like the one from zfold 2 I have zfold 2 but this  similar looking camera is awful no pics are good either in day light or night ‚Ä¶ yes the S pen is ok but overall the price is too high without 4g I tried to replace it another phone they said it‚Äôs no possible .. very disappointing service and the phone and S pen has already too many scratches looks the phone was already used
1,"I bought the device during the Great Indian Sale in October 2021. I've been experiencing massive overheating on the top of the device and screen while using heavy appsWhile using Google maps navigation in the sun, the phone overheats and all apps are automatically shut down. You have to wait for the phone to cool before you can use it again. Absolutely unimaginable for a flagship."
5,"With bank offers, exchange got it for 47k,I guess it a great buy at this priceProsExcellent cameraStylus for ease of notesGreat Samsung UIConsAt times doesn't feel like flagship premium phone, Could have provided curved edges like S20+Battery - drains out by end of the day, need to charge again in the night"
4,"I have owned Note from the beginning of its launch. Note 1, 2 , 4 , 8 and now 20. The phone is excellent value for money. The process is fast and ine dosent feel any slowness at all even while multi tasking. Sleek looks add to the charm. Yes, the plastic nack is a bit of a dampener as I cant use the wireless charger I got for my Note 8. Otherwise, an excellent buy."
5,"Note20 is all about the elegance of the classy looks on the delightful mystic bronze colour. Wedded with the S-Pen, this note from samsung is smart work device at its best.  Battery is good.  Speed is excellent.  Touch feel is extra sensitive.  What more in a smart phone.  Worth the money,  it's quality design."
1,Phone takes  ages to charge and battery drains very quickly  not happy with the  phone
1,Sound problem and display problem and also on off button not working
4,"Cons:In camera quality, it is below average.The speaker is just average , I will not say that it is bad.Pros:But battery is just amazing and the screen to body ratio is also well maintained and clarity with quality is also good.U can also set pin to lock the phone just like smart phones.And one of its good feature is its torch light it is cool.The radio FM is also good coz u need not to connect a head phone jack.Bluetooth is also good."

1,"Open cheating by Realme.C11(2021) is rebranded as Narzo 50i.Every thing is same except back cover design.We can see model name as 'C11 2021' in 'about phone' setting of Narzo 50i.Worst part is we can get 'C11 2021' at Rs.900/- less than 'Narzo 50i'.Didn't expect this from Realme.Specifications on Amazon show it is a usb c-type cable, but cable is micro-usb."
1,I really disappointed with this product
1,not a good phone. Poor performance . Even it says Realme C11 at some place. Seems faulty phone
4,"I think I am the first buyer and this is first review of this product. üòÑI got it for 6299 Rs in big billion sale.For the price, it's display is bright and good quality. It has type C port which is exciting.(i found out later that it's not type c) 5000 mah battery. 18 W charging. Processor is good for mid graphics games like hill climb racing and few shooting games. It can play pubg but you won't enjoy it much. It can handle day to day apps like Whatsapp, facebook, instagram, chrome, youtube without any lag or heating. Camera is average but for this price it's good. Clickable pictures.It has realme ui which is features loaded. Best UI. I have 3 realme phones and updates are never delayed. Hence company really backup product after sales.Don't expect performance of a 10k or 15k phone. Compare it with realme C11 or redmi9a.Product description mentioned type C charger. That's really misleading. Really bad Marketing.1 star deducted.And yes Mint green is best color. ‚úåÔ∏è"
5,My phone not real which my order is realme narzo 50I but I check in this phone setting about phone realme c11
3,"Even in Settings ---> About phone ---> Device name,  it was mentioned as ""realme c11 2021"" . Ughhh... Atleast you guys should have changed that...."
1,"This was cheated by realme. its not norzao 50i, it is resale of Realme c11. May be they forgot to change the nameüòÄ. I never expected this kind of UI and OS from realme mobiles. Setting options and display and app management is worst. With this phone you can't call any customer care bcuz u can't select the given IVR options."
3,Totally disappointed with Realme.Micro usb charging.Overall phone is okkBut either you can buy realme C11 2021 in less price
1,Video Player is loading.
1,has basic camera.. no use at all.has 5000 mAh battery and no fast charging . so u will have to keep it charged. so its more like basic power bank which will take more time to charge.charging port micro USB not even type Ctouch is very bad. phone in pocket sensors does work. will have to disable it. So completely useless.speaker is mono but quality is below average or very bad.even calling page will take time to go from 1 page to another.Add some money to ur budget and go for better phone. This is worth less phone.expect looks nothing is good in this phone.My suggestion:: do not go for this phone
5,Value for money but fingers print sensor is missing in this model. No back cover in the box as mentioned in spec's.
1,By look phone is nice. Back cover is not provided as mentioned. Camera quality is very low. Most importantly as phone name is showing realme C11 instead of narzo 50i. Amazon or seller should spet up and clear the things as it is confusing the customers. I don't know this phone is real Or someone cheat me.
2,AGAIN NO CASE IN REPLACED PHONE AS ADVERTISED IN THE AMAZON SITE. PLEASE CLARIFY WHEN DO WE GET THE CASE. ALSO THE PHONE MAY BE DEFECTIVE BECAUSE THE SIM TRAY IS NOT OPENING. WHY SO CARELESS WHEN SENDING PHONES TO THE CUSTOMER THAT AFTER FIRST COMPLAINT / REPLACEMENT. GET BACK TO US IMMEDIATELY WITH CLARIFICATION OR SUGGEST ALTERNATIVE.
5,All over good to use but they says the box include cover type c cable but this phone box coming with micro usb and don't have a cover and back plastic body poor i think..
1,"Waste of money  , wifi not working properly..my other 2 phones showing full signal strength but this phone showing only 1 signal strength and not able use wifi properly. Getting disconnectedNo option to return!! Utterly disappointed."
1,Such a trash from Realme.....üëéüëéüëéOn every aspect it is a trap....Dont go for this fone
1,"Wrost mobile, Better guys you buy redmi 9, better than this realme"
1,No C type connector as mentioned in description. Poor quality Camera. Screen guard and Back Cover missing from what's mentioned
4,"When we see the system name it will shown as realmec11 2021,but when we updated the software the name and function must changed into narzo 50i,no one notice that. This is a good budget phone and i am purchased at a rate of 6700 from amazon. Delivery is too fast and  5star rating for Amazon delivery partner."
5,Realme narzo 50iVery nice phoneBattery performance isGood
2,There is no back cover and screen protector as mention in detail.+The Phone is just rebranding of C11 at higher price+It doesn't have type C cable+My Exchange mode is rejected by courier
3,Heating problems are there in the mobile. 3.5 rating.
1,"Display scratches on my mobile, am not satisfied in this product, very worst product"
1,Very bad choice very slow. os bhe slow hai type c port  brake type B prt deya hai fm bhe nahe hai I m a big fan of realme but is mobile ne to realme pe se vishwas he khatam kar deya don't buyAmezon delivery boy alos very rude
5,Best
4,Video Player is loading.
4,"Cons are no fingerprint sensor, apart from that this phone is good, has a 4gb ram and an 64gb storage. Works smoothly."
1,"Mobile Phone is getting overheated while the net is on, battery backup is also very poor"
1,I wanted to replace from the very first day of receiving the mobile due to minor display flickering problem but Amazon didn't give replacement option at all till the last date of replacement .I am forced to use as it is now.Very much disappointed ....!
1,no finger print sencer this rangeCamera quality low average
1,Total product is waste. Please don't buy this

3,Phone lags quite a lotBattery is very niceCamera not goodLooks fabulous from behind.
1,Don't buy this phone. It gets hang after one week of use. Also battery getting heating very much. After one week you cannot replace this phone. Buy some other trusted brand phone.
1,THIS MOBILE IS NOT SUPPORTING 4G SIM
5,Very Good Product
5,Veryyyyy Veryyyy Goooooood Keypad Mobile.I have bought this phone for calling and this is really good looking keypad phone
1,Dont buy this it is not worth for money. It is working slow
5,Pros:-1. Display (Best display you can get at this price i.e.  Super Amoled with 90Hz Refresh Rate2. üîã Battery (6000 mAh big battery)3. Camera ( 64 mp) and selfie (20 mp) and if you  know you know samsung image processing  software.4. Looks and back Design ( Awesome Pattern with  rainbow üåà reflection.)5. Compact Size (6.4inches) not too big and not  too small.......handy..Cons:-1. Processor (mediatek helio g80) which is a low  end processor and it might not affect your  overall performance if you are not a heavy  gamer or something like that.2. Infinity U display. Nowadays drop notch display  is kinda outdated look since overall look of the  phone is great but this small thing is like a black  spot on a white chart paper.##But Also keep that in Mind how can you get  everything in just 14999 -17999 ........in mid  range...these specs are perfect and at last you  can trust the brand name too.üòè
4,Cons:1.Good phone at this price.2.Display Quality is really great. Looks premium3.Camera is also very nice in daylight. In indoor it takes some shacky images.4. For Normal use I think it is best phone considering Samsung √Ämoled display and security.CONS:1. Could have been better if it comes with strong processor2. Samsung should have provided a Back case3. This phones support 25w charger but only 15w charger is provided so there must be 25w charger in the box
4,"I am sure there will be many reviewers who will do an in-depth analysis and list out the pros and cons of the device. So here i am pointing out the negatives that i felt . First thing first, the ring volume is mediocre. Ring is not at all loud and i wondee whether I have recieved a faulty device.Second thing i loathe is that, the back cover is a fingerprint magnet. Some kind of resin or composite material is used.To be honest, i didn't like the phone much. The design is outdated and sub par a 10k phone. Since bought this for an elderly person, the ring volume was a total bummer for me. Thats it, another useless review from me."
1,"I purchased this phone on 16999 from Amazon by exchange .but I did not find any quality as per this high price.1. Phone touchscreen is very slow and sometimes hangs stop working.2 while viewing YouTube the voice is not coming clear sometimes voice going up and down ,  microphone and speaker of this phone is not up to the mark even I should say worst. Of its kind.3 this phone is marketed as 6 gb ram but most of the phone memory is already approx 3 gb is occupied by pre-installed app which you can not remove. This is complete cheating with customer regarding storage.4.in whatsapp I am unable to select the more  photos. Its processor is very slow.even slower than  my previous phone .Do not waste the money on the premium phone like these.Better go for any other company"
1,"This phone is not different then other Samsung phone.  Yeh log but be cheater hai , kuch bhi change nhi . 31 ka 32 fir krenge 33 . Battery utni bilkul nhi jitna Shor mcha rhe hai. Service ek dam ghatiya. Pause Jeb me darkness ke baad uchi deewaar par Chad jaate hai. Please don't  buy Samsung Mobiles more. Ab ye vo people wali companies nhi rhi."
1,"Big major charging issue, charging icon is seen during charging but charging is not increased, that's a very bad or not exceptable by samsungConclusion- company target is money making not making a quality device üò°Now my money is loss and we are crying üò≠üíîüò¢"
1,"Believe me, it's the slowest mobile I saw. Don't go on screen and Battery, it is an extremely slow mobile phone and takes ages to open and navigate. Forget about heavy use, it can't handle normal regular use. I made a huge mistake but pls don't buy this mobile. It's only a few months and I am thinking to change it. Its dam SLOW SLOW SLOW."
1,"So greatful to Amazon for sending me such a nice product which has already landed in samsung service centre twice within one month of purchase, it was possible only when amazon refused to take back the product within the return period even though they've so called 'no questions asked' return policy.Above all Samsung did a great jod too by keeping the phone with themselves for 10 days now, sometimes I forget that I just bought a new phone because either it's not with me most of the times or it is sick.Lastly Amazon didn't even bother to reply back to my grievances.Hats off to you guys."
1,Samsung  is forcing the user to install all the junk applications  in our phone.even the Ota update installing the junks.Performce of the phone is pretty decent.Camera is also giving the good shots but the junk app spoiling the party.More than a samsung phone you are purchasing  bundle of junk applications
1,Worst camera. Seems like camera of local phone.  Returning this back.Too heavy. Don‚Äôt know why they are considering that 64 mp. Poor camera quality.
1,1. Heavy heat on both the sides. Front and back also.2. Charging is very slow.
1,Terrible phone. Always hang and unusable. Returning the product. Don't but this
5,"Processer is good.Both side Camera performance is good.Camera functions is work properly.In Screen look use face sacaner than fingerprint.Provide pre-installed apps Samsung system,  Microsoft system, Google system and Netflix's ,Amazon, etc.Charging capacity is too low, take 1¬Ω hr to charge.Fingerprint sacaner too small, many times its doesn't match.Lots of app pre-installed.25GB memory used out of 128."
3,"I'm a just a basic user of phones.  No movies, no games.  I mainly use phone, messages, photos, chats and other social apps and some utilities.  For the price, the features seem impressive and for my mild usage this phone sounds great.What I did not like is the amount of apps that were already installed on the phone!  Then I had to un-select a whole bunch of ""recommended"" apps during setup.  I was pre-subscribed to 'diagnostics' and 'recommendation' and 'marketing' notification by default!  Is that allowed?  Some features don't work unless I use specific apps.  Basically, they are app features and not phone features.  Sounds 'grey-area' to me.After spending half a day to go through all the settings and clean up the mess I think I'm ready to use this phone.  I still wonder what else I missed..."
1,Don't buy this mob... Camera performance is worse than 8k mob... Battery backup gives 1days.. On 60ghz..... 15k wasted.. No nfc...  Lost trust on Samsung.
5,My review after a week of usagepros-------*Battery - lasting for 2 days*Display - Great AMOLED display*Separate slot for memory card*Camera is also goodcons-------*Sometime touch is not working.*Battery - taking 3 hours to get fully charged. Nowadays we can get phone charged within 2 hours*Notification light is missing. Every time we need to on the button to check whether we have received any calls or messages*It is said that 15w charger but in adapter it says 10w (5.0 V = 2.0 A)*Too much of unwanted apps are pre-installed*Very outdated processor.
1,I am fully disappointed with this model.perfomance wise not good . Operating app is also slow taking so much time to open and download app .aslo taking so much time to charge after 40 % any mobile take 45 to 60 min to full charge but this mobile take around 90 to 120 min to charge.not worth it .not recommended to any one .
1,Battery Life is very poor .Even though it is 6000 mah battery it doesn't last a full day and needs to be charged atleast twice a dayEven though it is less than one month it's UI constantly stops and have to be closed.The response is extremely poor .I have been using One Plus 5 for the past 2 and half years and its response is better than this new device which is hanging and apps are crashing time and again .I had preferred an Indian phone to Chinese one but have been extremely disappointed with the performance of this phone
2,"I don't suggest to buy this m32 mobile, there is no extra features as they mentioned in their options, there they mentions atmos dolby sound, but third class sound in speakers and that option is not working, secondly palm swipe for screen shot is not working camera is so so, very bad product from samsung, I tried all the ways to take screen shots using palm swipe but I can't, if possible pls replace with another item mr amazon"
1,"This fraud incident happened to me. I bought Samsung Galaxy M32 smartphone on Friday 6th August 2021 online from Amazon and received it on Monday. As soon as I opened the This fraud incident happened to me. I bought Samsung Galaxy M32 smartphone on Friday 6th August 2021 online from Amazon and received it on Monday. As soon as I opened the parcel, I turned on the phone and found that it was defective.There is the issue of no display with this phone. The same day, I requested a replacement, the phone was to be replaced on 13th Aug 2021, delivery agent comes to my residence for replacement but refused to replace the faulty phone saying that the phone has no display and arguing that he requires to dial  *#06# on the defective phone to get  IMEI number for verification which he will feed on amazon's Software.But it is a well-known fact that on any cellular device like Smartphones IMEI no is printed on the phone, their box, and also on the receipt. I asked him to enter the IMEI number printed on the receipt but he refused. Again Iasked him to wait for few minutes and not to cancel the replacement I will talk to customer care to sort out this problem. But he did cancel the replacement. he might do it intentionally to grab the phonelater on Amazon Assured that the amount will be refunded, but to the date, no money has been transferred, i was contacted costumer care of Amazon  again on 13 August for pickup the defective cellphone samsung M32 ,on 14th August agent comes to my residenti and he also refuse to collect , makeing same excuse that you cell phone was ded so that's why I am not able to collect ....So dear those wo are going to buy any products  from Amazon be aware that Amazon team in india is making a Big Scam with their courier agent ...Please be safe and aware don't buy any product form Amazon .Dear readers. If you want to buy any products online use another online cart , like flipkart , Mintra, Mishu , but never from Amazon boycott Amazon ..."
5,"Amazing phone. I would rank it the best overall phone experience. The pros are obviously known to everyone, the 90hz display is great. The touch feel is literally like butter. Cameras are great. Amazon prime runs in HD so widewine l1 is there. Speakers are loud, not tinny but lack bass. Can't complain.Phone requires careful first time setup to avoid ads as suggested by ranjit sir. No ads encountered yet. Everything works well, side mounted power button /finger print reader is fast and accurate. Light sensor, proximity sensor are flawless. These 2 are typically bad in Chinese phones (mi note 5 pro user) causing display to turn on when in call, so thumbs up.The cons: the processor seemed weak on paper, but the experience is great. Not that I am defending samsung, but a compromise 90% can blindly make. I do not play games, so can't say much but better processor phones out there. This is for general public who wants smooth experience of samsung phone and no software bugs.Some complained of emmc5 storage, but apps installed damn fast and I did not find and sluggish read write speed issue. Fast and phone did not heat during setup process when installing 100s of apps and no slowness observed. I have 2 m30s in house, they also pointed out better build quality, better looks of my black version and fluidity of screen. Good for light gaming. Go ahead with the phone for good vibes throughout phones life. Now samsung is giving 3 years of software updates, so great."
1,"Display is good and bright. Battery  average. It's not that speed being 6gb ram, while making  call it lags. Camera not upto mark, I miss grand camera which was better  than 64 mp. Over priced, don't have basic features  of other M series phone. On the name of brand Samsung started cheating people.  They should  atleast  provide  cover."
3,"After purchasing Samsung M12, was looking forward to getting M31, but the mobile was not available and the prices increased. After waiting for a month, saw that M32 is available so purchased it but not entirely happy with it. The phone rings on its own at times, chimes continuously other times without any call or notification being given. Phone lags at time and opening apps also takes time. Perhaps the 6gb variant is better but I have 4gb model. OneUI was supposed to be stable and I am quite disappointed with this particular purchase at least."
1,"This is my first review of Any product purchsed online. I'm shopping online since ages now. But this Phone FORCED me to write a review.I've been Using Asus Zenfone phones till date for my usage, Had a wonderful experience....First time ever shifted to Samsung just because of so called Brand Name.WORST DECISION.Camera OK.Battery OK.Performance OK.Screen OK.Brightness OK.Within 1 week Lock switch stopped working.I'm locking and unlocking by screen tap option because samsung people have said it'll take time to repair.Body completely cheap plastic material.Heats up with normal usage.When in pocket automatically wakes up and starts typing numbers or dials emergency number.With No disregard to Samsung I'm saying very bad phone you've made.Very overpriced. Should be of 9k or less.Others opinions may differ from me. This is just my personal experience.I'm sorry to give you less stars Samsung but please improve your quality not quantity. There is no mandate to launch new phone every week."
4,Pros: Screen resolution is good. Speed and performance is ok ok. Sometimes got little sluggy during parallel execution. Camera is very good quality. Battery life is good. SW is really smooth. Speaker is louder enough. Finally it's not a Chinese brand.Cons: No 4k or HDR video viewing. So some videos are blurry even though it is HD. During charging phone gets heated up. Tats may be it has bigger battery. 5G support is not Der since most phones are now with 5G. Price might have been little less to compete Chinese brands.
1,"purchased this phone on 16999 from Amazon by exchange .but I did not find any quality as per this high price.1. Phone touchscreen is very slow and sometimes hangs stop working.2 while viewing YouTube the voice is not coming clear sometimes voice going up and down , microphone and speaker of this phone is not up to the mark even I should say worst. Of its kind.3 this phone is marketed as 6 gb ram but most of the phone memory is already approx 3 gb is occupied by pre-installed app which you can not remove. This is complete cheating with customer regarding storage.4.in whatsapp I am unable to select the more photos. Its processor is very slow.even slower than my previous phone .Do not waste the money on the premium phone like these.Better go for any other company"
5,"Good camera features,Good display quality,Good battery backup,"
1,Camera quality not good and battery backup very bad.üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†
2,"Best camera quality at 15k Not for gamers only for simple multimedia use and want a secure phone. Yes it lags too much on normal and heavy use .No carrier aggregation by samsung prosser support carrier aggregation only 3 thing is good about this phone camera,display and battery"
5,"Using since last three days ...completely satisfied with everything. In this segment so many phones are available but if i get the SAMSUNG then why i should go anywhere else...Pros:Display - SAMOLED with Full HD, Side Curves make you feel so happy. Brightness is awesome.Sound - Dolby Sound is also good specially with wired headphone.Battery - Without internet 2 days do not worry to charge it and with internet one full day.Call Quality : Also goodVideo Calling - BestCamera : Picture is so goodProcessor - Fast as it comes with 90Hz refresh rate.Cons:Notification LED Indicator is missing but can be managed.RAM could be 8 GB but if you choose the quality then it can be also ignored. 6GB also working fine.Verdict: If you are not a GAMER then blindly you can grab it."
5,"Value for money and best is 90hz super amoled display and 64mp quad camera. Best for listening music and watching videos as it has 6000mah battery goes 1+1/2 day ""but this phone is not for gaming"""
4,"best Non-Chinese smartphone preference under 15K | Excellent battery | Decent Camera | Smooth | Stylish look | Mummy Loved it ( I gifted it to her)Not made for chhapri youth icons of India.Not the best camera phone under 15K.for gaming under 15k > Motorola G40 / POCO is better option.if you are a decent user, who loves to watch videos/ browse social apps then definitely go for this.for Mumma/PAPA this would be best choice rather than Chinese smartphones.(Thumbs UP) BATTERY : Screen On Time > More than 13H for Mumma. she watches Jio Tv & browse social apps quite often.(Processor) MTK G80 doesn't lag much as compare to Exynos processors + it is better optimized for battery consumption. example Samsung M21 2021 with same 6k mAh battery with Exynos processor gives 7-9h Screen on time only, while Samsung m32 with same 6K mAh battery with MTK Processor gives more than 10-12H screen on time."
2,Waste of money. Don't but this phone. I'll not recommend it to anyone. Today I received  this and within 24 hours am reviewing  the product.  It's not worth . Camera is bad. MI is much much much better. I shud have listed to other reviews  before buying this.
2,"Seeing few YouTube videos,I purchase it,  It's 7-Days now.Processor is G80 , Which Don't support 90Hz& Don't support 2k Videos & Pics.,But, People who use for minimum usage like 2-3hr YouTube,  Amazon videos good.Most time it's 60hz , so, u feels Videos üìπlag ,When u take FHD pic it takes 2-4sec to save it.I am feeling M40 which I got 3-years back is much faster..So, Always go with Snapdragon processor.."
5,"The youtuber reviews will tell you that this phone doesn't have a powerful processor that others will offer you at this price range. It is a fantastic mobile for an average user like me. You should have to look what your purpose of the mobile you want purchase. If you want to play games like pubg and you want professional video/photoshoot this phone is not definitely not for you. It is good to watch youtube videos at high quality with samsung's amazing samoled screen, it can take some good photos and videos and can do some games even pubg at minimal settings.I thing like this people who drive  vehicle at a speed of 60 k.m per hour wants a car that have very powerful engine and they will never need that much power. Like that I don't need a very high performing processor and other features that I may not use.So think, if you are a person who only wants to use mobile for to make and take call and watch videos and occasionally wants to play some game, then this mobile is definitely for you.My job is some what risky and I need automatic call recorder to deal with my risky customers. This mobile has that feature. Its my purpose and that's why I bought this phone.Its a good phone an average customer."
5,"In love with this beast in reasonable price, camera quality is really great, screen resolution is far far clear and colour full, battery is strong, light weight, compact size, all required smart phone features are build in the phone. Good job Samsung team."
1,Do not buy. There are plenty of other good options for the price. Main issue is the PROCESSOR.  I just felt it's too slow compared to  the mobiles available.  Phone is also bit thick . And I think its manufacturing is stoped too.  It's only sold online. If I had a chance I would buy a different phone .
4,"Don't waste money on redmi or realme jst in sake for money. This phone is very nice for decent users. It is an all-rounder in all tasks, but for decemt usage. Camera is very nice than redmi, realme, oppo etc. Notch is very small and does not disturb. One UI 3.1 has tons of features to customize. My rating 8.5/10.All the Best!"
5,Great product. Bought it for display and battery.Cons...Processor is not powerful enough to draw 90hz. Battery is also drained so fast while use 90hz refresh rate.So I switched back to 60Hz. Performance improved and battery lasts longer than before.
4,"This phone cannot do much, however, if you are buying this phone, I reckon you are buying it for being a backup to your usual smartphone device or for an older person who usually won't fiddle with the phone all day. Below is a list of features with their ratings (out of 10):1. Camera - 0.3 MP - 5/10 (That was expected)2. Photo Viewer - Cannot zoom in or out a photo - 1/10 (If you can zoom in or out by any means, please let me know)3. Music Player - 10/10 - use a Bluetooth earpiece for better experience.4. Battery Longetivity (1750 mAH)- 10/10 - can stay charged atleast for 2-3 days on usual usage.5. Connectivity to the Internet - 3/10 - Connot open anything more than Google/ Search Engine - Still facinating that it can atleast do so.6. Radio - 10/107. Text Reader - 10/10 - The most facinating feature is Text Reader. You can copy lessons, or any other writings from PC, save them in a '.txt' file, send them to the Text reader folder in the SD card, and use text reader to carry on with your lessons, or stories, or anything.Other features:Calling as usual - dual sim, sound recorder available, torch available, Scheduler, etc."
5,Good budget phone for basic calling use. Decent camera quality for emergency use. Liked the music and fm player. Really clear and nice sound quality
1,"1st and replacement both are provided technically defected product (for1st one Torch was not working, and for replacement one key was not working). Seller was sending renewed or refurbished product in new packet."
1,This phone does not work in abroad countries like Austraila. Totally wastage of money. As a matter of fact this phone is not even supporting my Airtel sim here in Austraila. No signal on both local and Indian sim.
5,"wow what a beautiful mobile phone it is, i loved it, wireless FM, Stylish model, dual sim, good sound quality, long battery life, Screenshot option available, Video player, music player, decent cam and oh yes bright torch too, fully satisfied by the quality of the mobile, if you're planning to but then do buy it soon,"
4,Overall good product at reasonable price
4,Low budget mobile
5,Good
1,Unable to hear properly. I got defective piece.. realized after return window closed thinking that its a network issue.
2,Dislplay quality is not goodSpeaker is not goodUnable to detect sim in slotsCamera is not good
5,Nice battery backup and best in bar phones
2,Charger become very hot within 5 minutes
5,Nice mobile

4,As per price its worth what i was looking for
5,Value for money.
5,"Build is strong and design also fine , good for old people"
5,Nice
4,Good
1,I am not happy that in this phone Jio sim is compulsory. Without jio sim phone is working. In review before we purchase informed that slot 1 is reserved for jio sim but not informed that without jio sim others sim will not active. Therefore I am not happy with this phone
4,Super Mobile
3,I wish it could have worked with any 1 Sim instead of jio only
2,"Not bad, phone is slow, but not bad"
5,this is very cheapest touch screen mobile so that is good.
5,Value for money
1,Quality is bed

5,It's worth for 9.5k. after exchange offer.light weight n thin.easy to use.mobile have fingerprint n facial recognition to unlock and lifespan of battery lasts long.ram n rom are good.worth buying it.camera quality is ok.
2,"It's an average phone. Quite on the pretty side. ONLY those who are looking for a budget phone can think of purchasing this one. The camera is very average, but the functions & controls of the phone are smooth. It's very lightweight - that's a plus!"
5,Its a really very amazing and a nicely working phone..the camera quality and battery is also very goodü§©üòä.liked the product very much
1,Worst mobile . I never expect from oppo such a low grade mobile. Touch is not working. Phone hanging. No return and replacement option.  From Amazon I got bad experience. Don't buy this mobile. Waste of money.
1,It is roadside product with dusty display. When called Amazon customer care she deny to replace item. Don't buy anything from Amazon. Amazon only sells defective items. I returned many items and this was very useless response. She also disconnected call.USELESS AMAZON
1,"when i ordered this phone , headphone is free with phone but received order without headphone"
4,Nice phone value for money but in inbox there is no earphone and screen protector receive being a regular customer of Amazon i am  unhappy there was  clearly written that these items are included in inbox.
1,"Body sensor not working. Was late by 2 days to find out this defect and so could not use ""return"" option.Due to body sensor problem, phone display never gets off while talking and so when brought close to ear, buttons like mute, hold gets activated while speaking.The basic function, which is to talk to others on phone becomes troublesome. Everytime have to very careful of holding position to make sure phone is not touched on body. Hate this and feel cheated/dejected.Cannot return as well."
5,"Nice mobile prices 12,450"
3,i have recently bought this phone..on 18 may 2020.. delivery is good but there was no headphones in a box.features r awesome nd phone is working gud.but camera quality is bit bad.
1,This mobile was used by someone else.I have got someone else's mobile.I am not happy for this mobile.I will not do return this mobile.Because the reason of I give gift for other person.
5,"Oppo always exports premium quality mobiles. Let there be no such features like other mobile but i phone also doesn't export such features at high price, then?I have attached some pictures also you can check them incase you wanna see the picture quality.Hence you can buy this without any tension.Amazing mobile's camera and body quality and display is also good.Go for it I suggest. üòÉ"
1,This product received wrost.. In this item some useful applications not run..Order canceled but no cancelation status and pick up status updating by Amazon..No any contact provided by Amazon..Realy disappoint..
4,"Better to value for money , quality is as per shown ..And fast delivered by amazon."
1,Don't buy it from Amazon the return service of Amazon is very bad..disgusting they never think customer problem no one in call centre never call you return policy and service is very poor only benefit looking cite ... don't buy anything from amazon.. in future I never buy electronics items from Amazon... flipcart is most trusted than amazon
1,Earphones not received in a phone box
1,The phone lags a lot right from the box. You have to swipe 3-4 times. Apps get hung. Never seen such a pathetic phone.
2,This product details said there is a earphone and screen protector.  But i didnt get that
5,The phone is excellent but if the front and rear camara should be high and should be their dark mode compalsary but it should be added fastly and should give ear phonesonly main default is not nice camara should be high because the less cost mobiles will take more tean agers so they do moor selfies so it should increase and oppo is the selfie expert but this phone no selfie expert camara for next phone it should increase .Imay think I will increase
1,"1. Phone don't have type C charging2. Dual app not possible for all app like redmi phones3. Charger is normal 5v 2 Amp so no fast charging.4. Not for multi tasking people.5. Camera and sound average6. Processor and touch very slow7. Only 6GB RAM AND 128 GB ROM is good  in this phone.8. Also it's not showing dual 4G9. Battery is only 1 day at normal uses.10. Display dpi is also very low.11. Can be treated as entry level phone.12. WhatsApp Camera function is abnormal, don't waste money on OPPO A31"
3,"I like the product. But as compared to my other phone Realme X2. I found the lag in processing in some of minor things also. It is having 6GB RAM then also the having some processing issue. I don;t like the product. Even after this specs, the things are getting lag."
1,"Screen quality is very poor , camera is also nearly poor, all over the phone is worst. I ordered this phone by choosing the no cost emi option of Bajaj , but they are also taking the processing charges of Rs.174 on every instalment.So please don‚Äôt use Bajaj‚Äôs emi option for ordering this phone. Thanks"
1,"i have received the waste and damaged products and i chasing the customer support from last 10 days no solution upto now waste of money on  amazon ,waste of time on amazon ,and i customer of amzaon from last 5 years and i am a prime member this is the services i am getting"
3,Updating after 4month :-screen recorder not available..which is default function of every android now a days..-Charging draining faster but charging gaining very slower.-its not a 21st century phone .. so many basic features missing Day 1: experience:-Most important : it will not redirect the link into the present app in mobile .... It will open link every times in default browser..Eg: if I got any Facebook /insta /Twitter link and I already have installed these app then it will not asking me to get open with app instead it will redirect to browser and again I need to login... So so poor technology1.processor looks slow while setup and configuration my account data restoration as compare to redmi note 7 (same price older version phone than this)2. Camera quality is very low both back and front ...capture blurred images..not focusing the face even after setup manually.3.  Not value for money.. I think I made mistake to choose oppo brand .. I compare all the feature with redmi.. redmi looks far better than this..4. No front flash light available to click in night5. Looks slow to handle multiple apps compare to redmi6. Please don't buy this phone..this is so poor technology phone..
3,Headsets are missing in the phone box...where are the original headsets...its normally included in phonebox??
4,Nice mobile in this Price üëåüëåüëåüëå..
4,Nice product...but there is no C pin charger  thts only one prob in this product...
4,"Good product  but as compared to Mi note 8 its not Good . If you want to rought use for bussiness purchase.. Provessor is slow , not for gaming. But want you tube and surffing it's usefull. Another all thing is good .I don't have time for upload pics , but this review is enought.Product is same as photos."
5,Very nice phone for Rs.12500/-
1,Dont buy this it is not worth for money. It is working slow
5,Pros:-1. Display (Best display you can get at this price i.e.  Super Amoled with 90Hz Refresh Rate2. üîã Battery (6000 mAh big battery)3. Camera ( 64 mp) and selfie (20 mp) and if you  know you know samsung image processing  software.4. Looks and back Design ( Awesome Pattern with  rainbow üåà reflection.)5. Compact Size (6.4inches) not too big and not  too small.......handy..Cons:-1. Processor (mediatek helio g80) which is a low  end processor and it might not affect your  overall performance if you are not a heavy  gamer or something like that.2. Infinity U display. Nowadays drop notch display  is kinda outdated look since overall look of the  phone is great but this small thing is like a black  spot on a white chart paper.##But Also keep that in Mind how can you get  everything in just 14999 -17999 ........in mid  range...these specs are perfect and at last you  can trust the brand name too.üòè
4,Cons:1.Good phone at this price.2.Display Quality is really great. Looks premium3.Camera is also very nice in daylight. In indoor it takes some shacky images.4. For Normal use I think it is best phone considering Samsung √Ämoled display and security.CONS:1. Could have been better if it comes with strong processor2. Samsung should have provided a Back case3. This phones support 25w charger but only 15w charger is provided so there must be 25w charger in the box
4,"I am sure there will be many reviewers who will do an in-depth analysis and list out the pros and cons of the device. So here i am pointing out the negatives that i felt . First thing first, the ring volume is mediocre. Ring is not at all loud and i wondee whether I have recieved a faulty device.Second thing i loathe is that, the back cover is a fingerprint magnet. Some kind of resin or composite material is used.To be honest, i didn't like the phone much. The design is outdated and sub par a 10k phone. Since bought this for an elderly person, the ring volume was a total bummer for me. Thats it, another useless review from me."
1,"I purchased this phone on 16999 from Amazon by exchange .but I did not find any quality as per this high price.1.

1,"Big major charging issue, charging icon is seen during charging but charging is not increased, that's a very bad or not exceptable by samsungConclusion- company target is money making not making a quality device üò°Now my money is loss and we are crying üò≠üíîüò¢"
1,"Believe me, it's the slowest mobile I saw. Don't go on screen and Battery, it is an extremely slow mobile phone and takes ages to open and navigate. Forget about heavy use, it can't handle normal regular use. I made a huge mistake but pls don't buy this mobile. It's only a few months and I am thinking to change it. Its dam SLOW SLOW SLOW."
1,"So greatful to Amazon for sending me such a nice product which has already landed in samsung service centre twice within one month of purchase, it was possible only when amazon refused to take back the product within the return period even though they've so called 'no questions asked' return policy.Above all Samsung did a great jod too by keeping the phone with themselves for 10 days now, sometimes I forget that I just bought a new phone because either it's not with me most of the times or it is sick.Lastly Amazon didn't even bother to reply back to my grievances.Hats off to you guys."
1,Samsung  is forcing the user to install all the junk applications  in our phone.even the Ota update installing the junks.Performce of the phone is pretty decent.Camera is also giving the good shots but the junk app spoiling the party.More than a samsung phone you are purchasing  bundle of junk applications
1,Worst camera. Seems like camera of local phone.  Returning this back.Too heavy. Don‚Äôt know why they are considering that 64 mp. Poor camera quality.
1,1. Heavy heat on both the sides. Front and back also.2. Charging is very slow.
1,Terrible phone. Always hang and unusable. Returning the product. Don't but this
5,"Processer is good.Both side Camera performance is good.Camera functions is work properly.In Screen look use face sacaner than fingerprint.Provide pre-installed apps Samsung system,  Microsoft system, Google system and Netflix's ,Amazon, etc.Charging capacity is too low, take 1¬Ω hr to charge.Fingerprint sacaner too small, many times its doesn't match.Lots of app pre-installed.25GB memory used out of 128."
3,"I'm a just a basic user of phones.  No movies, no games.  I mainly use phone, messages, photos, chats and other social apps and some utilities.  For the price, the features seem impressive and for my mild usage this phone sounds great.What I did not like is the amount of apps that were already installed on the phone!  Then I had to un-select a whole bunch of ""recommended"" apps during setup.  I was pre-subscribed to 'diagnostics' and 'recommendation' and 'marketing' notification by default!  Is that allowed?  Some features don't work unless I use specific apps.  Basically, they are app features and not phone features.  Sounds 'grey-area' to me.After spending half a day to go through all the settings and clean up the mess I think I'm ready to use this phone.  I still wonder what else I missed..."
1,Don't buy this mob... Camera performance is worse than 8k mob... Battery backup gives 1days.. On 60ghz..... 15k wasted.. No nfc...  Lost trust on Samsung.
5,My review after a week of usagepros-------*Battery - lasting for 2 days*Display - Great AMOLED display*Separate slot for memory card*Camera is also goodcons-------*Sometime touch is not working.*Battery - taking 3 hours to get fully charged. Nowadays we can get phone charged within 2 hours*Notification light is missing. Every time we need to on the button to check whether we have received any calls or messages*It is said that 15w charger but in adapter it says 10w (5.0 V = 2.0 A)*Too much of unwanted apps are pre-installed*Very outdated processor.
1,I am fully disappointed with this model.perfomance wise not good . Operating app is also slow taking so much time to open and download app .aslo taking so much time to charge after 40 % any mobile take 45 to 60 min to full charge but this mobile take around 90 to 120 min to charge.not worth it .not recommended to any one .
1,Battery Life is very poor .Even though it is 6000 mah battery it doesn't last a full day and needs to be charged atleast twice a dayEven though it is less than one month it's UI constantly stops and have to be closed.The response is extremely poor .I have been using One Plus 5 for the past 2 and half years and its response is better than this new device which is hanging and apps are crashing time and again .I had preferred an Indian phone to Chinese one but have been extremely disappointed with the performance of this phone
2,"I don't suggest to buy this m32 mobile, there is no extra features as they mentioned in their options, there they mentions atmos dolby sound, but third class sound in speakers and that option is not working, secondly palm swipe for screen shot is not working camera is so so, very bad product from samsung, I tried all the ways to take screen shots using palm swipe but I can't, if possible pls replace with another item mr amazon"
1,"This fraud incident happened to me. I bought Samsung Galaxy M32 smartphone on Friday 6th August 2021 online from Amazon and received it on Monday. As soon as I opened the This fraud incident happened to me. I bought Samsung Galaxy M32 smartphone on Friday 6th August 2021 online from Amazon and received it on Monday. As soon as I opened the parcel, I turned on the phone and found that it was defective.There is the issue of no display with this phone. The same day, I requested a replacement, the phone was to be replaced on 13th Aug 2021, delivery agent comes to my residence for replacement but refused to replace the faulty phone saying that the phone has no display and arguing that he requires to dial  *#06# on the defective phone to get  IMEI number for verification which he will feed on amazon's Software.But it is a well-known fact that on any cellular device like Smartphones IMEI no is printed on the phone, their box, and also on the receipt. I asked him to enter the IMEI number printed on the receipt but he refused. Again Iasked him to wait for few minutes and not to cancel the replacement I will talk to customer care to sort out this problem. But he did cancel the replacement. he might do it intentionally to grab the phonelater on Amazon Assured that the amount will be refunded, but to the date, no money has been transferred, i was contacted costumer care of Amazon  again on 13 August for pickup the defective cellphone samsung M32 ,on 14th August agent comes to my residenti and he also refuse to collect , makeing same excuse that you cell phone was ded so that's why I am not able to collect ....So dear those wo are going to buy any products  from Amazon be aware that Amazon team in india is making a Big Scam with their courier agent ...Please be safe and aware don't buy any product form Amazon .Dear readers. If you want to buy any products online use another online cart , like flipkart , Mintra, Mishu , but never from Amazon boycott Amazon ..."
5,"Amazing phone. I would rank it the best overall phone experience. The pros are obviously known to everyone, the 90hz display is great. The touch feel is literally like butter. Cameras are great. Amazon prime runs in HD so widewine l1 is there. Speakers are loud, not tinny but lack bass. Can't complain.Phone requires careful first time setup to avoid ads as suggested by ranjit sir. No ads encountered yet. Everything works well, side mounted power button /finger print reader is fast and accurate. Light sensor, proximity sensor are flawless. These 2 are typically bad in Chinese phones (mi note 5 pro user) causing display to turn on when in call, so thumbs up.The cons: the processor seemed weak on paper, but the experience is great. Not that I am defending samsung, but a compromise 90% can blindly make. I do not play games, so can't say much but better processor phones out there. This is for general public who wants smooth experience of samsung phone and no software bugs.Some complained of emmc5 storage, but apps installed damn fast and I did not find and sluggish read write speed issue. Fast and phone did not heat during setup process when installing 100s of apps and no slowness observed. I have 2 m30s in house, they also pointed out better build quality, better looks of my black version and fluidity of screen. Good for light gaming. Go ahead with the phone for good vibes throughout phones life. Now samsung is giving 3 years of software updates, so great."
1,"Display is good and bright. Battery  average. It's not that speed being 6gb ram, while making  call it lags. Camera not upto mark, I miss grand camera which was better  than 64 mp. Over priced, don't have basic features  of other M series phone. On the name of brand Samsung started cheating people.  They should  atleast  provide  cover."
3,"After purchasing Samsung M12, was looking forward to getting M31, but the mobile was not available and the prices increased. After waiting for a month, saw that M32 is available so purchased it but not entirely happy with it. The phone rings on its own at times, chimes continuously other times without any call or notification being given. Phone lags at time and opening apps also takes time. Perhaps the 6gb variant is better but I have 4gb model. OneUI was supposed to be stable and I am quite disappointed with this particular purchase at least."
1,"This is my first review of Any product purchsed online. I'm shopping online since ages now. But this Phone FORCED me to write a review.I've been Using Asus Zenfone phones till date for my usage, Had a wonderful experience....First time ever shifted to Samsung just because of so called Brand Name.WORST DECISION.Camera OK.Battery OK.Performance OK.Screen OK.Brightness OK.Within 1 week Lock switch stopped working.I'm locking and unlocking by screen tap option because samsung people have said it'll take time to repair.Body completely cheap plastic material.Heats up with normal usage.When in pocket automatically wakes up and starts typing numbers or dials emergency number.With No disregard to Samsung I'm saying very bad phone you've made.Very overpriced. Should be of 9k or less.Others opinions may differ from me. This is just my personal experience.I'm sorry to give you less stars Samsung but please improve your quality not quantity. There is no mandate to launch new phone every week."
4,Pros: Screen resolution is good. Speed and performance is ok ok. Sometimes got little sluggy during parallel execution. Camera is very good quality. Battery life is good. SW is really smooth. Speaker is louder enough. Finally it's not a Chinese brand.Cons: No 4k or HDR video viewing. So some videos are blurry even though it is HD. During charging phone gets heated up. Tats may be it has bigger battery. 5G support is not Der since most phones are now with 5G. Price might have been little less to compete Chinese brands.
1,"purchased this phone on 16999 from Amazon by exchange .but I did not find any quality as per this high price.1. Phone touchscreen is very slow and sometimes hangs stop working.2 while viewing YouTube the voice is not coming clear sometimes voice going up and down , microphone and speaker of this phone is not up to the mark even I should say worst. Of its kind.3 this phone is marketed as 6 gb ram but most of the phone memory is already approx 3 gb is occupied by pre-installed app which you can not remove. This is complete cheating with customer regarding storage.4.in whatsapp I am unable to select the more photos. Its processor is very slow.even slower than my previous phone .Do not waste the money on the premium phone like these.Better go for any other company"
5,"Good camera features,Good display quality,Good battery backup,"
1,Camera quality not good and battery backup very bad.üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†
2,"Best camera quality at 15k Not for gamers only for simple multimedia use and want a secure phone. Yes it lags too much on normal and heavy use .No carrier aggregation by samsung prosser support carrier aggregation only 3 thing is good about this phone camera,display and battery"
5,"Using since last three days ...completely satisfied with everything. In this segment so many phones are available but if i get the SAMSUNG then why i should go anywhere else...Pros:Display - SAMOLED with Full HD, Side Curves make you feel so happy. Brightness is awesome.Sound - Dolby Sound is also good specially with wired headphone.Battery - Without internet 2 days do not worry to charge it and with internet one full day.Call Quality : Also goodVideo Calling - BestCamera : Picture is so goodProcessor - Fast as it comes with 90Hz refresh rate.Cons:Notification LED Indicator is missing but can be managed.RAM could be 8 GB but if you choose the quality then it can be also ignored. 6GB also working fine.Verdict: If you are not a GAMER then blindly you can grab it."
5,"Value for money and best is 90hz super amoled display and 64mp quad camera. Best for listening music and watching videos as it has 6000mah battery goes 1+1/2 day ""but this phone is not for gaming"""
4,"best Non-Chinese smartphone preference under 15K | Excellent battery | Decent Camera | Smooth | Stylish look | Mummy Loved it ( I gifted it to her)Not made for chhapri youth icons of India.Not the best camera phone under 15K.for gaming under 15k > Motorola G40 / POCO is better option.if you are a decent user, who loves to watch videos/ browse social apps then definitely go for this.for Mumma/PAPA this would be best choice rather than Chinese smartphones.(Thumbs UP) BATTERY : Screen On Time > More than 13H for Mumma. she watches Jio Tv & browse social apps quite often.(Processor) MTK G80 doesn't lag much as compare to Exynos processors + it is better optimized for battery consumption. example Samsung M21 2021 with same 6k mAh battery with Exynos processor gives 7-9h Screen on time only, while Samsung m32 with same 6K mAh battery with MTK Processor gives more than 10-12H screen on time."
2,Waste of money. Don't but this phone. I'll not recommend it to anyone. Today I received  this and within 24 hours am reviewing  the product.  It's not worth . Camera is bad. MI is much much much better. I shud have listed to other reviews  before buying this.
2,"Seeing few YouTube videos,I purchase it,  It's 7-Days now.Processor is G80 , Which Don't support 90Hz& Don't support 2k Videos & Pics.,But, People who use for minimum usage like 2-3hr YouTube,  Amazon videos good.Most time it's 60hz , so, u feels Videos üìπlag ,When u take FHD pic it takes 2-4sec to save it.I am feeling M40 which I got 3-years back is much faster..So, Always go with Snapdragon processor.."
5,"The youtuber reviews will tell you that this phone doesn't have a powerful processor that others will offer you at this price range. It is a fantastic mobile for an average user like me. You should have to look what your purpose of the mobile you want purchase. If you want to play games like pubg and you want professional video/photoshoot this phone is not definitely not for you. It is good to watch youtube videos at high quality with samsung's amazing samoled screen, it can take some good photos and videos and can do some games even pubg at minimal settings.I thing like this people who drive  vehicle at a speed of 60 k.m per hour wants a car that have very powerful engine and they will never need that much power. Like that I don't need a very high performing processor and other features that I may not use.So think, if you are a person who only wants to use mobile for to make and take call and watch videos and occasionally wants to play some game, then this mobile is definitely for you.My job is some what risky and I need automatic call recorder to deal with my risky customers. This mobile has that feature. Its my purpose and that's why I bought this phone.Its a good phone an average customer."
5,"In love with this beast in reasonable price, camera quality is really great, screen resolution is far far clear and colour full, battery is strong, light weight, compact size, all required smart phone features are build in the phone. Good job Samsung team."
1,Do not buy. There are plenty of other good options for the price. Main issue is the PROCESSOR.  I just felt it's too slow compared to  the mobiles available.  Phone is also bit thick . And I think its manufacturing is stoped too.  It's only sold online. If I had a chance I would buy a different phone .
4,"Don't waste money on redmi or realme jst in sake for money. This phone is very nice for decent users. It is an all-rounder in all tasks, but for decemt usage. Camera is very nice than redmi, realme, oppo etc. Notch is very small and does not disturb. One UI 3.1 has tons of features to customize. My rating 8.5/10.All the Best!"
5,Great product. Bought it for display and battery.Cons...Processor is not powerful enough to draw 90hz. Battery is also drained so fast while use 90hz refresh rate.So I switched back to 60Hz. Performance improved and battery lasts longer than before.
1,"Phone is good but lready used, FB messenger logged in with unknown ID. Top transparent sheet missing on phones screen, Frequently hanging during usage. Phone already updated it's meant used phone. Unable to replace. Unable to register complaint. Please help."

1,I wasted my money. Lots of hangings and very slow. Network issues. This is not a 5G or even equal to 1G. Please do not buy this and waste your money. I asked for a refund but Amazon saying is can be replaceable. Not a good service by Amazon and don't know why they are selling such a third class mobile.
4,Mobile is good but net profile working is very slow. I am using airtel 4g sim but not working properly.Camera is not good.
5,Very good display and in hand feel is great. Good camera and it works decent in low light. Great battery life. Overall good phone. I got good first day offer discounts also. Colour os after update is working very smoothly and giving a great user experience.
1,"Recently I ordered it, while recording video from front camera, screen is becoming white and also the video,Also while normal uses, it hanging and screen is becoming black.This experience is necessary for the people who are going to buy new mobile with their hard earned money.Take care."
5,Best mid range 5G smartphone by OPPO.Pros :1. 5G support2. Clean Color OS by OPPO.3. Fast Charging with massive battery.4. Sound quality is decent.5. Light weight & handy phone.Cons :1. Camera needs improvement.2. Feels little bit bulky design.3. OPPO should provide earphones with box.
5,"My usecase - I replaced by secondary phone Redmi Note 4 - wanted to 5G phone with good battery and Sub 15K price tag. Primary use as a GPS navigation in car, Gaming and backup Hotspot phonePros -1) Very lightweight and extremely well built2) ColorOS is flawless - simple, elegant and bug free3) Decently fast phone and responds to quick touches well - especially while using at 90hz4) Able to handle games easily - its a future proof chipset5) Aesthetically, no concerns - decent phone to carry around6) Great connectivity with my various bluetooth enabled devices - My Bose 700 soundbar, Oppo Enco X TWS and even my fitbit smart band.7) Surprisingly good video call quality on selfie camera8) rear Camera setup - since not my primary phone, but if i have to rate it, i will give it 7/10.Cons -1) 18w is a decent charging adapter - but if u r used to faster charging, this will dissapoint you2) screen brightness is good, but being an ips LCD display, it will still keep you wanting more3)Mono Speakers are decent but not loud enough."
2,"I am writing my open review of this phone after using approximately 18daysPhone looks very good look wise 5 out of 5 üåüCamera quiliy is good but not expected from this price pointPhone some times working slow, something I feel I am using my old phone, it means phone performance is not match from my expectations, On this price we should have to buy another phones."
1,"The product which I got, it's not charging even after 4-5 hrs of continuous charging, frequent hanging, and d touch sensor s not dat much great compared to other products, I experience  frequent black outs even, it's disgusting to use this product"
3,"Phone design and look is ok... Camera quality is average (as I bought it for only 14000) it could be a way better.The phone has unique manufacturing defect that it gives error message while using that |the phone temperature is very high"" and automatically phone data and other programme stop working...Even the phone body not heat that much... This is the major issue as you can't use mobile data or camera without restarting the phone or leave for 10minute hold..."
4,Phone was awasome in its price range.there only 2 problems for this phone1 call recording it says when we start call recording. And auto call recording was only for contacts in mobile.2 mobile heat issue while charging.
5,"Very nice phone, I brought it at an offer period, but it cost is little bit more,Battery backup decentCamera clarify very goodPerformance... Very nice...Snapdragon Proceccer is the best compare to mediatek. Budget friendly phone, 128 gb and extra slot for increasing memory, 6 gb ram... Very good... Face recognition system and finger print sensor are awesome....."
1,"Pathetic camera quality, network connectivity and video call picture & voice. Voice is coming broken. I request everyone who is willing to buy this phone, please please don't buy this phone, specially when u r willing to buy from Amazon. They r cheating with customers. On 2nd day i tried to return this mobile but they r not returning it, they want to send technician. What technician can do with the camera quality."
3,Phone is heavy. Annoying app in phone which you cannot remove. No one will write about the bloatware. This is data stealing strategy adopted by big players in market. I wonder after paying 18k for phone still I have to deal with bloatware. It's better to take phone with stock android like Micromax.
1,Never ever buy this phone. This is a failed model. Camera quality and performance is below 1 star. Battery life is half an hour if you are streaming videos and plus it takes more than an hour to charge which is opposite to company's commitment. This is completely waste of money.The below review is for Amazon company.Plus whe I tried to return they asked me arrange for visit at home to check the phone. The technician did not show up however they updated on system that the visit was completed which is wrong.
4,The Product is nice the Only issue is with Charging time. It claims 18W fast charging but taking more than usual to charge. It took around 120 minutes to charge from 41-100%. Either the charger supply is underrated or company is claiming it wrong.
3,"on the time of call recording other person knows the this call is going to record, Screan recording issue."
1,"I am not able to connect my Bluetooth with it, and it has a hanging problem too, I can't send a video call from the phone , I am not able to accept the video call, the calling sound quality is not that great üòí"
2,"It takes 145 minutes to full charge.Facing issues with sim slot1.Camera is normal as other oppo phones.Battery life is good.It could have been cheaper.Front camera is 8 mp ,it could have been better."
5,Best smart phone I have purchased so far in such reasonable price with exchange of my old phone I got Rs 4000 discount. There are lots of advance and useful features in this phone which will give you the feeling like the costly phones. Great feeling in hand like a chocolate bar and you want to bite it. Excellent design.
3,"I am writing this review after three and half month of purchase. I have purchased a few mobiles beforr but never got so much frustrated like this one. As per my opinion, not worth the money, typing is the worst experience for me as well as the sound quality. I do neither play games nor watch movies, so no review for that.If you are a phone addicted person, then you shouldn't go for this one. Touch quality os also very poor in comparison with money. Overall comparing with price my rating is maximum 2.7/5."
2,"Device is little heavy. Camera quality is average and not appear of 48 mega pixel. Camera quality has really disappointed me. Screen is also not soothing for eyes. Overall, it's doesn't satisfy the brand reputation and money spent on it."
5,"This mobile phone is the best phone available under ‚Çπ 20,000 with 5G technology.  Here are some of the features of this phone:Pros -1. Cheapest phone with a 5G snapdragon processor, dedicated memory card slot with two SIMs.2. It's dual 5G phone which means you don't need to change the SIM slot to change the 5G usage between two service providers.3. 6 GB RAM which can be enhanced by 5 GB extra.4. Good battery life. It is running almost 40-45 hours with descent usage which includes WhatsApp, news reading and other daily usage with 4-5 hours of wi-fi support to laptop.5. Supports almost all the features required in a mobile of this category with many shortcuts.Cons -1. Doesn't have IR blaster which is required to use it as a remote control.2. Camera is decent but could have been better.3. Size is little large for men but almost all the phones are coming with this size only and hence, we don't have options.4. Too many pre-installed apps which can't be removed/uninstalled/disabled.There are other phones in the competition but all others lack some or other feature e.g. dedicated memory card slot or snapdragon processor (as mediatek processors are leading in 5G race)."
5,"Being an IT Head I always look for tech specifications of a mobile before purchasing the same.  After a lot of browsing, reading about specifications about the latest mobiles 6GB+128GB, I've selected this product to gift this product to my Daughter on her birthday. A little bit confusion was there about the product. But when my daughter received it, she is very happy about the specification & about the look. The glossy finishing of the back is too pretty. My daughter has installed the 'Genshin Impact' in this mobile, it is running very smooth way. And I've checked all of the functions of the same. Camera resolutions is too good. One of the best product."
1,I got a faulty product so I have raised a complaint to exchange but they don't have this phone in stock
4,"Though it's relatively new. I loke this phone. It's fast, clear cam with many options.Battery backup is good as of now.Being into marketing, my phone usage is very high. Also I watch movies and play games.Still it gives 24 hr backup with everything.As of now, I am liking it."
5,Just loved it ....Cons: 90hz refresh rate is just awesome .Finger print sensors are too good and even face lock.The processor is smooth and the battery is just love easily last for 1.5 days with normal use and a day with heavy use.Cons : I haven't found any cons.
4,"It's a choice able budget 5G smart phone. Very good looks, built quality decent, performance smooth, display and touch excellent, battery acceptable, voice and sound quality very good, no network issue, no heating issues, but cameras not good at all. SAR value is low in this segment 5G(Head: 1.066 & Body:0.607).Though it's the review after 18 hrs of uses. The actual review will be done after 1month of uses."
5,Looking is awesome and stylish look ...I feel it's quite better and budget 5g phone.  Performance also very good..go for it...
5,"Phone is very good. Box comes with phone case(synthetic) also phone has temper glass sticked to it, No heating , Just used it for a day, Good battery backup"
1,Sound quality is not good
5,"6bg with 128gb is sufficient for regular use. 2 days of using with 6-7hr approx talk and mail , WhatsApp network usgae. Battery goodCharging time little longer compared to other models fast charging I m not quite happy as it takes 2 hrs for complete charge.Overall 8/10"

5,Camera and battery life is very very good and this phone comes with 90 hz refresh rate and 5G that‚Äôs make this phone very awesome in middle range budget phones.I am a iOS user so I am purchased this phone for my mother and My mom very happy after getting this.Thanks Amazon and Appario üëå
5,"One of the best phone within 16-17k range. Purchased for 15k.Good and fluid performance, good camera, easy to handle, body weight ratio is good. Can easily handle by one hand. Outdoor pics r good, indoor pics r OK. Can easily handle multiple tasks. Battery back up is excellent.In the midrange it's one of the best phones, don't compare with phones above 50k."
1,"I was happy to get the phone at a price 17k. However, the feeling is vanising slowly as the phone screen is glitchy(during audio calls the display vanishes and appear like a CRT TV without cable connection-signal noise on screen). This is my second phone from OPPO and both times made me hate the company more."
3,"Performance wise good but seems I received used/Someone returned phone.Screen guard, and multiple apps telling this is used. FB, YouTube,YouTube Music, music party, Music, Gpay, flipkart, Amazon, Hey fun, hey tap, like gaming related, photos related, space related like clone, Google drive etc and Many apps are available. I would like to return but took it on Emi basis and need phone.Is this issue from Oppo or Amazon? Not satisfied and no feeling that I bought a new phone"
3,Good 5g phone from oppo....Features and everything is fine but only disappointment is the camera as I was expecting a better camera as such price from oppo. But camera is just OK.
1,"Hi All, don't buy a nokia product during launch.I purchased nokia 6.1 plus for ‚Çπ17500, soon after around 6 months the same phone is available for ‚Çπ9000. It is exactly sold lesser than the launch price.Moreover the phone is not upto the mark. I face charging point issue every 4 - 6 months, I am paying 1.5 k every time. No proper response and solution from Nokia. Nokia has lost its quality."
1,Phone does not support 5GHz broadband speed.screen protector (preinstalled) is not tempered glass.Received July update for Android 11.
3,In the era of slik design nokia is producing bulgy phone.it is not having even g80 ..in which gen nokia is in?not even mentioned what type of ram.i don't know who gonna buy it?kindly improve bulid quality and design
5,"I have been using a 32GB Nokia 6.1 for the last 3 years. Nokia 6.1 was an Android One phone which gave me two Annual Android updates (from Android 8 to Android 10) and 3 years of security patches. The security patches stopped with the April Patch. This was the time I decided that I must now look for a new phone to continue to get monthly security patches and Android updates.Nokia G20 is not the ideal phone to replace a still sturdy Nokia 6.1. I did not see any other suitable Android One phone in the market to meet my expectations, so I settled on the Nokia G20 because of its ready availability.My 32 GB Nokia 6.1 was very tight on storage space and I had to regularly delete some files I would have preferred to keep. So I wanted a Nokia phone with 128 GB of storage that started with Android 11. Currently, I did not find any. So I compromised on a 64 GB Nokia G20.Before using the new phone I merged the contents of my and my wife's camera and WhatsApp pictures using a PC.  I did this so that I can continue to maintain them using the Google photos storage captured from two different phones. Now I had all the pictures taken on my wife's phone as well as the pictures she received on her WhatsApp. The merged contents from a 64 GB Nokia 6.1 and a Nokia 32 GB Nokia 6.1 could fit within a 64 GB Nokia G20 after deleting short-term Good Morning type messages.When the Nokia G20 arrived I charged it and copied the contents of my old Nokia 6.1 contents on the Nokia G20 from Google Cloud. This process did not go through as smoothly as my past experiences were. I did a factory reset of the Nokia G20 couple of times and still, it did not help. Things were not smoothly installing from Google Play Store. A few Apps did not get installed because they were very old and Google decided that they will not work in a new environment. Some old Apps, though they were working on my old phone had been removed in the Play Store and could not be found. Because of these anomalies, the automated restore process did not go through smoothly, and the App icons did not get restored on the screen.  So I manually installed all the remaining Apps from the Play Store and copied the App Icons to their familiar place on the screen. After restarting the phone everything seemed fine.Now I started WhatsApp on the new phone and restored the WhatsApp backup and it worked okay. Till now my sims were in the old phone and now I moved the sims to the new phone and everything seemed fine. After taking a WhatsApp backup and Google backup I was now ready to copy merged contents from the PC.The copy process from the PC to the phone took a long time because of the large number of small files. Everything now works fine and I can see the merged photo gallery. I once again backed up WhatsApp and Google photos to the cloud and now everything is fine and I still have 26 GB of storage for future expansion.Some of my observations:Moving from the 1080x1920 Nokia 6.1 to the 720x1600 Nokia G20 is restricting the screen area.  I knew that I will be making this compromise because of my other choices.For many years now I have been used to the fingerprint scanner on the back and it took a little bit of time to get used to the one on the right largely used with the thumb,In my earlier phone, the VI connection was almost always absent while the Airtel connection was active through the WiFi calling option and VoLTE enablement. I was surprised to find that in the new phone both the sims supported WiFi calling and VoLTE. So my VI connection now has better connectivity in the new phone at my location.Earlier when I read about the Mediatek G35 chipset I noticed that the chipset supported only a 13MP +13MP or 25MP camera and I was wondering how could it support a 64MP camera. Taking pictures I have figured out that the phone normally takes 4000*3000 pixels or 12 MP photos with 1.60-micrometer pixel size.  My Nokia 6.1 had Zeiss 16 MP camera with 1.0-micrometer pixel size and this was again a compromise. I will retain my Nokia 6.1 if I really need to take 16 MP pictures. It is possible to take a 48MP pixels picture using 0.8-micrometer pixels. At this low pixel size, image quality is expected to be poor because of the smaller pixel size and the interference between the adjacent pixels. When 12 MP photos are taken four 0.8-micrometer pixels join together through a process known as pixel-binning to function as a single 1.6-micrometer pixel.I have now been having this phone only for the last 3 days and my impression of the phone is based on what I have read and observed. I don't think I will be able to use this phone for full 3 years as I have used my Nokia 6.1. Whenever my service providers start supporting 5G at that time I will have to replace this phone with a 5G phone from Nokia. Till then this is a good cheap phone with some compromises because of my need for monthly security patches on an Android 11.I am satisfied with the new Nokia G20 as it meets my needs. I don't think I will run out of storage very soon as new pictures will only be 12MP and not 48MP about which I was concerned earlier."
5,"I bought this mobile for my parents, and their major use is WhatsApp, some social networks, commuting and banking apps. And they look for a phone which has a good battery backup, large screen and decent performance. G20 is a right fit for them. Build quality is sturdy. Go for it if you are not looking for a phone for gaming etc.,"
2,"Nokia G 20 has randomly restart issue for every 2-3 hours on my brand new mobile. Approached Nokia customer care and they couldn't resolve the issue. Worried on this purchase. Requested for replacement.I am loyal customer for Nokia, never faced this sort of issue ever before."
5,"For the price it's more than your monies worth, especially if you see the prices of some other brands in the same category. Working well, nicely designed and what else does one want? Go for it."
4,"Writing this rivew after 1 day use. If you're looking for desi mobile like avoid China wala phone then nokia is great option for you. When you start your phone very first time you love the sound of nokia with welcome screen, phone will take an update of 276 MB which will take half hour for setup. Design is good but expecting some basic features like basic headphones in pack, notification light missing, some times proximity sensor not working properly i.e when you talk on your phone and place your phone on ear, screen's light automatically goes off, some time it feels lag while using frequently camera or any application. Battery and camera is good at this price. I think battery will go for 2 days. As I mentioned above little lag issue which I have faced it's not good for gamers. If you are a basic user or wanna gift this stuff to your parents and grandparents go for it, ha Nokia ringtone lagana na bhule you will love that sound."
1,"I am changing this review, because, accidentally, when I tried zooming while capturing a video, I was able to see some of the grains. I have scheduled a technician visit. Will update once the issue is solved. Hopefully, I will be able to return the phone"
1,"The main reason I bought this phone is that I heard that Nokia provides regular MONTHLY security updates. But today is 2nd November, 2021 but still have not received October,2021 security update. If Nokia can't provide regular security updates then there is no point to buy Nokia smartphones.Update: I have recieved the October 2021 security update on 5th November 2021. This is not expected from a Android one phone. October update should be delivered by October only. There are many other phone manufacturer in market who sell phones cheaper than Nokia, only advantage of Nokia is their andoid phones are all android one phones and any one wants regular updates would want to buy it. But if Nokia also can't provide security update on time then there is no advantage for Nokia and current Nokia owners will buy another brand phone next time."
1,"Read carefullyIf you use smartphone 3-4 years then it's same like this..Speed is almost same of 3 years old technology phone.Build quality is ok but processor is almost dead.Think twice if you wanna purchase itHonestly says don't buy this handset.I know that Amazon can't post this review,they want to sell this and make our fool"
4,"I have always used Nokia phones from school days itself.  I still have a Nokia lumina 730 and a Nokia X phone at home both of them still works fine. When I went through the spec sheet of g20 there is nothing much to brag about. But I have been using it for a while now. It works beautifully for sending mails, zoom meetings and occasional social media. The phone has excellent call quality.  Also pure android interface is clutter free. Looks premium and solid to hold. The package was slightly damaged and unlike older Nokia phones there is no tamper proof seal. HMD has to definitely improve on that part. Phone camera has great output in average lighting conditions. I bought it for data security and the bloat ware free OS. EXCELLENT PHONE FOR THE PRICE. Yes you will get Chinese brands with better specs. But this one meets my purpose."
4,"The phone is simple and safe. OS update for two years and safety update for three years are added advantages. No heating problem even after watching movies and web series for hours. No pre-installed un-necessary apps. Good battery life. 1.5 days even after watching web series is not a problem. Compromises are display quality, camera quality and slow processor. However, if you are not high end game player to than the slow speed is not a problem. You can have a high end DSLR for photography. No mobile can compete with a DSLR. But the phone has very typical problems. Taking screen shot is a pain. Going back to the previous web page, especially in Facebook is not possible. These problems are surprisingly there in the phone."
4,Got this phone after my 6.1 and wanted a bargain.Biggest pro is good hardware equal to QC 665 chipset at a low price. Nokia build quality and good cameras and clear loud sound. The main camera has a good night mode which was a surprise. You don't need to charge everyday.Screen guard and good quality silicon cover included.Cons here it is bit heavy. The stock Android 11 is very new and I seen few apps just closing. No back button so need to use gestures. Hopefully the software will improve. The phone takes noticibly longer to start. Frame is ok plastic build.Update after 2 weeks: good performance but noticed the phone did not restart normally onfew occasions. The new Android seems to be very buggy.

2,"UPDATE - Review after using for a month:Pros:Look and design are fantasticStock android gives an ad free experienceComes with pre-installed screen guard along with a transparent protective caseCons:Fingerprint sensor is not consistent. Sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Disappointed with thisTouch response is slowReally tough to switch between apps during callsSlow in response when trying to view media with more than 500 filesSlow in response while unlockingWhen you are in a call and if you need to use any app, it becomes really tough to switch as the phone does not respondTaking lot of time while opening applicationsOverall, performance should have much  better for this price. Would not recommend this to others"
1,"Very poor performance and you can not return it. You have to live what you get. It can only be replaced only if their technician visits you and Mark it as a problem which certainly does not happen. Moreover even if you get a replacement, it will be of not use. The device performance is very poor. Not sure how one can give it a 5 star? Not expected from brand like Nokia and a very poor customer support from Amazon."
1,"Worst phone I had ever used. Such a poor product from Nokia. Not at all worth buying.Too slow, functions are not proper, you cannot create multiple copies of whatsapp if you are using dual simColor combination is not proper. Other phones in this category are getting are far better.Takes a lot of time to recharge"
4,"Phone is ok but screen is very lengthy, it's not looking good"
5,"The phone is well built, looks smart and works well. This phone is ideal for those who want clean android on a limited budget, and those who don't play demanding games. The camera is decent, there is a big battery, a 3.5 mm audio jack and a fast fingerprint reader. Those who want similarly clean android but with a better processor may go for a pixel device."
1,Worst cam quality and  touch was not working properly waste of money.don't buy this mobile plz.even one star rating also waste for this mobile.
2,"Disappointed with nokia. Dont recommend.Sluggish processor performance that is visible in normal usage. I dont think it will support heavy games.Basic shortcuts missing, you have to dig deep to reach them.Fingerprint sensor refuses to respond many times and face lock works according to its wish.Poor camera interms of performance, no image stabilization. Images will be blurry if you dont keep your hand steady.Only satisfactory thing about this phone is battery life. But at this price it is not even close to redmi phones under 8k.Nokia has lost its quality and trust.I regret buying this phone."
5,"I love the Blue colour but Nokia G20 with Dark Blue is awesome and I bet everyone will love this colour. I got this product yesterday, will update about the same after using it for few days."
1,The Phone's performance is very bad. Don't buy it. I am regretting.
3,Better go to nokia 5.4 compare to G20.
3,"I always like phones without any adware and bloatware and Nokia phones are perfect for that.Nokia G20 also is good on that front.Battery life is very good.Camera performance is good.I like Fingerprint reader also on the side.Performance could be better as it gets sluggish sometimes, so better optimization is required.So in all its a good phone."
5,"48mp camera really good, macro 2mp super, great battery backup, value of money."
5,"Excellent phone and value for money. In day light ,camera is awesome. Battery life is very good. OS is neat and clean. Better buy in this price range."
4,"NOKIA G20 is a simple smartphone devoid of any sophisticated features ideal for the needs of a normal user. Its  build quality is good, has a decent battery back up, fairly large screen, and decent performance too. Ideal phone for Senior Citizens too who wishes to migrate from a feature phone to smartphone. The disappointing feature is the lack of screen switches to reverse or retract the pages if swiping fails.  The finger print sensor could have been placed at the back rather than at the edge. Design of the SIM tray needs enhancement. I would give it a 3.5 stars rating."
3,"I got this phone, as I did not want to buy a Chinese phone. The only options were Nokia, LG, Samsung.Using this phone for month now, and this is a below average phone.PROS:Camera: The picture quality is good at this price point, it has night mode. Photos are crisp and clear.Battery: It lasts for 1.5 to 2 days. However, I am not a gamer or heavy phone user.Screen: The adaptive brightness is not very responsive, however screen is fine.CONS:Pretty much everything else:Finger print sensor: Its on power button, this takes away the feature where you can scroll down and see notifications tray. Also the sensor keeps on reading the fingerprint when the phone is in pocket. This results in phone getting locked. You will have to enter passcode very frequently.Processor: This is very old and slow, it hangs very frequently. resulting in phone restarts.Responsiveness of phone: This might be related to processor, but the phone gets frozen too many times.Overall a very outdated and below average phone. Nokia need to ramp up a lot to compete with Chinease phones."
4,"I'm giving 1 star less for quality control issues on Nokia's part. I received a defective unit at first which had camera issues. The replacement process is a huge headache - Amazon first requests a technician to inspect your device who never turns up and makes excuses when he calls you at the end of the day, then you have to talk to customer care who offers replacement (which could have been done at the first place).Overall it's a decent phone; fairly good camera, battery easily lasts for 1.5 days with normal usage, and stock android which means 0 ads and bloatware. The only thing that needs work is quality check in manufacturing: Nokia shouldn't be letting out defective pieces at the first place, so that customers don't have to deal with the tedious replacement process."
4,"Stock android.. without annoying third party apps..neat..good pics, fast enough... connectivity for network is fast and good..better than most phones..after all mobile connectivity is the foremost requirement  for a mobile and NOKIA knows it better a big negative point IT HAS ARABIC LANGUAGE BY DEFAULT IN THE BOTTOM SEARCH OPTIONS..NO HINDU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT AS A DEFAULT LANGUAGE IN INDIA.."
5,This product is really worth it...loved it using this mobile

5,Very good product quality
4,Overall It's good but minus is no earphone jack ..When I am on the fm radio it says plz put earphone but this handset has no ear phone jack... So fm option is waste not useAnd BT connect sound too lowBattery life superb .... It's good value for money
4,Phone purchased for a friend.And  He is satisfied with phone quality.It is very small phone.
2,"I ordered for red color one,  but received the Pink color. It is to be noted that price for red is higher than that of pink.  Phone is an Ok kind of product, battery last for one day with limited usage. Signal reception is bit low. So it will work only  if your are having good network coverage."
3,"If backup improves it will be a very good product. Sound features are too good. Call quality, music player, all good but back need to improve. Only listening music 3 hours will work. Which is not a good thing."
1,i am unable to switch on the machine.perhaps battery is totally drain.In a new product how battery can found drain condition.So i wants seller should take back the product immediately..

1,Front speaker not available
1,"From day 1 it showed problems while talking.i thought it was network issue, But it's ear speaker was faulty. After i find out this ,return time line from Amazon expired.so i went to lava care .They're nice people they  checked and confirm speaker complaint. The said they can issue a ne mobile as replacement for one time .i agreed.after two days i got my new mobile.  BUT AFTER ONE DAY OF USAGE MY NEW MOBILE WENT TWO SHUT DOWN WHILE RINGING FOR AN INCOMING CALL. I TRIED TO SWITCH ON MANY TIMES IT GOES TO SHUT DOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IT SHOWED 2 DAYES BATTERY LEFT BEFORE THAT. I THINK THEY GAVE ME REFURBISHED MOBILE AS REPLACEMENT.VERY DISAPOINTED.SO MUCH FOR BUYING INDIAN GOODS"
1,"I got a worst phone piece, it has voice and signal issue from the day one, literally a useless phone. Wish i could give negative stars. Its a dummy phone. Worst seller Appario Retail, their customer service doesn't exist.Even amazon customer service couldn't do anything other than asking me to search for authorized service centers in my city and get it fixed. Hopeful purchase. Just stay away from Lava"
1,Sound quality of this phone is very badWhen ask for return Amazon says this product isn't eligible for return.
5,Very nice product..
1,It‚Äôs not working properly as I am not able to find any network in it and I have already requested for return this item but no one has came to pickup he product yet. Kindly look into this matter.
1,"Iam from Chennai , don‚Äôt buy this mobile , outlook wise good but 1month after not working SIM card signal .. kindly buy branded mobile most important don‚Äôt purchase  online"
1,"Very low quality........Not user-friendly system...... It looks good phone in images....... Battery life is very very poor, with fully charged it backups only 2 to 3 hours.......When on call sound leakage, it hears to surrounding people....... Please don't buy.....Better you go to SAMSUNG METRO 313 or SAMSUNG FM PLUS."
1,Over all the mobile is good battery works fine display was good keys are soft but the problem is that the upper button of the is not working after few days. Now that button do not work properly so i request to you kindly improve the quality of phone.
4,"Nice product regards to quality, cost and appearance. Delivery is also very fast."
1,"Stop making such products, where the battery backup is not there on phone, it like u have a nice road, but u can't ride vehicle 20kmph , battery maximum long lost for 2 hours per day, how much ever you do charging maximum 2 hours battery backup which is waste of money for a basic phone üì±"
2,Looks wise a stunning phone but call quality very poor and muffed.Returned it.Indian manufacturers need to produce quality products at least in basic phone segment to combat Chinese dominance.
2,Sound quality is not better while calling.. Voice is not clear while calling..Speaker problem
2,the battery life is good as well as the display but during calls can‚Äôt hear the voice properly i have to struggle as i am using it for work purposes i struggle a lot to listen the other person and that‚Äôs really bad because these phones are used for calling only mainly so please work on that because many phones are available at this price point i am disappointed
2,Buy phone for mother but voice not clear...

3,Sound quality is bad of the ear speaker which is used during call. Although Back speaker is good. Not so good for call. Good for FM. Better to buy any Samsung basic phone if purpose is making calls.
5,This product is awesome good looking with good features comfortable to use well battery backup good sound quality and many more But this product does not support internet the company can include internet features in this product.
2,Advantages1)Screen is big compared to other phones2) price is ok okDisadvantages1) charging socket is too tight2) charging problem3)buttons are not soft
3,Worth of 1200Can buy if looking for simple keypad mobile
5,"Nice product, worth of money"

5,Very nice phone and within budget.
1,"Even though the battery is full, the mobile turns off every 2-3 min while on call. Charging drains off quickly max 4 hours for 1 full charge. Worst product, couldn't even return now. Don't Buy."

1,Backwash phone no good phone cheap pro. Mediatek 720 screen TFT and battery charger  slow 15 watt only like 10000 phone ..nothing good..samsung very poor phone ..don't buy in 20000 ...TFT like 5000 phone display
5,Good 5G phone
5,"Bought it on the first day of launch. Delivered the next day. Very fast delivery by Amazon. Have been using it for last two days.Pros1. Phone has glass at the back which gives it a premium look. Feels stylish to carry it along.2. As usual, Samsung screen is smooth. Good picture clarity.3. Adaptive brightness 8s one of the best I've come across till date.4. Phone is very light.5. Camera quality is also very good. Front camera is also decent.6. Battery life is more than 24hrs for regular browsing over 24*7 wifi connection.7. Fingerprint sensor on right side is handy.Cons1. Charger is only 15 Watt. 25/30 Watt would have been better.2. Nothing else as of now.I feel good holding and using this Phone. If there is any chance then I'll update the review."
1,"Speakers are very very weak, produce very low sound, you will need headphone or speakers to listen music, I purchased it on first day and now they are just offering replacement which will not solve the purpose as every samsung M32 5G phone has this problem so I would recommend others to not waste their hard earned money in this phone as cost is too high compared to quality"
1,"Phone look is nice,Battery drain 65% after normal use 4 hours and 15 min.Camera is not as 48 mp if I compare my vivo phone 13 Mp is better than thisIf I talk about all over performance so phone is only good looking else nothing is in this device is goodPlz don't waste your money"
1,"I sold the phone sameday somehow on olx in 4k loss. Amazon doesn‚Äôt provide return.Phone is a joke.Plain M32 had full hd screen and now with 5G price has gone up by 6k and display is surprisingly half hd(HD+) . This is plain loot.Plastic is cheap.Camera is worst than any 10k phnSlow processorEven screen lags in scrolling, such bad refresh ratePathetic Processor and ramOverall its from 2012 times where HD+ was a thing. This phone is 9 yrs late.Never buy samsung in this segment."
3,They really need to work like motorola
1,Dislike- camera
4,"Received what I ordered.Received on time which is good, Thanks Amazon Team.Good Quality mobile from Samsung.Cheapest 5g ever with 12 band support.Purchased for my wife she is happy with phone.This worth and value for money üí∞ I would say.Sky Blue üîµ color looks premium!"
1,"After using one month I am writing this review,1. Galaxy M30s is better when compared to M32 5G, M30s has good battery capacity and camera quality,2. The camera quality is poor and the pixels.3. In this phone we can expect only 5G option that too we have to check after upgrading the sim.4. Regarding softwares I will post after updating the new software installation from Samsung,"
2,Over heat is produced while charging and when wattsapp messages receive and downloading. Spoke to customer care executive but they are not ready to take return
5,"Smooth touch, future ready with 5g, sleek design, expandable memory option upto 1 tb.First impression of the phone is good,when used phone continuously for over 2 hrs, videos and downloads and battery went from 50% to 25%, so i expect it to run for a day with full charge. Fast charge is also excellent, but not like other fast charges available in market. Its 1 min for 1% approxThere has been a issue with the M series of phones with UI not responding and system hangs, but this processor on m32 seems to be strong and they have I reckon resolved the issue (recommended not to use Samsung in build apps much as they consume lot of data and there is unnecessary lots of cashed data stored).Camera is OK, but they have lot of features like macro cam for close up night mode and have snap chat filters pre-added on camera which makes it fun and handy.Overall a perfect buy at this price range."
4,"Cons:1. Charger Adapter is only 15W Fast Charging unit. It takes  nearly 2 hours to get fully charged2. Charger wire length is less than 2 feet (comparatively less to the normal length of Charger wire )3. Fully charged phone will stand only 1 day if we use the phone at full level (use internet + calls ) through out the day.Pros:1. We can use secure folder option for securing confidential info/apps and data when we hand over the phone to some body either using finger print or pin or a pattern which is different from phone pattern.2. I got phone with RAM of 6 GB and installed several apps and used , phone doesn't show any slow down in speed.3. Finger print sensor at side switch on/off button seems to be attractive."
1,"Good phone till now except the finger print button location which accidentally pressed always when we are holding the phoneUpdate: reducing a starFacing glitches, not able to hear when I call to some body at first, if I keep try 2nd or 3rd time, then only I can hear.If it connect first then voice is not clear. Never faced any of these in my earlier realme phCharging time taking hell lot of time.Update: pls don't this phone, it's speaker is not clear, when I call its giving some disturbance not able hear the voice clearly"
1,"It's a worst mobile phone ever, Samsung proof that they are loos their credibility in India. This phone can not be worth more than  8k to 10 k. Camera is very poor, You can only use single Sim if you are using Micro SD card, Display is very poor , plz don't buy this phone. I think Samsung is going footprint of NOKIA ."
1,"The quality of camera, screen and performance or not at all good.camera quality is very very poor not even capturing photo like a phone of cost 3k. And the return policy of amazon was worst. Not a proper response by the executives of amazon. They are not accepting the return of this product, don't know the reason behind this. Dont  Why they are enecouranging sale of this product,  when they are getting similar problem form multiple customers.  Belief on amazon have worsening day by day.. literally disopinted with the amazon."
2,I personally  felt  display and front cam  ok ok but atleast rear cam for 23k 48mp its not good quality also. I am preferred to buy Samsung  but not this model
5,Video Player is loading.
3,"I have multiple feedback or this model. Overall I can give is 3 star only.Battery life is GoodDesign and look is goodBut there are many cons:Display looks very much shrinkedCamera specially in night mode is very very badFinger print reader most of the times does not take it. Tried many many times adding fingers and changing it, but reader quality is very badCharging cable received in the box is very small. Power adapter is of poor quality.Loud speaker is not at all loudOverall not very happy being a Samsung customer and Samsung product."
1,"Battery of Mobile device is what energy is to a living being. M32 5g has a very poor battery. Had bought this branded device with much expectations but this device's poor battery performance has let me down. Above all, replacement request was also not honoured by Amazon."
2,I have brought this phone during the first day of launch. I was expecting something better could be involved in this mobile but literally waste. Phone is getting heating issues while we speak any calls for appx 10 to 15 mins. I have started seeing hand pain issues after using this phone within a week. Its feels very heavy while using it. Its better to look for some other less weights phone to work.
4,"Gorgeous Blue glass body. Quick charge. Good screen, but not Crystal Clear. Samsung Apps are Confusing. Little heavier. Battery holding not that longer for the given capacity."
1,"Samsung M32 5G is a rubbish mobile from Samsung and more than that Amazon has a return and replace policy.  No return even if there is a problem with the product.  Remove Friends Samsung and Amazon from your life.  Both are waste of money and waste of time.  Amazon does not replace even after giving a bad mobile.  If there is such a policy, who will buy the product online?"
1,Box seal damage.Everyone please be aware
5,Perfect as per the specifications given in this price.
1,Vestage of money produt display not good

5,Binod.
4,"We haven't seen the ‚ÄòPrime' branding on a Redmi smartphone in a really long time, but now Xiaomi has brought it back with the Redmi 9 Prime. Xiaomi explains that this model has been launched because its Redmi Note 9 series has become more expensive due to the GST hike and Rupee-Dollar fluctuations. The Redmi 9 Prime is priced below the Redmi Note 9 series and starts just below the Rs. 10,000 price point. Has Xiaomi gone overboard with cost-cutting, or does the Redmi 9 Prime offer you good value for money? I review the new Redmi 9 Prime to find out.At the beginning of our Redmi 9 Prime review, we stated that the smartphone is a prime contender for the best smartphone under Rs 10,000 currently in India. Redmi 9 Prime is a budget all-rounder that ticks most boxes right with its value-for-money performance package.The camera unit may not be the best but it gets the job done. The lack of night mode is a bummer though. You can pick Xiaomi‚Äôs own Redmi Note 9 (review) that gets points for its big battery, decent display and an above-average performance unitI bought it for youtube review but it changed me"
1,This phone is unnecessary creating black market ...By launching the phn in flash sale 90% phone are booked by bookies and sell in open market for Rs1000-2000 extra cost. I stopped using Redmi everyone should also do so.
5,nice camera
4,Good but camera quality not good
3,Only name change by mi . Not as expected
1,"At A price Point of 12000 this is definitely not a best phone because In Box Only 10W Normal charger is available2- At 12000 , How a 13 MP CAMERA IS worth?Narzo Is a better deal than this at 12000rs"
5,"Hi Guys  I write this review to encourage you to buy this Powerful Processor Smartphone with easily enough 5020Mah Battery with Full HD Plus Display, proves that it is one and only Real Value of Money Budget Smartphone of Covid19 infected year 2020. Must buy it before MI increases its price from Rs 9999 to Rs 10999.However, I'll recommend everyone to buy a 4GB Ram 64GB Variant as one has to pay Rs 2000 more for increasing only 64GB Storage to 128GB Storge and for Rs 11999 we have available Realme Nazro 10 with more Powerful Quad Camera along with 18W Fast Charger for which one has to Spnd more Rs 600 more to purchase separately for RedMi Prime Customer! Same difference also in Rear Camera also as Realme provides 16MP while RedMi 9 Prime only 8MP! It must be mentioned here that Camera Quality of RedMi 9 Prime is worth of Money if you buy 64GB Variant!In short, I'll recommend to everyone to buy this Smartphone before it's price hike as after increasing GST to 18% it has become just a Dream to buy a Smartphone with Powerful Battery back up, Powwrful Processor HelioP80, Quad Camera and Full HD Display!Thanks for reading my review!"
5,Only camera quality is poor.  Other all are good.
2,"Pros.* Perfect P2i Protection*  Low Rate* Good build quality for this price* Android 10* MIUI 11 { waiting for miui 12 }Cons.* camera is below average* Average display quality* No earphones in the box* OVER HEATING* Takes very long time to charge battery.* Poor audio qualityIf your are planning to buy for students { Online class }, its worthless."
4,good but not as advertised.camera is just ok
5,"I have never seen this type of mobile under this price. Because so many specifications in addition with FHD+ IPS DISPLAY.Coming to gaming (#PUBG) awesome yaar playing HD with High graphics smoothly (@G80 powerful gaming Processor). Coming to battery it takes 1:30 min approximately from 30% to 100%.paking also super received two days earlier. U know one thing u can't find another mobile under 10k with this type of specifications (hoping in the future also).If my review helps you to clarify what type of smartphone  you are looking for that makes me very happy.Overall :Best budget phone (@pisa vassol)Long lasting battery, Super for gaming, camera also good not bad, fast charging, fast unlocking fingerprint sensor, type-C. Overall I loved it, Thank you Amazon."
5,"By good luck, I was able to get this phone in the third flash sale. Earlier i had participated in two flash sale but the phone was going out of stock in a few seconds. I am very happy with this phone. it is performing very well. no other company are providing great specifiation in this price segment as this phone has. this phone has media tek helio G 80 processor, full hd plus display, quad camera setup along with 13 mp primary camera and 8 mp selfie camera. phone comes with 5020 mah battery with 18 watt type c fast charging support.however in box you will get 10 watt charger but you can buy quick charge 3.0 (18watt) charger on mi store in only 500rs.  but there is one issue for those customer who are interested to buy this phone is that, black marketing is going on. offline seller buy this phone by the help of their group network on telegram and whatsapp by giving some money to console and sell it by overprice. thus the customer who truly need this phone are returning disappointed. i think COD option should be disable to stop black marketing."
5,"Good mobile, Quality is good. Colour of mobile awesome, budget price, Battery Backup is good, Camera Average."
5,Outstanding mobile... In 10000....4gB 64 gB varriant....
1,"Have tried in 3 flash sales, right from 10 minutes before to 1 hour after the flash sale went live. Stock is 100 Percent claimed already when sale starts, there is no option given even for a fraction of second to add to cart.It is a fake sale just to increase its brand image. Disappointed. Disgusting. Ratings are only 52 after 3 flash sales, that itself tells the story.If the stock went out just after it started and ratings are only 52, what sale is it making, keeping 10 units for each flash sale?There is no news on how many sales are made in each flash sale, that speaks for itself."
4,Money worthy deal . Awesome
1,I Quite Disappointed with it because1- In Box Only 10W Charger is provided2- Only 13 MP CAMERA IS AVAILABLE AT 12000WHERE AS IN NARZO10 48MP MAIN CAMERA IS AVAILABLE AT 12000I suggest to only 10000Rs vaireny
1,This product is very very very bad quality.Made in china but not india
4,"During normal usage this phone gets heat up  upto 40 degree CelsiusAnd during charging it's charger heats very highAnd this phone's battery  last long only for 22 hours if we use for normal task only.Is that heating issue is common or it's a defective piece ?Update:- I got replacement of redmi 9 prime on 21 sep 2020 and this time product is perfectIt gives great backup of 1day 5 hours with heavy usage (i.e online classes, YouTube, unacademy etc)Phone doesn't heat but still charger heats"
4,"The best phone to buy under 10K Category, Back Panel is of Plastic Material, Glass or Metal would be very nice, battery drains a little fast, Sound Ok, Display Ok, Camera performance is also good, images are a little over-processed but looks good, No headphone inside the box Transparent back cover is present inside the box."

1,"Really Disappointed by Amazon sent me""Made¬†In¬†China"" product!No ""Made¬†in India by Redmi"" ? (the reason, I selected Redmi. but disappointed)Giving '1star' because,no '0 star' option is there!!!![1. Giving 1star to 'made¬†in¬†china'.2. Not reviewing for 'Quality & all']"
2,Look wise good. Design also good. Ordered on prime days sale got product on almost 15 days later. Games: - U can't play pubg on high settings. Yes daily task easily do.System os: miui have too much ads.Charging: its take almost 3+ hour to full charge could be give atleast 18w charger in the box.Display : is good fhd norch.Storage type: emmc so read and write speed slow..I don't recommend ..
1,I want to purchase this phone but in flash sale i dont able to puchase so i purchase other phone from flipkart.
4,"I am writing this review after+ 20 days of purchase....i am satisfied with the quality of 9prime its is superb in case of gaming display and camera also..i think redmi should provide 18W charge in box. it's good option for everyone but there one more option NARZO 20 in 10500 /- it's also a great deal as campared to ,9 prime 6000 mah battery , 48mp cam. And 18W charge in box....."
5,Nice phone
4,"No doubt....Redmi 9 Prime is the most budget friendly handset...you get decent quality specs, type-c port and a 1080p display just for 10k !! Everything's good....no need to talk about every sepc one by one separately. Except the only downside being camera...but that is acceptable....you cant get high quality sensors for 10k. Not much bloatwares...no banned apps...no adds...almost clean ui experience...no heating issue.For me, It beats any of its competitors like Narzo 10, 10a, C3 and other similars.  Dont waste money on  downgrade phones like Redmi 9, 9a etc. Now if you compare it with recently launched narzo 20a in this price, yes narzo has better battery but remember it doesnt have FHD display, so you wont get quality video and graphics intense gaming experience and there is not very huge difference between 12mp and 48mp camera, So make choice between better battery or better multimedia.The only reason I have given one star less is because of the price. The price of 64gb variant is abolutely amazing but not for 128gb one and I am reviewing for latter. For 128gb variant, either there should have been more 2gb of ram with a fast charger or the price should have been 11k. Xiomi is charging extra 2k just for extra 64gb storage, totally dishonest.Tip : Using a lite UI like Evie launcher and lite keyboard can help free some amount of ram and extend battery backup.Thank You"
1,Redmi 9 Prime is a Scam I'll try all sales but I don't buy it just 12 o'clock this sale was all claimed no option for buy or add to cart it's a Scam
4,So I was looking for a budget smartphone and redmi 9 prime was the best option among other phones available at the same price range.
1,Very bad quality battery and from 10% too 100% charging take more than 3 hrs. And battery backup very bad üëéüëéüëéüëé
5,"The product is nice with great battery ,and the mostly insane killer looks.Camera is not as bad as everyone is sayingMeanwhile u can't expect more in this price rangeOverall best package in this price segment"
1,Don't go for this if you are looking for good camera. Photos of this Mobile aren't hoto the mark. So I would not recommend to buy this mobile.
5,Excellent phone i love it in this price
2,There is no made in india label on the phone . I think I get old storage. The box and phone is labelld with made in China label. How it is happened??The phone details shows the manufacturer is in Andrapradesh. But i got the phone manufactured in china..? Is it legal?? Any problem with using with this phone???
4,"Five stars for Full hd display, battery backup,fast chargerTwo stars for user interface, yellow page app with call application is huge privacy concerncan't forcestop annoying inbuilt waste app, forced MI apps over other apps"
5,Best in Class
1,"Open cheating by Realme.C11(2021) is rebranded as Narzo 50i.Every thing is same except back cover design.We can see model name as 'C11 2021' in 'about phone' setting of Narzo 50i.Worst part is we can get 'C11 2021' at Rs.900/- less than 'Narzo 50i'.Didn't expect this from Realme.Specifications on Amazon show it is a usb c-type cable, but cable is micro-usb."
1,I really disappointed with this product
1,not a good phone. Poor performance . Even it says Realme C11 at some place. Seems faulty phone
4,"I think I am the first buyer and this is first review of this product. üòÑI got it for 6299 Rs in big billion sale.For the price, it's display is bright and good quality. It has type C port which is exciting.(i found out later that it's not type c) 5000 mah battery. 18 W charging. Processor is good for mid graphics games like hill climb racing and few shooting games. It can play pubg but you won't enjoy it much. It can handle day to day apps like Whatsapp, facebook, instagram, chrome, youtube without any lag or heating. Camera is average but for this price it's good. Clickable pictures.It has realme ui which is features loaded. Best UI. I have 3 realme phones and updates are never delayed. Hence company really backup product after sales.Don't expect performance of a 10k or 15k phone. Compare it with realme C11 or redmi9a.Product description mentioned type C charger. That's really misleading. Really bad Marketing.1 star deducted.And yes Mint green is best color. ‚úåÔ∏è"
5,My phone not real which my order is realme narzo 50I but I check in this phone setting about phone realme c11
3,"Even in Settings ---> About phone ---> Device name,  it was mentioned as ""realme c11 2021"" . Ughhh... Atleast you guys should have changed that...."
1,"This was cheated by realme. its not norzao 50i, it is resale of Realme c11. May be they forgot to change the nameüòÄ. I never expected this kind of UI and OS from realme mobiles. Setting options and display and app management is worst. With this phone you can't call any customer care bcuz u can't select the given IVR options."
3,Totally disappointed with Realme.Micro usb charging.Overall phone is okkBut either you can buy realme C11 2021 in less price
1,Video Player is loading.
1,has basic camera.. no use at all.has 5000 mAh battery and no fast charging . so u will have to keep it charged. so its more like basic power bank which will take more time to charge.charging port micro USB not even type Ctouch is very bad. phone in pocket sensors does work. will have to disable it. So completely useless.speaker is mono but quality is below average or very bad.even calling page will take time to go from 1 page to another.Add some money to ur budget and go for better phone. This is worth less phone.expect looks nothing is good in this phone.My suggestion:: do not go for this phone
5,Value for money but fingers print sensor is missing in this model. No back cover in the box as mentioned in spec's.
1,By look phone is nice. Back cover is not provided as mentioned. Camera quality is very low. Most importantly as phone name is showing realme C11 instead of narzo 50i. Amazon or seller should spet up and clear the things as it is confusing the customers. I don't know this phone is real Or someone cheat me.
2,AGAIN NO CASE IN REPLACED PHONE AS ADVERTISED IN THE AMAZON SITE. PLEASE CLARIFY WHEN DO WE GET THE CASE. ALSO THE PHONE MAY BE DEFECTIVE BECAUSE THE SIM TRAY IS NOT OPENING. WHY SO CARELESS WHEN SENDING PHONES TO THE CUSTOMER THAT AFTER FIRST COMPLAINT / REPLACEMENT. GET BACK TO US IMMEDIATELY WITH CLARIFICATION OR SUGGEST ALTERNATIVE.
5,All over good to use but they says the box include cover type c cable but this phone box coming with micro usb and don't have a cover and back plastic body poor i think..
1,"Waste of money  , wifi not working properly..my other 2 phones showing full signal strength but this phone showing only 1 signal strength and not able use wifi properly. Getting disconnectedNo option to return!! Utterly disappointed."
1,Such a trash from Realme.....üëéüëéüëéOn every aspect it is a trap....Dont go for this fone
1,"Wrost mobile, Better guys you buy redmi 9, better than this realme"
1,No C type connector as mentioned in description. Poor quality Camera. Screen guard and Back Cover missing from what's mentioned
4,"When we see the system name it will shown as realmec11 2021,but when we updated the software the name and function must changed into narzo 50i,no one notice that. This is a good budget phone and i am purchased at a rate of 6700 from amazon. Delivery is too fast and  5star rating for Amazon delivery partner."
5,Realme narzo 50iVery nice phoneBattery performance isGood
2,There is no back cover and screen protector as mention in detail.+The Phone is just rebranding of C11 at higher price+It doesn't have type C cable+My Exchange mode is rejected by courier
3,Heating problems are there in the mobile. 3.5 rating.
1,"Display scratches on my mobile, am not satisfied in this product, very worst product"

4,"Cons are no fingerprint sensor, apart from that this phone is good, has a 4gb ram and an 64gb storage. Works smoothly."
1,"Mobile Phone is getting overheated while the net is on, battery backup is also very poor"
1,I wanted to replace from the very first day of receiving the mobile due to minor display flickering problem but Amazon didn't give replacement option at all till the last date of replacement .I am forced to use as it is now.Very much disappointed ....!
1,no finger print sencer this rangeCamera quality low average

3,Phone lags quite a lotBattery is very niceCamera not goodLooks fabulous from behind.
1,Don't buy this phone. It gets hang after one week of use. Also battery getting heating very much. After one week you cannot replace this phone. Buy some other trusted brand phone.
1,Received damaged product. really disappointed.
1,Backwash phone no good phone cheap pro. Mediatek 720 screen TFT and battery charger  slow 15 watt only like 10000 phone ..nothing good..samsung very poor phone ..don't buy in 20000 ...TFT like 5000 phone display
5,Good 5G phone
5,"Bought it on the first day of launch. Delivered the next day. Very fast delivery by Amazon. Have been using it for last two days.Pros1. Phone has glass at the back which gives it a premium look. Feels stylish to carry it along.2. As usual, Samsung screen is smooth. Good picture clarity.3. Adaptive brightness 8s one of the best I've come across till date.4. Phone is very light.5. Camera quality is also very good. Front camera is also decent.6. Battery life is more than 24hrs for regular browsing over 24*7 wifi connection.7. Fingerprint sensor on right side is handy.Cons1. Charger is only 15 Watt. 25/30 Watt would have been better.2. Nothing else as of now.I feel good holding and using this Phone. If there is any chance then I'll update the review."
1,"Speakers are very very weak, produce very low sound, you will need headphone or speakers to listen music, I purchased it on first day and now they are just offering replacement which will not solve the purpose as every samsung M32 5G phone has this problem so I would recommend others to not waste their hard earned money in this phone as cost is too high compared to quality"
1,"Phone look is nice,Battery drain 65% after normal use 4 hours and 15 min.Camera is not as 48 mp if I compare my vivo phone 13 Mp is better than thisIf I talk about all over performance so phone is only good looking else nothing is in this device is goodPlz don't waste your money"
1,"I sold the phone sameday somehow on olx in 4k loss. Amazon doesn‚Äôt provide return.Phone is a joke.Plain M32 had full hd screen and now with 5G price has gone up by 6k and display is surprisingly half hd(HD+) . This is plain loot.Plastic is cheap.Camera is worst than any 10k phnSlow processorEven screen lags in scrolling, such bad refresh ratePathetic Processor and ramOverall its from 2012 times where HD+ was a thing. This phone is 9 yrs late.Never buy samsung in this segment."
3,They really need to work like motorola
1,Dislike- camera
4,"Received what I ordered.Received on time which is good, Thanks Amazon Team.Good Quality mobile from Samsung.Cheapest 5g ever with 12 band support.Purchased for my wife she is happy with phone.This worth and value for money üí∞ I would say.Sky Blue üîµ color looks premium!"
1,"After using one month I am writing this review,1. Galaxy M30s is better when compared to M32 5G, M30s has good battery capacity and camera quality,2. The camera quality is poor and the pixels.3. In this phone we can expect only 5G option that too we have to check after upgrading the sim.4. Regarding softwares I will post after updating the new software installation from Samsung,"
2,Over heat is produced while charging and when wattsapp messages receive and downloading. Spoke to customer care executive but they are not ready to take return
5,"Smooth touch, future ready with 5g, sleek design, expandable memory option upto 1 tb.First impression of the phone is good,when used phone continuously for over 2 hrs, videos and downloads and battery went from 50% to 25%, so i expect it to run for a day with full charge. Fast charge is also excellent, but not like other fast charges available in market. Its 1 min for 1% approxThere has been a issue with the M series of phones with UI not responding and system hangs, but this processor on m32 seems to be strong and they have I reckon resolved the issue (recommended not to use Samsung in build apps much as they consume lot of data and there is unnecessary lots of cashed data stored).Camera is OK, but they have lot of features like macro cam for close up night mode and have snap chat filters pre-added on camera which makes it fun and handy.Overall a perfect buy at this price range."
4,"Cons:1. Charger Adapter is only 15W Fast Charging unit. It takes  nearly 2 hours to get fully charged2. Charger wire length is less than 2 feet (comparatively less to the normal length of Charger wire )3. Fully charged phone will stand only 1 day if we use the phone at full level (use internet + calls ) through out the day.Pros:1. We can use secure folder option for securing confidential info/apps and data when we hand over the phone to some body either using finger print or pin or a pattern which is different from phone pattern.2. I got phone with RAM of 6 GB and installed several apps and used , phone doesn't show any slow down in speed.3. Finger print sensor at side switch on/off button seems to be attractive."
1,"Good phone till now except the finger print button location which accidentally pressed always when we are holding the phoneUpdate: reducing a starFacing glitches, not able to hear when I call to some body at first, if I keep try 2nd or 3rd time, then only I can hear.If it connect first then voice is not clear. Never faced any of these in my earlier realme phCharging time taking hell lot of time.Update: pls don't this phone, it's speaker is not clear, when I call its giving some disturbance not able hear the voice clearly"
1,"It's a worst mobile phone ever, Samsung proof that they are loos their credibility in India. This phone can not be worth more than  8k to 10 k. Camera is very poor, You can only use single Sim if you are using Micro SD card, Display is very poor , plz don't buy this phone. I think Samsung is going footprint of NOKIA ."
1,"The quality of camera, screen and performance or not at all good.camera quality is very very poor not even capturing photo like a phone of cost 3k. And the return policy of amazon was worst. Not a proper response by the executives of amazon. They are not accepting the return of this product, don't know the reason behind this. Dont  Why they are enecouranging sale of this product,  when they are getting similar problem form multiple customers.  Belief on amazon have worsening day by day.. literally disopinted with the amazon."
2,I personally  felt  display and front cam  ok ok but atleast rear cam for 23k 48mp its not good quality also. I am preferred to buy Samsung  but not this model
5,Video Player is loading.
3,"I have multiple feedback or this model. Overall I can give is 3 star only.Battery life is GoodDesign and look is goodBut there are many cons:Display looks very much shrinkedCamera specially in night mode is very very badFinger print reader most of the times does not take it. Tried many many times adding fingers and changing it, but reader quality is very badCharging cable received in the box is very small. Power adapter is of poor quality.Loud speaker is not at all loudOverall not very happy being a Samsung customer and Samsung product."
1,"Battery of Mobile device is what energy is to a living being. M32 5g has a very poor battery. Had bought this branded device with much expectations but this device's poor battery performance has let me down. Above all, replacement request was also not honoured by Amazon."
2,I have brought this phone during the first day of launch. I was expecting something better could be involved in this mobile but literally waste. Phone is getting heating issues while we speak any calls for appx 10 to 15 mins. I have started seeing hand pain issues after using this phone within a week. Its feels very heavy while using it. Its better to look for some other less weights phone to work.
4,"Gorgeous Blue glass body. Quick charge. Good screen, but not Crystal Clear. Samsung Apps are Confusing. Little heavier. Battery holding not that longer for the given capacity."
1,"Samsung M32 5G is a rubbish mobile from Samsung and more than that Amazon has a return and replace policy.  No return even if there is a problem with the product.  Remove Friends Samsung and Amazon from your life.  Both are waste of money and waste of time.  Amazon does not replace even after giving a bad mobile.  If there is such a policy, who will buy the product online?"
1,Box seal damage.Everyone please be aware
5,Perfect as per the specifications given in this price.
1,Vestage of money produt display not good
1,"It is a bundle of problems;1. Camera, so called 108 MP is poorer than my last 12 MP of Moto G6 plus.2. Macro camera is the worst one. No use of this.3. Vibrations during incoming calls if it is in silent mode, you won't be able to feel whether it is vibrating. End of the day you will miss many calls.4. Bluetooth gets disconnected very often.5. I have bought this one to use its call recording feature, but it says 'your call is being recorded' even to other person also. What is the use of it, I don't know.I have used 3-4 phones in last 3 years but never found such worst quality phone.Plz don't buy Mi phones. They are cheaters..Their so called technical expert customer care people don't know anything, they ask me to clear the cache data and re-updation of already updated MiUi version."
4,Hey I'm tech content creator on YouTube name as a 'Madan Gaikwad'*Initial review*1) Camera Oversaturation issue.2) 120Hz display refresh rate not optimazased for some apps.3) No EIS currently on 4K 30fps4) Some Speed test on our YouTube channel so I'm observed ram management biggest issue on UI or CPU Throttling also.5) Battery performance avarage- 120 hz + 50% brightness + No gaming - 6hrs on screen time.6) Charging time impressive-65 mins.More videos on madan gaikwad YouTube channel.
4,"Excellent Phone with all it's features, excellent camera, excellent 120hz refresh rate, excellent sound, excellent battery, excellent performance of 750g processor. Don't go with them who are comparing it with other similar but different processor phones, sound is perfect, a small smart phone will not give you like 120w sound output so whatever it's giving is awesome. Super night mode camera. Only missing is Super Amoled display but it's ok. It is a compact phone with great camera and great performance.Though side finger print sensor misses sometime to open or turn off the screen, this is minor issue.Selfie Camera is not upto the mark, the selfie photots are flipped, it looks very odd.h Hope Mi will take care of this issue in next update."

1,I am using this phone from last 10 hours.... Battery not so good and camera also not so good.... Not so fast according to 120 hz display
1,"Camera quality is just a gimmick, display quality is average. Finger print sensor is not fast"
5,It's a superb product for the price point.Display is awesome. Really loved that 120hz display but the screen could have been brighter.Audio is loud enough.No stutter noticed during usage of display.Charging time is blazingly fast .Rear camera is good and the front camera was just a typical mi  front camera.
1,"With the hype of cheap 5g phone and 108MP camera and different modes for camera setting I made decision to take this phone on day 1 as this was supposed to be atleast as good as mi note 9 max pro. But the mobile has many issues. It's internet connectivity over wifi drops occasionally when switched apps. It's not able to process the video editing even with 750 processor my realme 3 pro was doing lot faster and better than this mobile.I'm writting this review in Gmail app as the connectivity of mobile over wifi is so bad its not opening Amazon app.Photos are good at full size zoom is having pixels even at day light.Photo modes are good with included long exposure options.Display isn't that great compare to my old realme 3 pro.Feels little bit heavy in hand as the back case is of glass.I regret buying it now have to wait for update to see if there is any improvement else have to sell it off or exchange it with as it's missing basic of phone i.e. stable internet connection where all apps in mobile now a days won't work without it.Verdict: if looking only 108MP and 5G features and thinking of buying this phone then dont go for it. Wait for another 3 months lots of 5G affordable phones to hit the market soon with improved processor and os and more supporting brands.Updated on 18-03-2021Apps are crashing unable to open the Amazon over click on item from chrome.Gmaps is not showing blue root lines at all,I'm thinking of exchanging üò§ even for 60-70% rate. My previous real me 3 pro still works lik a charm."
5,"Miss:(1) Stock Android unavailable(2) Camera not optimized(3) Slightly overpriced. Bought 8 GB + 128 GB variant for Rs 21999, however should have been priced at Rs 19,999."
1,"while talking over speaker phone, some of my friends they are getting their voice repeated in between for 2 to 3 sec , also while talking if any notification comes they don't get my voice for 1 to 2 sec.front camera quality while making video call over whatsapp is bad main camera images are over sharpening, sometimes bad dynamic range, human skin time is over whitesh or redishsometime call dialer and message app is really buggy, while Playing games if i recieved the sometimes it shows black screen, if i setup any other dialer instead of google then not able to increase or decrease volume of the call. rather than give us old miui dialer and message app those are great ones. gpay, paytm, bhim app, are not doing verification properly the message app , i tried lot of times then i have to install other message app to verify them.hdr10 , darkers areas goes more darker and not visible, why i have to press button if fingerprint is there , every time i have to press button, raise phone and double to wake screen is not working properly , its buggy sometimes work sometimes doesn'tAnd why amazon hold the reviews for 7 days after first sale?"

Audio speaker is vibrating the set. Feel in hand. Money loss. MI cheating India customer. I waste money. No more products purchase in MI. I am very upset. Please return money. My amount is hard work money
5,CAMERA QUALITY IS VERY GOOD you can make a vlock in this phone Android 10 in this phone i like 12 miui poco M2 is comparing this phone but this phone is flagship phone
1,Third class camera performance. Only 108 megapixel camera images is good. All other modes photos poor quality.
2,Battery drains very fast compared to other mobiles. Camera is good but very prone to get scratches easily.
1,"Think before you buy, they wont provide you return previlages, also no discount on icici debit card."
2,"MY VERY FIRST HONEST REVIEW:-I have been a man of HTC/Honor/Vivo so far. This is the very first time I have purchased Mi phone i.e. Mi 10i considering its 5G feature in a reasonable price-range. Honestly, this lacks in many things Vs as hyped. Specs on the paper look alluring but don't justify in reality, Quality is missing in everything. Quality is replaced with some alternate cheap gimmicks. Camera is 108MP which is the fist time ever in India as claimed by Mi but in reality it just another piece of crap - it doesn't give the actual/sharp detail or crisp output it is just like other cheap phones whose cameras make the buffalo look like Cow. Its Selfie Camera is worst than the old phones' VGA camera. Now lets talk about the other features: Display is sluggish not so responsive as it should be. 120hz RR is nowhere noticed or noticeable. sometimes we have to tap thrice on the icon. Unnecessary pre-loaded bundle-apps. It Weighs on bit bulky side. Audio is louder enough but not that sharp and crisp. Battery charges ultra-fast backup is also decent and justifies 4820mAh.The most important thing for me is - network connectivity in which, this phone really disappoints me in a big-way. My earlier VIVO Z1X used to have strong connectivity in the closed-door area whereas this phone has only 2-3 bars on the same place. My main reason to buy this phone was - to have strong connectivity and rapid response of screen and processor but it doesn't behave like 6GB RAM. It satisfies me ONLY in Fast Charging and Batter backup rest all are not up to the mark...Sorry Mi fans, this is what my sincere observation is from 4 days' usage. I wonder, If 4G connectivity is not so good then how come we expect 5G to be beneficial. The side-mount finger sensor behaves strangely. Sometime it is fast and sometime doesn't recognize.I do not know whether Mi can fix all this thru OTA update. If so, Mi can add one more customer in their family. Thanks!"
1,During launching time amazon didn't give full details of this phone.NFC sensor not available.
1,"Really disappointed. Gets hot even with general usage, battery getting drained, pathetic speaker, I wish there were some review before I purchased it. Regret my purchase. The only thing that is great is camera quality."
4,The phone was amazing except call recording issues... There is no automatic call recording option.although u record ur calls... There is no voice
1,"Not a good product. It's like any sub 15k mobile with 5g processor. I did not like it at all. One thing I cannot understand that why these stupid mobile companies are kept increasing the length of mobile unnecessarily. Considering the width, the length is way too long, useless and makes the phone unhandy. A phone screen must not be larger than 6 inch and length should not exceed 16:9 screen ratio. Idiot companies are just racing to show their screen larger on paper to compete with peers.Update: The phone screen damaged with a very-very mild impact while the company says it has gorilla glass protection. Now had to pay 9500 for screen only :( I cannot believe I had wasted 22k and now had to waste another 9500."
3,other then 5g you can take poco m2 pro.poco m2 pro is very better in that price.Rate of mi 10i is little high.Approx cost may be 16-17k.

3,"I bought this phone with a great hope that it might replace my current POCO f1, but it didn't.Talking about camera, where we spend greater amount of time on Selfies, the pictures are too distorted. I haven't used rear camera much, but I'll do that on weekend and share pictures.The OS is exactly the same as POCO F1, so no comments or concerns, as I find it satisfactory.The display is large and bright, battery provides enough amount of supply for 1.5 days with 2-3 hours of the media and 24 hours of constant internet connectivity.The phone has hybrid Sim slot and there's no 256 gb version for India, which makes it difficult to use for long term, if one like to take high-resolution videos.I would rate this phone 3.5 because of below avg front camera, no amoled display and storage limitations.Thanks!"
1,Mi 10i phone has many problem.Battery life is very poor.Mobile is heating up while charing.I had factory reset my mobile after that Google photo app not upload in my mobile.I want to return the mobile. AMAZON have returned or replacement policy but it is not effective.In FLIPKART is very easy to return or replace.So don't buy anything from Amazon.in.I am very disappointed from Amazon and also Mi 10i mobile.

4,"Pre purchase research: I've been using poco f1 with a custom ROM (evolution X) for the last 2¬Ω years and wanted to upgrade (tbh, mostly out of fomo) as I wanted a good camera on a smartphone (Poco F1 with gcam was decent but not very reliable)... I don't game a lot now and neither watch OTT content on phone (Used to but now I only use PC or laptop)The reason I chose Mi 10i over redmi note 10 Pro Max: As I don't watch a lot of OTT content on phone, amoled, although better than LCD in every way, doesn't really matter for me and Mi 10i has a good enough display (bright and accurate enough)... Mi 10i has a f/1.75 lens over the f/1.9 on max lens of max and 750G comes with a kryo 570 cores which is a generation upgrade to kryo 470 on 732G...Chose it over Poco X3 Pro cuz my main use case nowadays is only social media and camera, so 860 is an overkill and cameras on Mi 10i and RN 10 max are a step above X3 Pro..Summary is If you consume a lot of media on phone, go with note 10 max otherwise mi 10i has slightly better camera and faster. If you're a gamer, Hands down go with Poco X3 Pro...After 2 weeks of usage: It is exactly as I expected and didn't disappointBeforehand (valid for all Xiaomi phones): While setting up the device, uncheck everything you can and select the location as UK instead of India and you won't have the getapps store, which sends annoying notifications that, if you follow him, geekyranjit always complains about xD.Then enable developer options by clicking 7 times on miui version and change the animations to 0.5x..Now coming to the review:Things done right:1. The phone is crazy fast for day to day usage that it's a delight to use.. Miui with 120Hz just flies with 0.5x animations. I wouldn't say it's significantly better than Poco F1 with evo x but it's as good and that's not a bad thing at all...2. The camera is a significant upgrade over Poco F1.. the 108MP camera (9:1 pixel binned 12MP photos) with f/1.75 lens takes amazing photos in day light and very good in low light as well... The natural bokeh it produces is mindblowing. However it's not all good too. The selfie camera is above average as best. It's good enough but that's about it. Gcam significantly improves but again it's not very consistent and not exactly point and shoot kinda solution. Wide angle is not even significantly close to main camera. You're better off taking panoramas or photo spheres with gcam. Macro and depth just make up numbers... Haven't checked video recording due to lockdown. There are a tons of camera modes as well which I haven't checked, again due to lockdown but seem pretty cool and from what I've seen in YouTube works pretty well too.. Will update once I get to use those personally. HDR mode although excellent, processing is not instant and takes a second to process. Nothing to worry about at all and that's the reason for mentioning as well. Also the HDR settings reset after reopening the camera app. You need to change that in settings. One of many little miui annoyances.3. Battery life is excellent. Easily gets through a day even if you use a lot. Charges to more than 80% under an hour, even if you're using in between, which lasts a full day easily. It's a good balance between charging speed, battery health, battery life and weight. I've attached some accubattery stats4. Speakers and Display.. well not amoled but a very good LCD. Gets bright enough in daylight, gets dim enough with lights off... Sharp and color accurate... A very good display for daily usage but if it's your highest priority, there are better options that are not too far behind in other aspects as well (redmi note 10 Pro Max)... Speakers are very good. Produces excellent sound, loud enough and clear. Has a bit of punch in the low end too. You won't need an external speaker for regular usage..5. Build and design: first thing you'll notice is how big and heavy it is... Not a huge fan of it tbh. Not a comfortable single hand usage Device. Poco F1 is like the perfect size imo. Other than that, it looks gorgeous in the sunrise colour and comes with gorilla glass 5 on both sides (the reason for the heft) which is the best you could get at this price. Tbh I personally don't care about these. The in-box case is very good, protects the camera module (which otherwise wobbles quite a bit on flat surface) and the raised to protect the screen from falls as well... It does come with a plastic screen protector but I recommend getting a tempered glass for the best scratch resistance. The fingerprint reader is a but wobbly.. hope it won't be an issue..6. The basics: Xiaomi phones usually have excellent custom ROM support. Apart from that, Has all the sensors you need. Proximity sensor works fine. The call quality and signal reception, both with Jio and 5 ghz wifi is good. Fingerprint reader on power button is fast and I personally feel it's the best placement for fp reader. IR blaster is an add-on. Headphone jack is there, if you connect external mic or your high quality wired earphones.Now coming to the annoyances6. Miui:  a. Biggest problem with Miui that no one talks about is the Notification management. Ads and all can be disabled but this is something where you can't do much. It needs a huge overhaul. It's pretty crap especially considering how good android 10 and 11 notification management is.whatsapp reply option cuts into the screen. It gets worse with multiple notifications. Really annoying and Xiaomi needs to work on it.Update: Notification management is worse than I thought... If multiple WhatsApp notifications arrive while you're also typing a message, the phone locks. It is pretty weird. Also notification categories are almost non existent. You can't even have separate notifications for multiple Instagram profiles which is too basic.. On the contrary stock android has one of the best notification management and Miui customized it to be worst.  b. Memory management on 6gb Variant: while writing this review itself, I opened the camera app to check the modes for a couple of minutes (Vpn and tidal are running in background playing music through LDAC) and Amazon got booted out of memory. That's how bad it is xD. Luckily I copied it to the clipboard. I don't think 8gb Variant would be any better. 6gb should be more than enough for this particular use case. Never had such issues with evolution X. Games, yes but Amazon being booted out is unacceptable. Yes this is done to preserve battery life but the trade-off is too much.Update: apart from that one day, it hasn't been a problem. Do note that I don't game a lot. Personally haven't seen any issues with Truecaller or SMS organizer.  c. These two are the major annoyances but there are a few others too. LDAC bitrate must be set to 990kbps from developer options which again resets to adaptive bitrate evertime you disconnect and reconnect. If I'm enabling LDAC I already know the trade-off and I'm willing to take it. Why bother about altering it? HDR resets, as said above. Will update if I encounter any more.d. Ahh forgot the good old security app scanning every app that's downloaded, even from play store, which are already protected by play protect. Another privacy concern right there. Every brand does that but not as evidently as Xiaomi. At least there aren't any ads unlike the redmi phones with India region. Another plus for mi 10i over note 10 maxe. Autorotate is bad... Ik it's bad in almost all phones but in stock android (evolution X), when you turn it off and if it detects orientation, it gives you a tiny rotate icon on the bottom left corner and if you click on it, it changes the orientation... It's not just a handy feature but an essential one especially with a Broken autorotate. Idk why these OEMs remove features of stock android in the name of customisation..Conclusion: These annoyances are not much compared to what you're getting in terms of other aspects but these are what reduces the experience to a 4 star. That being said there can't be a phone with no compromises at this price and tbh, the ones on mi 10i are easier to live with. It gets most things right and most people will be happy with it. It looks good, feels good, fast, has excellent camera and doesn't skip on basic sensors like the Samsungs and motorolas at this."

4,Hey I'm tech content creator on YouTube name as a 'Madan Gaikwad'*Initial review*1) Camera Oversaturation issue.2) 120Hz display refresh rate not optimazased for some apps.3) No EIS currently on 4K 30fps4) Some Speed test on our YouTube channel so I'm observed ram management biggest issue on UI or CPU Throttling also.5) Battery performance avarage- 120 hz + 50% brightness + No gaming - 6hrs on screen time.6) Charging time impressive-65 mins.More videos on madan gaikwad YouTube channel.
4,"Excellent Phone with all it's features, excellent camera, excellent 120hz refresh rate, excellent sound, excellent battery, excellent performance of 750g processor. Don't go with them who are comparing it with other similar but different processor phones, sound is perfect, a small smart phone will not give you like 120w sound output so whatever it's giving is awesome. Super night mode camera. Only missing is Super Amoled display but it's ok. It is a compact phone with great camera and great performance.Though side finger print sensor misses sometime to open or turn off the screen, this is minor issue.Selfie Camera is not upto the mark, the selfie photots are flipped, it looks very odd.h Hope Mi will take care of this issue in next update."

1,I am using this phone from last 10 hours.... Battery not so good and camera also not so good.... Not so fast according to 120 hz display
1,"Camera quality is just a gimmick, display quality is average. Finger print sensor is not fast"
5,It's a superb product for the price point.Display is awesome. Really loved that 120hz display but the screen could have been brighter.Audio is loud enough.No stutter noticed during usage of display.Charging time is blazingly fast .Rear camera is good and the front camera was just a typical mi  front camera.
1,"With the hype of cheap 5g phone and 108MP camera and different modes for camera setting I made decision to take this phone on day 1 as this was supposed to be atleast as good as mi note 9 max pro. But the mobile has many issues. It's internet connectivity over wifi drops occasionally when switched apps. It's not able to process the video editing even with 750 processor my realme 3 pro was doing lot faster and better than this mobile.I'm writting this review in Gmail app as the connectivity of mobile over wifi is so bad its not opening Amazon app.Photos are good at full size zoom is having pixels even at day light.Photo modes are good with included long exposure options.Display isn't that great compare to my old realme 3 pro.Feels little bit heavy in hand as the back case is of glass.I regret buying it now have to wait for update to see if there is any improvement else have to sell it off or exchange it with as it's missing basic of phone i.e. stable internet connection where all apps in mobile now a days won't work without it.Verdict: if looking only 108MP and 5G features and thinking of buying this phone then dont go for it. Wait for another 3 months lots of 5G affordable phones to hit the market soon with improved processor and os and more supporting brands.Updated on 18-03-2021Apps are crashing unable to open the Amazon over click on item from chrome.Gmaps is not showing blue root lines at all,I'm thinking of exchanging üò§ even for 60-70% rate. My previous real me 3 pro still works lik a charm."

1,"while talking over speaker phone, some of my friends they are getting their voice repeated in between for 2 to 3 sec , also while talking if any notification comes they don't get my voice for 1 to 2 sec.front camera quality while making video call over whatsapp is bad main camera images are over sharpening, sometimes bad dynamic range, human skin time is over whitesh or redishsometime call dialer and message app is really buggy, while Playing games if i recieved the sometimes it shows black screen, if i setup any other dialer instead of google then not able to increase or decrease volume of the call. rather than give us old miui dialer and message app those are great ones. gpay, paytm, bhim app, are not doing verification properly the message app , i tried lot of times then i have to install other message app to verify them.hdr10 , darkers areas goes more darker and not visible, why i have to press button if fingerprint is there , every time i have to press button, raise phone and double to wake screen is not working properly , its buggy sometimes work sometimes doesn'tAnd why amazon hold the reviews for 7 days after first sale?"

2,Battery drains very fast compared to other mobiles. Camera is good but very prone to get scratches easily.

2,"MY VERY FIRST HONEST REVIEW:-I have been a man of HTC/Honor/Vivo so far. This is the very first time I have purchased Mi phone i.e. Mi 10i considering its 5G feature in a reasonable price-range. Honestly, this lacks in many things Vs as hyped. Specs on the paper look alluring but don't justify in reality, Quality is missing in everything. Quality is replaced with some alternate cheap gimmicks. Camera is 108MP which is the fist time ever in India as claimed by Mi but in reality it just another piece of crap - it doesn't give the actual/sharp detail or crisp output it is just like other cheap phones whose cameras make the buffalo look like Cow. Its Selfie Camera is worst than the old phones' VGA camera. Now lets talk about the other features: Display is sluggish not so responsive as it should be. 120hz RR is nowhere noticed or noticeable. sometimes we have to tap thrice on the icon. Unnecessary pre-loaded bundle-apps. It Weighs on bit bulky side. Audio is louder enough but not that sharp and crisp. Battery charges ultra-fast backup is also decent and justifies 4820mAh.The most important thing for me is - network connectivity in which, this phone really disappoints me in a big-way. My earlier VIVO Z1X used to have strong connectivity in the closed-door area whereas this phone has only 2-3 bars on the same place. My main reason to buy this phone was - to have strong connectivity and rapid response of screen and processor but it doesn't behave like 6GB RAM. It satisfies me ONLY in Fast Charging and Batter backup rest all are not up to the mark...Sorry Mi fans, this is what my sincere observation is from 4 days' usage. I wonder, If 4G connectivity is not so good then how come we expect 5G to be beneficial. The side-mount finger sensor behaves strangely. Sometime it is fast and sometime doesn't recognize.I do not know whether Mi can fix all this thru OTA update. If so, Mi can add one more customer in their family. Thanks!"
1,During launching time amazon didn't give full details of this phone.NFC sensor not available.
1,"Really disappointed. Gets hot even with general usage, battery getting drained, pathetic speaker, I wish there were some review before I purchased it. Regret my purchase. The only thing that is great is camera quality."
4,The phone was amazing except call recording issues... There is no automatic call recording option.although u record ur calls... There is no voice
1,"Not a good product. It's like any sub 15k mobile with 5g processor. I did not like it at all. One thing I cannot understand that why these stupid mobile companies are kept increasing the length of mobile unnecessarily. Considering the width, the length is way too long, useless and makes the phone unhandy. A phone screen must not be larger than 6 inch and length should not exceed 16:9 screen ratio. Idiot companies are just racing to show their screen larger on paper to compete with peers.Update: The phone screen damaged with a very-very mild impact while the company says it has gorilla glass protection. Now had to pay 9500 for screen only :( I cannot believe I had wasted 22k and now had to waste another 9500."
3,other then 5g you can take poco m2 pro.poco m2 pro is very better in that price.Rate of mi 10i is little high.Approx cost may be 16-17k.

Memory management on 6gb Variant: while writing this review itself, I opened the camera app to check the modes for a couple of minutes (Vpn and tidal are running in background playing music through LDAC) and Amazon got booted out of memory. That's how bad it is xD. Luckily I copied it to the clipboard. I don't think 8gb Variant would be any better. 6gb should be more than enough for this particular use case. Never had such issues with evolution X. Games, yes but Amazon being booted out is unacceptable. Yes this is done to preserve battery life but the trade-off is too much.Update: apart from that one day, it hasn't been a problem. Do note that I don't game a lot. Personally haven't seen any issues with Truecaller or SMS organizer.  c. These two are the major annoyances but there are a few others too. LDAC bitrate must be set to 990kbps from developer options which again resets to adaptive bitrate evertime you disconnect and reconnect. If I'm enabling LDAC I already know the trade-off and I'm willing to take it. Why bother about altering it? HDR resets, as said above. Will update if I encounter any more.d. Ahh forgot the good old security app scanning every app that's downloaded, even from play store, which are already protected by play protect. Another privacy concern right there. Every brand does that but not as evidently as Xiaomi. At least there aren't any ads unlike the redmi phones with India region. Another plus for mi 10i over note 10 maxe. Autorotate is bad... Ik it's bad in almost all phones but in stock android (evolution X), when you turn it off and if it detects orientation, it gives you a tiny rotate icon on the bottom left corner and if you click on it, it changes the orientation... It's not just a handy feature but an essential one especially with a Broken autorotate. Idk why these OEMs remove features of stock android in the name of customisation..Conclusion: These annoyances are not much compared to what you're getting in terms of other aspects but these are what reduces the experience to a 4 star. That being said there can't be a phone with no compromises at this price and tbh, the ones on mi 10i are easier to live with. It gets most things right and most people will be happy with it. It looks good, feels good, fast, has excellent camera and doesn't skip on basic sensors like the Samsungs and motorolas at this."
5,Bought phone for 6200. Met my expectation with this price. This phone comes without Chinese apps. Camera is OK. 4 hours usage... Comes for two days. Good for online classes. What much liked is prompt response from company for email query...Surely nice phone...

4,"This the best ever non Chinese budget phone you can get at Rs. 10000 to Rs. 12000. I will provide you pros and cons of this Galaxy M11.Pros:1.  Great design, I really like the infinty O display (Punch hole camera design).2. Matte finish, so you can have better hold. (Also it won't shatter like glass, since it has plastic backpanel!).3. One UI - It is a great OS skin apart from Stock android and oxygen OS, and you will not get any annoying ads.4. Massive battery of 5000 mAh - Even with heavy usage, phone's battery can hold for a day, so if you are not a heavy user, you can charge once in two or two and half days. (And slower chip like Snapdragon 465 is additional plus, since it doesn't suck too much battery).5. Since it is a Samsung phone, you will get a minimum SAR Value (Radiation limit) compared to other Chinese brands, so it's good for your health too!6. Fast charging.Cons:1. Snapdragon 450, it is obviously slowest chipset in this price range.2. It cannot handle heavy games (Still i could play Call of Duty Mobile without any problem) (Edit: And Battlegrounds Mobile India too)3. Camera is not that great. (Edit: Improved with One UI 3.1)4. 720p display, could have given 1080p display.if you play heavy games, then you should be going for Poco M2, which is good in these range.if you are a normal person, who doesn't play much games (I do play games, but not most of the time), you can definitely buy this phone.And I say again, it is the best non Chinese phone you can get in this range with amazing design."
1,What !!! 13k priced phone with Snapdragon 450 processor is just a Worst thing. Second thing is it's front camera ... Which is Average... Guys you should go for Samsung M30 rather than this device... Because they have sold a old phone with new outer body... Phone performance is very low... This phone is not at all good for gaming and for photography ... A simple use of this phone ... But Battery is WATTA MONTSER !!!You will be loving battery of this device with 15W fast charging ... And no other good thing in this phone... Your mobile will hang during heavy multitasking because of very average processor Snapdragon 450 ...I recommend you should go for SAMSUNG M21 or SAMSUNG M30 or Samsung M31... They are incredible !!! Samsung phones are long lasting workable ... Phone will not get any problem for 1 to 2 years ... EAST OR WEST ... SAMSUNG IS THE BEST (expect Samsung M11üòÇ) üòã  - Real Fact
1,"Please don't  buy this phone  or any new series  of Samsung  like M11,M21,M10,M20 etc. I have bought M11 4GB ram phone ,after two month it became dead totally, power button wasn't  working  properly  & charting  point was problematic, Samsung  service  center  told me that there will be 8300 rs needed to repair  this phone & I can't  have free service  due to liquid  issue  damage  and so I have to abandon  this phone  & warranty period became myth  as I lost 14000rs on this phone. I had used Samsung  Galaxy J3pro  model for five years but none of these problems  occured. My wife has M20 model & from the day she bought  it the display & other parts of this handset  still remains  problematic. So my suggestion  is the old series was really good but the new series of sansung are all problematic, so please before buying  these models  think twice everybody."
1,My mobile is 1week old.There is sensor issue.Thumb unlock takes time. We need to give thumb impressions  twice or thrice to open.After call ends when we remove mobile from our ear immediately  sensor doesn't  recognize.  We need to press lock button then only light comes on display.This is irritating for regular user. This issue should be resolved by Samsung.There is no replacement  also.
4,"I have used the phone one week and then writing a review. Its an awesome phone with great features.Great battery life, no lagging, very smooth.Except the front camera which is 8 MP it is really bad quality one.üòÖBack camera is good of 16 MP its a mediocre level at this price(hazy cameras).If you want a phone for office use and multitasking only but not so much photography within affordable price then go for it."

1,"Mobile phone is not working,  showing error .We're sorry that you received a defective product. Please contract amazon customer service,"
5,"The Samsung Galaxy m11 is a great phone in itself. But the major thing I want to focus on is the price; the phone is for 9k which is really a good value seeing its brand and the specs. The performance of the device is awesome and seeing the price point, it is good for gaming (as it comes with snapdragon 450). The RAM and the SoC is the best combination at this price. It is a great device for small multitasking and can handle workload. The camera is also great with its triple lenses (out of which only two are useful) and can take amazing videos in lowlight. The display is awesome and the touch sensitiveness is great. But this device too has some cons. First of all, let me talk bout the os. At the time of opening, it had OneUI 2 based on Android 10, which gave an amazing battery life (nearly 3 days in light loads). But this changed when I upgraded it to OneUI 3 based on Android 11. The battery life significantly got reduced. The phone used to get warm while charging, and it performs slower when the RAM used to high up (these all problems were not there in OneUi 2). The fingerprint sensor is a bit slower.But at the end of the day, the phone is great and can totally give you a full day of battery and also the screen is really awesome. I will tell if you are getting it for such a low price, consider it as you are left of two years of software updates and three years of patch level update (the phone comes with three years of software update but at the time of buying, it has already got a year of update)."
3,"First time I purchased any Samsung phone and it's pain!In just 10 days touchscreen stopped completely working on left side. Contact Amazon, they are saying we have 7 days replacement only, contact Samsung they will pick your phone from your place and service and deliver. But irony is Samsung not even answering the phone properly.Phone is getting hang again n again and this touchscreen issue is completely making me mad."
3,Samsung M11 Pros- 1) Display--  Nice but of course FHD displays are always catchy.2) Network speed good.3) Nice call quality.4) Camera not bad comparing ti the specification and should get greater than 2.5 marks  .  But still5) Does not feel heavy. That is very nice.PhoneCons-- 1)Samsung displays  are always harmful to sensitive  eyes.Samsung M11 I am not sure but does not uses PWM controlled brightness.  But the blue light filter opacity/opaqueness/yellow tiny cannot be increased beyond default and most probably that s hurting to sensitive  eyes. Those who uses samoled displays with no eye trouble  I think shouldn't  suffer from this. But others may. I have complained to the company to update and look after the matter.  They should  also give LCD displays .Micromax  has always given displays  good for eye. To me that is the most important rather than other features.2) Speaker sound may be little louder though not bad.
5,"It s wonderful,  handy. Mobile.  I m 70+ n it s more convenient  to  me to access  this mobile.  So far I  have  no negative  to say. While using  Camera Photos r very crystal  clear. In kerala  raining  heavily  n m facing  electricity  problems  but because  of my Samsung  m11 approximately  48 hrs , m using for  watching Facebook, u tube, google news ,watts up, making  calls  etc. Good  phone  in  100 percent  basis"
5,"The battery life is promising, UI is great, also the phone an apt weight so that you are aware of holding a phone. Processor is judged old outdated in most comparison websites. After using it I must say it does a fine job. Hence I would say this choice is good for Parents, or people who are focused on having a smartphone because of its necessity. Then hands down this is a good buy!"
1,"Very slow incoming call volume/ringtones even after adjusting all advanced settings. Switched from Nokia for the first time to Samsung, thinking it has bigger Ram/storage and better battery, but discovered that this new Samsung is not much of a smartphone, it feels more of a basic phone being forced to do the job of a pro. Lags, jams, drags at every button, online shopping has become a headache. Most frustrating mobile experience. And I don't care about taking pictures on mobiles, but yes, camera is absolutely dull/primitive. Never saw so many lame things in any of my old Nokia phones."
2,Pros -Battery lifeLarge screenCons-Phone freezes sometimestouch screen not responsive enough. Scrolling is a big pain on thisfingerprint sensor sometimes does not workoverall not a good phone at this price range. u will be irritated because touchscreen is really bad. even if u type very fast it will not catch up
5,"I love this product. Best android phone I've ever seen in this price range! Battery life is pretty great although, screen quality is pretty nice as well. Samsung M-series is the best for students and people who can't afford expensive phones because, it provides the same features as those so called- expensive phones! Camera quality is pretty good with a triple-rear camera and a real cool front camera. Best affordable phone with all features you could get!"
5,"Great phone at this price range. Works perfectly. Battery life is superb. Violet colour looks fresh, catchy and awesome.Definitely worth it. Value for money.Recommended"

He just makes calls & runs basic application.This phone is not even worth for it.""battery life"" - that's ok ok. ""camera quality"" - the worst easily.and ""screen quality"" - thats an ok ok too."
5,The Samsung M11 is and all rounder phone. Even though it does not have a phone cover and earphones in the box It's battery life is long and good. The touch screen it good and is water resistant. The camera quality is also good but I have seen better. The gaming speed is very good no lag unless you have network issues. In all I give this phone a 4.5/5

1,"The Samsung Galaxy M11 mobile sadly did not live up to price tag of 15000Rs on 2 accounts :Display: The screen had a old pale yellowish color tone to it which have it a cheap look.Sound : poor sound quality, (this is in comparison with moto g5s plus which has similar price range) the volume is low and there is no clarity with more noise along with music at full volume.The fingerprint sensor is quick and efficient though. No comments on battery life as opted for return as I was very disposed about the two issues I mentioned earlier.To anyone who cares even a little bit about display and sound, I recommend never by this phone.The return process is long and bothersome as there was only exchange option and no return the first time I tried. And for exchange had to meet with Amazon technician who told the product can be returned by calling customer service. So called customer service only to be told only exchange is available(again) as only after exchanged once can it be returned. So carried service centre again after exchange to opt for a return as refund. Finally I have returned the product and waiting for refund to be credited in another week or so. The return itself took a week. The return process is a big drag so I recommend getting a detail picture of the product by going through the reviews before deciding to buy it."
4,"Mid Range Smartphone by Samsung..!!!Pros :-1. Non Chinese Brand.2. Clean samsung UI.( No bloatware ,No Add )3. Bigger Battery.4. Decent Camera.5. Screen Quality is good at this price of range.Cons :-1. Samsung must provide atleast Screen Guard.2. No back cover ( other Chinese brand are providing , so why Samsun doesn't )3. Charging time is more than expected .( We need more higher output charger)."
5,"Nice display also that phone for all Normal user play any type of game, Use any Normal apps. This phone has simplistic OneUI based on Android 10. Brightness light is good for your eyes. This has no unnecessary apps. This has October Security Patch. No Ads No Recommendation. 5000mAh Battery takes time to 1% - 100% - 3h max and Use 1.5 days max to max 2 days. Camera Quality is Good.  Signal Strength is Good."
1,"The worst exeprience I have ever went through.The product is defective, although the samsung is ready to replace the product, but the Amazon is misguiding me.Amazon should not misguide their customers, or else it will result in negative effects, if this type of response is happening.No one is responding from Amazon.I think the worst ever."

4,Was delivered quickly and on time is a perfect condition and safe pakage. Thank you amazon for tht.Totally value for money phone. Cant get all tht it gives in 9.5k and u get samsung brand too. Its satisfying specially when u dont want to buy a made in china product and get a good brand compared to the cheap Chinese brands tht look good and show to b hifi but last vry short. Coming to my M11 Except for the camera (which is expected to b average given 13mp) rest phone is value for money.  It came with Android 10  but Got an instant update for Android 11 and has almost  all the features as in my a50 which i also use along.Battery life is perfect charges quickly with a 15w charger.Ram is 4gb but the OS totally balances with is n dosent show any lag anywhere.Screen is big and truely HD quality.Weight is little high 197gms if u use it for long thn u might feel it otherwise short interval use no prob at all.Sound though the speakers r not stereo but they r quite loud and sharp.If ur looking for a average use smartphone of a good brand and below 10k must go for it.
1,"charging not proper,damage near charge point,very bad experience with amazone customer care,After given return request person not pick the phone for replace.He return and customer care plan to technical person visit after three four call 14 sep2020 which is too late.Not satisfied with receiving both mobile phone SAMSUMG M-11.I want to return both phone and want my money in my account."

5,"The Samsung Galaxy m11 is a great phone in itself. But the major thing I want to focus on is the price; the phone is for 9k which is really a good value seeing its brand and the specs. The performance of the device is awesome and seeing the price point, it is good for gaming (as it comes with snapdragon 450). The RAM and the SoC is the best combination at this price. It is a great device for small multitasking and can handle workload. The camera is also great with its triple lenses (out of which only two are useful) and can take amazing videos in lowlight. The display is awesome and the touch sensitiveness is great. But this device too has some cons. First of all, let me talk bout the os. At the time of opening, it had OneUI 2 based on Android 10, which gave an amazing battery life (nearly 3 days in light loads). But this changed when I upgraded it to OneUI 3 based on Android 11. The battery life significantly got reduced. The phone used to get warm while charging, and it performs slower when the RAM used to high up (these all problems were not there in OneUi 2). The fingerprint sensor is a bit slower.But at the end of the day, the phone is great and can totally give you a full day of battery and also the screen is really awesome. I will tell if you are getting it for such a low price, consider it as you are left of two years of software updates and three years of patch level update (the phone comes with three years of software update but at the time of buying, it has already got a year of update)."
3,"First time I purchased any Samsung phone and it's pain!In just 10 days touchscreen stopped completely working on left side. Contact Amazon, they are saying we have 7 days replacement only, contact Samsung they will pick your phone from your place and service and deliver. But irony is Samsung not even answering the phone properly.Phone is getting hang again n again and this touchscreen issue is completely making me mad."
3,Samsung M11 Pros- 1) Display--  Nice but of course FHD displays are always catchy.2) Network speed good.3) Nice call quality.4) Camera not bad comparing ti the specification and should get greater than 2.5 marks  .  But still5) Does not feel heavy. That is very nice.PhoneCons-- 1)Samsung displays  are always harmful to sensitive  eyes.Samsung M11 I am not sure but does not uses PWM controlled brightness.  But the blue light filter opacity/opaqueness/yellow tiny cannot be increased beyond default and most probably that s hurting to sensitive  eyes. Those who uses samoled displays with no eye trouble  I think shouldn't  suffer from this. But others may. I have complained to the company to update and look after the matter.  They should  also give LCD displays .Micromax  has always given displays  good for eye. To me that is the most important rather than other features.2) Speaker sound may be little louder though not bad.
5,"It s wonderful,  handy. Mobile.  I m 70+ n it s more convenient  to  me to access  this mobile.  So far I  have  no negative  to say. While using  Camera Photos r very crystal  clear. In kerala  raining  heavily  n m facing  electricity  problems  but because  of my Samsung  m11 approximately  48 hrs , m using for  watching Facebook, u tube, google news ,watts up, making  calls  etc. Good  phone  in  100 percent  basis"
5,"The battery life is promising, UI is great, also the phone an apt weight so that you are aware of holding a phone. Processor is judged old outdated in most comparison websites. After using it I must say it does a fine job. Hence I would say this choice is good for Parents, or people who are focused on having a smartphone because of its necessity. Then hands down this is a good buy!"
1,"Very slow incoming call volume/ringtones even after adjusting all advanced settings. Switched from Nokia for the first time to Samsung, thinking it has bigger Ram/storage and better battery, but discovered that this new Samsung is not much of a smartphone, it feels more of a basic phone being forced to do the job of a pro. Lags, jams, drags at every button, online shopping has become a headache. Most frustrating mobile experience. And I don't care about taking pictures on mobiles, but yes, camera is absolutely dull/primitive. Never saw so many lame things in any of my old Nokia phones."
2,Pros -Battery lifeLarge screenCons-Phone freezes sometimestouch screen not responsive enough. Scrolling is a big pain on thisfingerprint sensor sometimes does not workoverall not a good phone at this price range. u will be irritated because touchscreen is really bad. even if u type very fast it will not catch up
5,"I love this product. Best android phone I've ever seen in this price range! Battery life is pretty great although, screen quality is pretty nice as well. Samsung M-series is the best for students and people who can't afford expensive phones because, it provides the same features as those so called- expensive phones! Camera quality is pretty good with a triple-rear camera and a real cool front camera. Best affordable phone with all features you could get!"
5,"Great phone at this price range. Works perfectly. Battery life is superb. Violet colour looks fresh, catchy and awesome.Definitely worth it. Value for money.Recommended"
1,"Got a defect piece, mobile got switched off, pickup team is not picking up as they are not able to check IMEI number in the phone and Amazon is not refunding the money as it is not reached them, Almost a month now, still issue is not resolved"
1,"I have bought this phone (4GB ram version) with Moto G8 power lite on same time.I bought this for my Father as gift & Moto for my mother.Within few days my father was so fed up with this phone because of its made & features. He just makes calls & runs basic application.This phone is not even worth for it.""battery life"" - that's ok ok. ""camera quality"" - the worst easily.and ""screen quality"" - thats an ok ok too."
5,The Samsung M11 is and all rounder phone. Even though it does not have a phone cover and earphones in the box It's battery life is long and good. The touch screen it good and is water resistant. The camera quality is also good but I have seen better. The gaming speed is very good no lag unless you have network issues. In all I give this phone a 4.5/5

1,"The Samsung Galaxy M11 mobile sadly did not live up to price tag of 15000Rs on 2 accounts :Display: The screen had a old pale yellowish color tone to it which have it a cheap look.Sound : poor sound quality, (this is in comparison with moto g5s plus which has similar price range) the volume is low and there is no clarity with more noise along with music at full volume.The fingerprint sensor is quick and efficient though. No comments on battery life as opted for return as I was very disposed about the two issues I mentioned earlier.To anyone who cares even a little bit about display and sound, I recommend never by this phone.The return process is long and bothersome as there was only exchange option and no return the first time I tried. And for exchange had to meet with Amazon technician who told the product can be returned by calling customer service. So called customer service only to be told only exchange is available(again) as only after exchanged once can it be returned. So carried service centre again after exchange to opt for a return as refund. Finally I have returned the product and waiting for refund to be credited in another week or so. The return itself took a week. The return process is a big drag so I recommend getting a detail picture of the product by going through the reviews before deciding to buy it."
4,"Mid Range Smartphone by Samsung..!!!Pros :-1. Non Chinese Brand.2. Clean samsung UI.( No bloatware ,No Add )3. Bigger Battery.4. Decent Camera.5. Screen Quality is good at this price of range.Cons :-1. Samsung must provide atleast Screen Guard.2. No back cover ( other Chinese brand are providing , so why Samsun doesn't )3. Charging time is more than expected .( We need more higher output charger)."
5,"Nice display also that phone for all Normal user play any type of game, Use any Normal apps. This phone has simplistic OneUI based on Android 10. Brightness light is good for your eyes. This has no unnecessary apps. This has October Security Patch. No Ads No Recommendation. 5000mAh Battery takes time to 1% - 100% - 3h max and Use 1.5 days max to max 2 days. Camera Quality is Good.  Signal Strength is Good."
1,"The worst exeprience I have ever went through.The product is defective, although the samsung is ready to replace the product, but the Amazon is misguiding me.Amazon should not misguide their customers, or else it will result in negative effects, if this type of response is happening.No one is responding from Amazon.I think the worst ever."
4,Phone Is AveragePros -1. Back Camera Is Average2. Big Battery3. It's slim4. Fingerprint Sensor Is Fast5. It's Bezzleless6. M11 Comes With USB Type CCons -1. Front Camera Is Bad2. Samsung Shoud Have Give More Powerful Processor According To Price3. It Come's With Plastic Body4. It Easily Scratches5. No Gorilla Glass Protection6. This Phone Price Should Be 9k To 10k
4,Was delivered quickly and on time is a perfect condition and safe pakage. Thank you amazon for tht.Totally value for money phone. Cant get all tht it gives in 9.5k and u get samsung brand too. Its satisfying specially when u dont want to buy a made in china product and get a good brand compared to the cheap Chinese brands tht look good and show to b hifi but last vry short. Coming to my M11 Except for the camera (which is expected to b average given 13mp) rest phone is value for money.  It came with Android 10  but Got an instant update for Android 11 and has almost  all the features as in my a50 which i also use along.Battery life is perfect charges quickly with a 15w charger.Ram is 4gb but the OS totally balances with is n dosent show any lag anywhere.Screen is big and truely HD quality.Weight is little high 197gms if u use it for long thn u might feel it otherwise short interval use no prob at all.Sound though the speakers r not stereo but they r quite loud and sharp.If ur looking for a average use smartphone of a good brand and below 10k must go for it.
1,"charging not proper,damage near charge point,very bad experience with amazone customer care,After given return request person not pick the phone for replace.He return and customer care plan to technical person visit after three four call 14 sep2020 which is too late.Not satisfied with receiving both mobile phone SAMSUMG M-11.I want to return both phone and want my money in my account."
4,"Best for basic user.I bought this phone for my mom. And used for 7 days. As of now no complaint.I have Samsung M21, everything is same  as M21, only camera quality is not as expected. But at this price it's really okay to buy."
1,"Extremely disappointed. Faulty product delivered. Not replaced. Service promised, but technician did not show up. I am left holding a total dud with a lot of material damage."

2,"I ordered for red color one,  but received the Pink color. It is to be noted that price for red is higher than that of pink.  Phone is an Ok kind of product, battery last for one day with limited usage. Signal reception is bit low. So it will work only  if your are having good network coverage."
3,"If backup improves it will be a very good product. Sound features are too good. Call quality, music player, all good but back need to improve. Only listening music 3 hours will work. Which is not a good thing."

4,"Let‚Äôs make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve ‚Äî the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in ‚Äî the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricingüá©¬†üá™¬†üá∏¬†üáÆ¬†üá¨¬†üá≥¬†Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I‚Äôd still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What‚Äôs more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn‚Äôt strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.üá©¬†üáÆ¬†üá∏¬†üáµ¬†üá±¬†üá¶¬†üáæ¬†The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it‚Äôs large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it‚Äôs an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it‚Äôs just not bright enough.üÖ±üÖ∞üÜÉüÜÉüÖ¥üÜÅüÜàThe battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow ‚Äî the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?üÖ≤üÖ∞üÖºüÖ¥üÜÅüÖ∞There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There‚Äôs an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps."
5,Awesome
1,"Very bad experience from Amazon. Very bad camera quality of the phone. I want to return the phone, but amazon is not taking back the phone. I don't want to purchase any product from amazon further. Leaving amazon app permanently"
5,Best buy at this price! The display quality is amazing and I do not have any complaint with the camera too. There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.
4,i didn't upload photo ....for any reason but it is not up to the mark .1.display 4/52.cam 3/53.fing sens.. 4.5/54.processor 3/55.build quality 3.75/5back panel is not good looking coz some self design as per my opinionin this price segment rs 9000 is good enough
1,This phone is not value for moneyIts a downgraded phone of earlier phone launched in india.The camera is worst i ever seen in any redmi phone.Battery is ok.The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.Dot notch display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera.Recently i am using redmi note 5 pro. And this phone is just downgraded phone by redmi .you cannot imagine low light photography in this phone.The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 prime.
5,Good product value for money but ordering is too difficult within one minute soldout
4,Product is best at this price but charging speed is very slow but we cannot accept more then this at this price
5,Good mobile

4,Overall its good and satisfied for the price.Pros:1. Good Battery.2. Best budget phone for 8999 with 4GB RAM and 64GB Internal Memory.The only drawback i felt is Camera.If you are looking for a better camera I would suggest to pick some other model.
5,best good product prive battry camera all very good
5,GOOD
1,"It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile."

3,"Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware. Unauthorised data transfer to China.If possible go for Motorola E7 around the same price and you will have great experience with Snapdragon and clean android experience."
3,Charging Adapter came with phone turned out to be defective. stopped working after 2 weeks of purchase.Don't know how to return the adapter or how to claim the warranty on adapter alone.Phone is working fine so far and looks good

1,I really disappointed with this product
1,not a good phone. Poor performance . Even it says Realme C11 at some place. Seems faulty phone
4,"I think I am the first buyer and this is first review of this product. üòÑI got it for 6299 Rs in big billion sale.For the price, it's display is bright and good quality. It has type C port which is exciting.(i found out later that it's not type c) 5000 mah battery. 18 W charging. Processor is good for mid graphics games like hill climb racing and few shooting games. It can play pubg but you won't enjoy it much. It can handle day to day apps like Whatsapp, facebook, instagram, chrome, youtube without any lag or heating. Camera is average but for this price it's good. Clickable pictures.It has realme ui which is features loaded. Best UI. I have 3 realme phones and updates are never delayed. Hence company really backup product after sales.Don't expect performance of a 10k or 15k phone. Compare it with realme C11 or redmi9a.Product description mentioned type C charger. That's really misleading. Really bad Marketing.1 star deducted.And yes Mint green is best color. ‚úåÔ∏è"
5,My phone not real which my order is realme narzo 50I but I check in this phone setting about phone realme c11
3,"Even in Settings ---> About phone ---> Device name,  it was mentioned as ""realme c11 2021"" . Ughhh... Atleast you guys should have changed that...."
1,"This was cheated by realme. its not norzao 50i, it is resale of Realme c11. May be they forgot to change the nameüòÄ. I never expected this kind of UI and OS from realme mobiles. Setting options and display and app management is worst. With this phone you can't call any customer care bcuz u can't select the given IVR options."
3,Totally disappointed with Realme.Micro usb charging.Overall phone is okkBut either you can buy realme C11 2021 in less price
1,Video Player is loading.
1,has basic camera.. no use at all.has 5000 mAh battery and no fast charging . so u will have to keep it charged. so its more like basic power bank which will take more time to charge.charging port micro USB not even type Ctouch is very bad. phone in pocket sensors does work. will have to disable it. So completely useless.speaker is mono but quality is below average or very bad.even calling page will take time to go from 1 page to another.Add some money to ur budget and go for better phone. This is worth less phone.expect looks nothing is good in this phone.My suggestion:: do not go for this phone
5,Value for money but fingers print sensor is missing in this model. No back cover in the box as mentioned in spec's.
1,By look phone is nice. Back cover is not provided as mentioned. Camera quality is very low. Most importantly as phone name is showing realme C11 instead of narzo 50i. Amazon or seller should spet up and clear the things as it is confusing the customers. I don't know this phone is real Or someone cheat me.
2,AGAIN NO CASE IN REPLACED PHONE AS ADVERTISED IN THE AMAZON SITE. PLEASE CLARIFY WHEN DO WE GET THE CASE. ALSO THE PHONE MAY BE DEFECTIVE BECAUSE THE SIM TRAY IS NOT OPENING. WHY SO CARELESS WHEN SENDING PHONES TO THE CUSTOMER THAT AFTER FIRST COMPLAINT / REPLACEMENT. GET BACK TO US IMMEDIATELY WITH CLARIFICATION OR SUGGEST ALTERNATIVE.
5,All over good to use but they says the box include cover type c cable but this phone box coming with micro usb and don't have a cover and back plastic body poor i think..
1,"Waste of money  , wifi not working properly..my other 2 phones showing full signal strength but this phone showing only 1 signal strength and not able use wifi properly. Getting disconnectedNo option to return!! Utterly disappointed."

4,"When we see the system name it will shown as realmec11 2021,but when we updated the software the name and function must changed into narzo 50i,no one notice that. This is a good budget phone and i am purchased at a rate of 6700 from amazon. Delivery is too fast and  5star rating for Amazon delivery partner."

5,"Bought it on the first day of launch. Delivered the next day. Very fast delivery by Amazon. Have been using it for last two days.Pros1. Phone has glass at the back which gives it a premium look. Feels stylish to carry it along.2. As usual, Samsung screen is smooth. Good picture clarity.3. Adaptive brightness 8s one of the best I've come across till date.4. Phone is very light.5. Camera quality is also very good. Front camera is also decent.6. Battery life is more than 24hrs for regular browsing over 24*7 wifi connection.7. Fingerprint sensor on right side is handy.Cons1. Charger is only 15 Watt. 25/30 Watt would have been better.2. Nothing else as of now.I feel good holding and using this Phone. If there is any chance then I'll update the review."
1,"Speakers are very very weak, produce very low sound, you will need headphone or speakers to listen music, I purchased it on first day and now they are just offering replacement which will not solve the purpose as every samsung M32 5G phone has this problem so I would recommend others to not waste their hard earned money in this phone as cost is too high compared to quality"
1,"Phone look is nice,Battery drain 65% after normal use 4 hours and 15 min.Camera is not as 48 mp if I compare my vivo phone 13 Mp is better than thisIf I talk about all over performance so phone is only good looking else nothing is in this device is goodPlz don't waste your money"
1,"I sold the phone sameday somehow on olx in 4k loss. Amazon doesn‚Äôt provide return.Phone is a joke.Plain M32 had full hd screen and now with 5G price has gone up by 6k and display is surprisingly half hd(HD+) . This is plain loot.Plastic is cheap.Camera is worst than any 10k phnSlow processorEven screen lags in scrolling, such bad refresh ratePathetic Processor and ramOverall its from 2012 times where HD+ was a thing. This phone is 9 yrs late.Never buy samsung in this segment."
3,They really need to work like motorola
1,Dislike- camera
4,"Received what I ordered.Received on time which is good, Thanks Amazon Team.Good Quality mobile from Samsung.Cheapest 5g ever with 12 band support.Purchased for my wife she is happy with phone.This worth and value for money üí∞ I would say.Sky Blue üîµ color looks premium!"
1,"After using one month I am writing this review,1. Galaxy M30s is better when compared to M32 5G, M30s has good battery capacity and camera quality,2. The camera quality is poor and the pixels.3. In this phone we can expect only 5G option that too we have to check after upgrading the sim.4. Regarding softwares I will post after updating the new software installation from Samsung,"
2,Over heat is produced while charging and when wattsapp messages receive and downloading. Spoke to customer care executive but they are not ready to take return
5,"Smooth touch, future ready with 5g, sleek design, expandable memory option upto 1 tb.First impression of the phone is good,when used phone continuously for over 2 hrs, videos and downloads and battery went from 50% to 25%, so i expect it to run for a day with full charge. Fast charge is also excellent, but not like other fast charges available in market. Its 1 min for 1% approxThere has been a issue with the M series of phones with UI not responding and system hangs, but this processor on m32 seems to be strong and they have I reckon resolved the issue (recommended not to use Samsung in build apps much as they consume lot of data and there is unnecessary lots of cashed data stored).Camera is OK, but they have lot of features like macro cam for close up night mode and have snap chat filters pre-added on camera which makes it fun and handy.Overall a perfect buy at this price range."
4,"Cons:1. Charger Adapter is only 15W Fast Charging unit. It takes  nearly 2 hours to get fully charged2. Charger wire length is less than 2 feet (comparatively less to the normal length of Charger wire )3. Fully charged phone will stand only 1 day if we use the phone at full level (use internet + calls ) through out the day.Pros:1. We can use secure folder option for securing confidential info/apps and data when we hand over the phone to some body either using finger print or pin or a pattern which is different from phone pattern.2. I got phone with RAM of 6 GB and installed several apps and used , phone doesn't show any slow down in speed.3. Finger print sensor at side switch on/off button seems to be attractive."
1,"Good phone till now except the finger print button location which accidentally pressed always when we are holding the phoneUpdate: reducing a starFacing glitches, not able to hear when I call to some body at first, if I keep try 2nd or 3rd time, then only I can hear.If it connect first then voice is not clear. Never faced any of these in my earlier realme phCharging time taking hell lot of time.Update: pls don't this phone, it's speaker is not clear, when I call its giving some disturbance not able hear the voice clearly"
1,"It's a worst mobile phone ever, Samsung proof that they are loos their credibility in India. This phone can not be worth more than  8k to 10 k. Camera is very poor, You can only use single Sim if you are using Micro SD card, Display is very poor , plz don't buy this phone. I think Samsung is going footprint of NOKIA ."
1,"The quality of camera, screen and performance or not at all good.camera quality is very very poor not even capturing photo like a phone of cost 3k. And the return policy of amazon was worst. Not a proper response by the executives of amazon. They are not accepting the return of this product, don't know the reason behind this. Dont  Why they are enecouranging sale of this product,  when they are getting similar problem form multiple customers.  Belief on amazon have worsening day by day.. literally disopinted with the amazon."
2,I personally  felt  display and front cam  ok ok but atleast rear cam for 23k 48mp its not good quality also. I am preferred to buy Samsung  but not this model
5,Video Player is loading.
3,"I have multiple feedback or this model. Overall I can give is 3 star only.Battery life is GoodDesign and look is goodBut there are many cons:Display looks very much shrinkedCamera specially in night mode is very very badFinger print reader most of the times does not take it. Tried many many times adding fingers and changing it, but reader quality is very badCharging cable received in the box is very small. Power adapter is of poor quality.Loud speaker is not at all loudOverall not very happy being a Samsung customer and Samsung product."
1,"Battery of Mobile device is what energy is to a living being. M32 5g has a very poor battery. Had bought this branded device with much expectations but this device's poor battery performance has let me down. Above all, replacement request was also not honoured by Amazon."
2,I have brought this phone during the first day of launch. I was expecting something better could be involved in this mobile but literally waste. Phone is getting heating issues while we speak any calls for appx 10 to 15 mins. I have started seeing hand pain issues after using this phone within a week. Its feels very heavy while using it. Its better to look for some other less weights phone to work.
4,"Gorgeous Blue glass body. Quick charge. Good screen, but not Crystal Clear. Samsung Apps are Confusing. Little heavier. Battery holding not that longer for the given capacity."
1,"Samsung M32 5G is a rubbish mobile from Samsung and more than that Amazon has a return and replace policy.  No return even if there is a problem with the product.  Remove Friends Samsung and Amazon from your life.  Both are waste of money and waste of time.  Amazon does not replace even after giving a bad mobile.  If there is such a policy, who will buy the product online?"
1,Box seal damage.Everyone please be aware
5,Perfect as per the specifications given in this price.
1,Vestage of money produt display not good
1,As per this price range it is absolute pathetic quality of front and rear camera...after going through review video I had purchased this phone ...but it is absolutely one of the biggest mistake.Camera quality is just like 10000 to 15000 rs range.it is totally not worth the money of 26000 rs.
4,"Using for a day. So far all Good. Back side Diamond  finish great. Material also Good.  Camera - Good, bright picture. Rich in color may be corrected. Display Good. Operating Good. Charging okay. Not so fast. Can be improved. Overall a Good  phone value for money . Request to bring it to 20K range to be Good seller . Thanks for a Good product. Being phone is very light it slightly vibrate on playing Loud music.  Will update soon."
5,"11 Lite NE 5G coming under xiaomi is truly an awesome and premium phone. It's the lightest phone I've ever used and the features are no less than any other phone. The 50+ director modes, dolby display, 10 bit amoled display and 90hz refresh rate makes this phone more special. The battery life is also pretty good."
1,"1. Storage becomes inaccessible after disabling work profile for all apps in personal profile.2. Work profile button on notification bar doesn't light up or grey out.3. You cannot pic calls if something is running picture in picture, the caller notif will slide up and down like an animation but call cannot be picked up.4. Disabling work profile disables application running in dual mode as well.5. DnD does not disable notifications nor silence calls6. Pictures/screenshot will not be stored because storage is inaccessible7. Also, if you raise an issue, the technician will take bribe to let you replace the product.8. Customer support is pathetic, they won't let you return the product, continue with there useless support call."
1,1. Not value for money.2.Camera not worth for 28k range3. MIUi is worst. I was not able to remove control center toggles.SUGGESTION: DON'T BUY
5,"For under Rs 27,000 people are expecting the same value they would receive from Rs 1 Lakh+ iPhone 13 Pro Max.Granted most of the reviewers on YouTube were overtly heaping praises on this phone (mostly paid by Xiaomi to do so). Probably that's the reason many of you were disappointed by this phone when you finally got it in your hands.Think of this phone as iPhone SE of the Android world and you will understand the true value for money of this phone.Pros:1) 21 4G LTE bands, no one gives so many LTE bands on a mid-range phone. NO ONE. Not even Xiaomi did this before. This is probably the first time Xiaomi is so generous on the LTE bands, I hope they continue this trend. This allows us to use the phone almost anywhere in the world while traveling. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who travels to different countries without worrying if their phone will work or not.2) 12 5G bands, good to have. Makes the phone future proof. But do consider Indian operators haven't chosen the bands yet. So we still don't know the 5G bands working in India in the future.3) 3 years of Androids updates and 4 years of security updates. My second reason to get this phone after the LTE bands.4) Overall performance is smooth and without any hiccups. Some may not like MIUI. But I am happy with it, they don't have bloatware anymore and even most system apps can be deleted.5) The feel of the phone in hand is amazing. I don't like my phone to run my life, I want to use my phone as a slave and only use it when i need it. Since this phone is thin and light you can easily fit in your pocket and forget about it.6) Incredible screen: the 10-bit AMOLED screen is just amazing for watching Netflix.7) Camera: It seems that many are complaining about the camera. I don't understand why. It's really good and I did not find any issues with it.Cons:1) If you keep the screen at 90hz the phone will heat up. I don't mind 60hz but to many this could be a deal breaker. Again think of this phone as iphone SE of the android world.2) Warming issues: There is a weird warming issue. NOT HEATING but warming. I don't know what tasks warms it up, its very erratic. Same task or app next time might not warm the phone. It's weird. After the latest security update it has seemed to stop.3) Xiaomi paid too much to YouTube reviewers unnecessarily hyping up the phone unrealistically instead of showing true value and use case of the phone. This phone is NOT PERFECT. But close to getting all your job done without any problems, a really well done phone for this price point.Recommended for- Travelers, because of the generous LTE bands this would be a best phone for the globetrotters.- someone who needs Long battery life, I got about 7 hours of screen on time on heavy usage (Camera, social media, work, maps, netflix everything minus gaming).- anyone who wants to feel secure because of the software updates.- Netflix viewers, this phone would be a perfect treat for you.NOT Recommended for- Uber drivers, food delivery guys or anyone working under the sun for too long. The warming issues might cause a problem.- Gamers. The phone can handle games but because of the warming issues gamers might not have the best experience.- Anyone who wants fast refresh rate screen. This phone supports 90hz but it heats up at that rate.. You need to use the phone at 60hz to avoid heating.Overall this phone can be very good for value for many especially travelers, if you watch a lot of netflix and someone who works on the phone a lot. Xiaomi took some really good steps in the right direction with generous LTE bands and updates.Almost all YouTube reviewers ruined this phone for many with their greed for money. For example this phone comes with wifi 5 and a plastic back. Many Youtube reviewers falsely claim that it comes with wifi 6 and glass back. Even the most famous so called trusted ones.Edit: Switching off auto brightness seems to be solving the warming issues."

1,Battery draining too fast in day 2 day usage
4,"Light weight, slim and lends a premium look & feel due to its glass gradient back. Back camera struggles in low light condition. Macro shots are eye pleasing. Selfie camera takes decent photos. For my kind of usage, battery lasts for more than one day with 90 hz refresh rate. Coming from ColorOs, MUI 12 is a new experience for me but I did not like it. Did not notice any lag or stutter while using this device.For users who are not addicted to intensive gaming, they can happily coexist with this device for their day to day usage and yet own a premium segment all rounder."
5,Nice display n cam and in last 5g 12 band outstanding coverage go for it buys
4,The phone is good with amazing  specs But the MIUI is very buggy eg many PDFs don't open from many apps

4,I'm happy value for money üòç
5,"The first look of the phone made me remember my iPhone 6 which is slim rest have to use it for further review yet if your are looking for a multitasking phone with good quality camera and little gaming with full 1 day battery this is your phone got it for 23499 ( 6 gb 128 ram) during Amazon offer oct 2021 using amazing offers by Amazon,most important for me is xiomi dosent lower the price to a extent where it hurts the first buyer, comes with charger, cable and a transperent case so no spend on accessories, if u still want they are comparatively cheaper and pocket frendly most important xiomi has a service centre at most of the district head quaters across India no in case of any issues"
5,"It's a mid premium smartphone and it's so light and slim. The phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G which is good and  you pretty decent performance for the price.The display is 10bit 90Hz Amoled and it also have Dolby Vision , the HDR content on Netflix are so good to watch with Dolby Vision.It also have stereo speakers, a plus point here compared Realme GT ME which doesn't have stereo speakers and also no HDR support for Netflix.It have a triple camera setup it's okish not so great not so bad. It have a decent camera. The telephoto macro camera is awesome and allows you to take great macro shots.The battery life is also Good ,as this is slim phone the capacity is 4250mAh it takes through a day with normal usage , and also comes with 33W charger.The networking and WiFi performance is also good and also have carrier aggregation.The MIUI is surprisingly smooth will optimized on this phone and Xiaomi has promised 3 years Major Android update and 4 years of security updatesThe phone is may not look value for money like other phones in the market as this phone is a new segment target different consumer. The introductory price with Amazon offer was a great deal though.It feels light, looks good and gives a reliable performance.  The phone is also future proof for 5G with 12 Bands."
5,"Got this instead of GT master in sale.Pros : -SlimGood Looking (Diamond Dazzle)Clear and loud Sound {Vibrates on more levels though}Good cellular receptionMore 5g Bands- Future proofingVery good wifi coverageInbuilt Camera features like vlog mode and othersI don't game ,using it for regular office and daily tasks only. So This gets me around 9 hours + backup which I believe is very good as I have to charge it next day morning or late night.Cons :1.Flashlight is okayish can't be used as a torch, even old samsung has better coverage2. Camera is good but I feel front camera could have been betterWill add if find any other cons.."
3,"I didn't feel much difference when compared with my previous MI note 5 pro usage. Only reason for my purchase was that this phone has 5G and lite weight and it has served the purpose. Lite weight, Yes. Can't say about 5G right now..Plus, I being a prime member feel cheated for buying the phone very early in the sale. I got a discount of ‚Çπ 1500 on exchange which if bought now (without prime membership I suppose)would have got ‚Çπ 3500 discount on exchange..... Sad but true..... What's the message for #primemembers by doing this?"
5,"Using this phone almost 5 days now.Sharing this review so that you can decide if you want this phone Or not.Display: beautiful screen edge to edge display great visibility on screen. 4k videos are looking beautiful in this screen.Camera: lots of feature in camera. You can record 4k videos upto 30fps. Good camera setup.Processor: 778G I must say great performance I played BGMI, Carx rally, COD, Real racing3. These are the games with good graphics and believe me there is no lag while playing these games.Battery: Nice battery backup depends on your usage. Fast charging is good.Design: lite weight and sleek design amazing looks.If you are looking for a phone for design, camera, performance. GO FOR IT.BUT BUY 128/8"
5,Got this phone on great indian sale with my old phone exchange... Must say worth it... Build quality good... Camera is descent.. And it has got 35W fast charging...
3,"Use it n then I promise you will not regret. Thanks to MIUI 12.5, AND Andriod 11, also chipset 778 is highly optimised to enhance the experience."

4,"There are few bugs i face from starting, they might be fixed after updates1. sometimes fingerprint not work properly i have to touch multiple times to open it2. Battery drains little bit faster, but it has fast charging support so there is no issue with it3. About screen, i downloaded few 4k videos to check screen quality and i noticed major frame drops during playback in some videos (like nature videos)3. Except these 2 problems everything was best, no complaints about any other things, i hope they will fix this with updates"
5,"Good Mobile with descent battery and camera, can play bgmi games without any hurdle. 4g+ carrier i am getting on both sim, fast, no hang issue till time.Battery last for 1 day, full charging does in 50mins ... Charging speed is good, no heating issue while playing games or watching videos, Bluetooth connectivity is also good with tws."
5,Phone quality good .other features also good.lekin ek hi drawback hai.CAMARA:IF YOU CLICK PHOTOS FAST IT WILL CAPTURE BLURRY PHOTOS.WAIT FOR FEW SECONDS AND THAN CLICK IT WILL CAPTURE GOOD PHOTOS.XIAOME NEEDS TO IMPROVE CAMARA QUALITY IN SOFTWERE UPDATE
4,"Model Bought:- Jazz/Bubble gum Blue, 8 GB RamNote: If you are a gamer, this phone is not for you.Pros:This phone was a steal deal during Amazon Grand Festival sale for 25,500/- for those who were looking for budget premium mid range phones.The sleek and super light body with Jazz blue color will make you instantly fall in love as soon as you will hold it.I have seen on youtube that reviewers are praising Diamond Dazzle and Tuscony coral colors only, but I would say that this blue color is underrated. It looks awesome as well.Phone has great display(to be honest, I have compared it with OnePlus 8 Pro) and good camera(actually unexpectedly impressive during night).Combination of SD 778G and 8 GB ram will handle all your day to day task pretty smoothly, so you can load your phone with all kinds of apps. Let me just say that you don't have to worry about any lags here at all.Battery and charging speed are also good. My phone is easily lasting more than one day with medium to heavy usage. And if you are a fan boy of ultra superfast dart charging speed then you might find it slow otherwise I would consider it a decent charging speed(takes a little more than an hour for full charge).I see some users have raised heating issue which I find surprising as I am a heavy gamer and phone tester and I haven't encountered such problem while using the phone. It gets a little warm during prolonged usage(which is expected and acceptable). I have experienced hot body temperature only when I was charging my phone and playing games simultaneously(which is anyway not recommended at all)As this phone is having MIUI 12.5, obviously you would get a lot of customization option. Xiomi phones also include a lot of small but very useful features in-built like memory cleaner, second space and many more which are good to have.I would like to highlight one thing here that if you have heard about Super Wallpapers in MIUI,  those are not available! I hope it gets released with the MIUI 13.Lastly, for gamers, you will be disappointed. The phone is having a powerful processor-ram combo and and a good GPU as well, but I think the software needs a lot of attention. Surprisingly it handles intensive games like FreeFire and Genshin Impact prettly well(you will see some frame drops in between but those are very less and ok - won't impact you gaming) , but fails to perform while playing average games like Clash Royale and Angry Birds Transformers, it stutters a lot like a cheap 5-10k phone even though I was playing them in Game Turbo mode :(Summary:The only reason I have given it 4 stars and not 5 is because of  dull gaming experience. Otherwise, if you are a fan of light weight and slim phones which is powerful and premium looking as well and under 30k, this is probably the best choice for you."
5,Xiaomi 11 lite NE 5G. A great premium midrange device with gorgeous look powered by an extraordinary piece of hardware engineered to perfection along with cool and customizable software with assured Android and Security updates. Well done Xiaomi....
4,"The phone is almost an amazing device. I used it over a week days to review full..Display- Top notch, good crisp colour with vivid video experience. 10 bit display is amazing when you see movies or ott content.Looks- Killer looks with both side glass, back is not slippy. White and blue colour suits well.Processor- All new SD 778G runs apps, games(haven't tested hard) , videos etc like butter smooth.Battery- Works a day for me with over 6hr 30 min sot.Bundled 33w charger charged it over 1hr.Camera- Macro shot is justsuperb. It has many photo and video modes and clicks almost decent pics.Audio- Dual speaker does good work. Sound is loud and clear and even better in headphones.Call quality and reception isgood. It comes with built in NFC.Miui 12.5 is out of the box which has many features. Though it has many bugs like colur haziness, sloppy dark mode, mi keypad also glitches , app shutdown, proximity sensor problem, sudden frame drops etc. Let's hope when update comes.However Amazon's sellingpolicy of this phone is verybad. Exchange value andOther bank offers should be fixed in festive time. I almostloss 4k as after buying thisphone the price slashed onAmazon.4 star for this phone and 2star for Amazon shopping experience."
4,Product is decent. But what advantage prime members got from Amazon? Almost prime members lost ‚Çπ1000 on earlier access purchase. Is it correct? Amazon has to refund excess amount collected from prime members on par with non-prime members to justify good business ethics.
5,"Overall, the display quality is top notch. Fingerprint sensor is blazing fast. Phone charges quickly with 33W fast charger. Best mid-range phone in the Indian market right now."
5,"The best part is, it is so light. Never knew how much I hated bulky phones.Truly the most competent and feature-rich phone in this segment."
1,"Hell!! Lots of software & hardware issues...!!!1) I'm not able to open it when I try to open it with my passwords. Disgusting thing!! Might be a touch issue or something don't know.2) The phone is heating while charging and after using 15-20mins itself. The battery also draining like anything.3) While playing BGMI, mobile is heating like anything.4) The headphone connector jack quality is the worst...5) In dark theme black colour keyboard changes to light brown colour!!6) An automatic Call recording option is not available!!7) While using a keyboard, I felt there is a touch delay or touch problem!!8) As they said charging is not too fast!!9) With this price range, plastic bumps are not so good. Mobile is lightweight but MI definitely compromise the build quality.10) camera is not what we expected in this price range.11) Replacement options are not available and returning the amount to Amazon pay is not worth it at all (still not sure about the return and replacement policy)Very irritating Fedup of these all..."
3,"Phone is light weight and takes time to get used to MIUI interface (this being my first mi phone). Battery back up is good and charges 100% in less than an hour. No 3.5mm jack is a disappointment and makes life difficult to use the converter and headphones. BEWARE!!! After the festive season sales, the price got reduced by 1k further after exchange and all bank discounts. Don't fall for marketing gimmicks"
4,A perfect combination of  Technology with smartness. very handy phone with all the required specifications  needed for a daily use. Nice colors. good sound output touch is good .
3,"Writing this review after 7 days of use...Camera quality is pathetic, just like 10000 to 12000 RS range.  No option to capture pics with Side Mounted fingerprint scanner  Camera Lovers, don't go for it...Battery back up is up to 7 hrs only.Loud speaker quality is no that much good. No bass effectUnable to record sound using Screen Recorder(Zoom Calls).Contacts: No option to see how many contacts we haveScreen not turning off during the call and this is inconvenientNot worth the money of Rs. 29000/-Good DesignGood DisplayNo issues with Amazon delivery"
5,I liked this phone very muchPros1. good camera2. super display3. super speaker4. super built qualityoverall super packageConsMiui bugsPrice
2,"So long story short, I purchased this phone and the unit I received had a display panel issue known as ""black crush"", I was very disappointed that a Phone that's having its Display Panel as it's USP is having this issue.So I applied for a replacement, and after many painstaking days of follow-up with Amazon I got my replacement.But to my disappointment the replacement phone also has a weird panel issue, wherein, in low brightness you can see faint black lines running down the panel.But now I'm tired of applying for replacements and I don't know if the replacement would have an another major defect bigger than this one.So my verdict for this phone would be is that Xiaomi's build quality is becoming more and more questionable these days as they keep on churning out more mobiles than a rat has babies each year.I don't think my next phone would be a Xiaomi."
4,"Pros:1. Lightweight and well-balanced. Looks premium.2. Reasonably sized camera bump.3. Good bright screen. No problem in usage outside in day time.4. Decent battery. I got 24 hours standby time with 5 hours screen on time. Good enough for a typical day usage.5. Both side fingerprint scanner and the face unlock work nicely. There is no delay or missed authentication.6. Cell signal and WiFi signal reception is pretty good. Call quality is exceptionally good.Neutral:1. Decent camera. Color reproduction is good but images start pixelating soon if try to zoom in. Feels like Xiaomi is compressing the images too much during post-processing.2. No 3.5 mm jack but has usb-c to 3.5 mm adapter bundled in-box. It works nicely.Cons:1. The UI is laggy and animations are jittery. It's still very much usable but should be much better on a phone costing 28000.UPDATE- The UI has improved significantly after recent update.2. No gestures on third party launchers. All because Xiaomi does not want to improve its implementation of the system-wide gestures on MIUI.3. Dolby Vision is just a gimmick. All HDR checking apps along with Netflix will tell you that it supports Dolby Vision. But 778G processor does not support hardware decoding of Dolby Vision content. You can check this by trying to play any Dolby Vision demo video after downloading. MX player will try to play using software decoding but it's not watchable.4. Any 4k 60fps HDR video stutters and there is a lot of skipped frames and audio/video sync issues (check on YouTube for 4k 60fps HDR videos). This processor should be able to play this. So, again MIUI has tried to overoptimize something and broken simple things in the process."
5,Pretty slim and fast
4,"Tecno spark 7 is best mobile ,this price renge ,awesome performance ,,and look like very good  Thnku techno ....."
5,"It's almost a week I am using this phone. First of all, really loved the colour. Wasn't sure if it would be as good as shown in picture but it is. Ordered the green one. Second, the battery surprisingly lasts for a long time. It takes a little time for phone to get fully charged, but once it is, I can get a lot of work done. If you are looking for screen size and battery you can go for this. To top that there's an amazing camera. Loved the filters in the AI Camera and the portrait mode."
5,I have been using the phone for 1 week now. The phone is very smooth and you can multi-task easily.The camera (both rear and front) are really good. The pictures and videos are very sharp and well lit. I experimented with both Macro and low light photography. The results are quite good. Highlight: The AI feature automatically switches to the mode.Battery is good. 6000mAh.  I charge it once a day and easily watch movies and play games.Overall a very good buy.
5,"More than 10 days of using phone.Very happy with big screen and battery backup. Good for watching youtube videos, facebook videos and pictures.Looking also very smart. Stylish and nice color.Android 11 is available which is latest. Good phone with nice features in this price."
2,"Some software issues incurred within one week, alarm stopped working in spite of several resets."
4,Initially I was very skeptical to buy this mobile or not. But somehow made up my mind to give it a try. After using it for almost 1 week I can say this is the best mobile in this price range. Camera quality and Battery life is superb. Did not observe any slowness or hang while opening the apps. Overall very satisfied with the product.
1,"Updating my review after using the phone for s couple of days. It's a total waste of money. I have received a defective product with the fingerprint scanner not working properly. It has been confirmed & verified b Amazon that it's indeed a defective product as I was asked to download an app called Blanco application, through which Amazon can verify the internal health of the mobile. The battery is the only plus point with the mobile. Camera is ok for the price range but the volume is pathetic. There is no separate speaker provided by the manufacturer. This is the first phone of it's kind that houses a tiny speaker through which you can hear the voice call & the same speaker is usable for hearing the ringer & the music. So basically if a person is even a bit faint on hearing, one cannot ether her the phone ringing or any music properly. The phone looks very nice to hold & to see. However unless you are planning on using it for just display purpose, please DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. It's a literal waste of money. I am totally surprised that in times like today with so much competition, when other cheap/expensive, both mobiles are coming with dual speakers, stereo speakers with a nice audio, spark techno has not provided even a single mono speaker at the back of the phone or at the bottom. They could have charged an extra amount to their customers for provision of at least one speaker if not two. I seriously feel that this phone does not deserve even a single star & hoping that Amazon discontinues selling this brand on their site as any customer will feel cheated after buying this phone."
1,Working very very slowly 2gb full slow first time coming mobils Back cover including good but recently sold not like No cover So not good this time received
3,"Music lovers and Camera lovers, plz don't buy this phone.. very bad sound. even when it rings, i feel irritated by its bad quality thin sound. both camera are worst. Rest all things are good in this price. I got it for 6500/-.. Don't buy it for more than 6700/-...wait for the offers and then its price drops. Good for first time smartphones users.. Posting this review after one week of usage...."
5,"Bahut badiya phone hai, pakadne mein ek dum solid lagta hai, design bhi aisa hai ki premium look deta hai, display, camera, battery, looks-everything is perfect. Ab aur kya chahiye bhai."
5,The phone is awesome for the price ..Cuzz their is no other brand that offers seamless stock android experience at this price range...And it is a indian sooo.... If the products from your country are offering such good value why go for anything else....Overall a great product
5,Guys trust me this phone is the best phone regarding.1. Battery2.  Smart look3.  Video quality4.  Picture qualityBest phone under 8000.  Go for it.  I m really happy to purchase it. Please don't load games of other software.  Use this phone as simple as u can.

1,"On 31 Jul 21, I put my Tecno SPARK 7 on charging first time since I did not use my phone earlier due to non-requirement. While charging at 36%, the adapter has gone unserviceable. I tried another adapter with the same cable, it is working properly. Kindly replace the adapter or refund money, whichever possible."
4,Every thing Is good but the charger in the box is normal that charge the phone very slow that's why I give 4 star.Other than that this phone is good at this price range. It battery backup is 2 - 3 days at no heavy usage and can give more  also.And it can give battery backup 1 day at heavy usage.
3,"Phone look and body are good but I have issues with working,Phone get re-start automatically, it get hot sometimes, frequently hanging this all are things which I don't like about the phone"

3,Camera quality is very bad. They don't look like 13 mp and 5 mp cameras at all. Phone came with a video which shows that the camera has 3 modes including bokeh mode. But my phone only has bokeh mode and other 2 modes are missing. It is either a fraud from the seller or from the company.Phone is not able to catch network easily.Battery is good.

5,I like most of the things about this phone except the ipc  lcd screen. At this price point you guy could have implemented amoled. Other than that i love this phone. Thank you iqoo
1,Please don't buy this phone. Display quality is pathetic and a black shade around the corner. There is no refund offering by Amazon for this product even the complaint was raised on the same day of delivery.
2,Start to hang from secong day have to reboot it dropping data network very frequently tried with all 3 service provider still same Did not see the issue with any other brand phone
1,Wrong information provided about specification there is no NFC on this phone but i required NFC I already do the complaint to Amazon the tell me to wait 3 days we will solve the problem but if there is no NFC in hardware there is only one solution refund my money and take back this phone
3,"Design of the product is fabulous, But Battery is not upto the expectation it drains faster, Doesn't looks like 5000mah. Options are as usual, which is user friendly. Not worth in this price range. R&D needs to be done more on this product.Charging wise it's really good as given in the specification. Camera features are also Good, otherwise it's okay except the battery draining issue and price."
5,"Value for money. Must buy this mobile.I have ordered this twice.Nice pictures comming from the camera.5000mAh takes around 50-60mins to get full charge.Nice battery backup, last upto 40hours once get fully charged.Nice sound.UI is also good.In terms of display you can feel amoled touch."

1,Simply waste of money.
1,I am businesses user I select for record option but no use. I came to know now using the google dialer & also it have bug to record the calls.I asked Amazon to return but no response iqqo also say they fix the bug in update but not said when.Please don't buy if you use for business.
5,"Processor - SD 778 is awesomeBattery - 5000mah is good, drains faster when using 120hz and 44W brick does the job well.Camera - Back is great, front is good enoughDisplay - Being IPS LCD, it's not bad at all but not as good as AMOLED obviouslyRAM - LPDDR5 flagship qualityStorage - UFS 3.1 one of the fastest of all segments. Only phone with this in the price range.5G - 2 bands, n77 and n78 but as n78 i.e. 3.5Ghz is the most common band around the world and one of the only band usable in India currently it's not gonna be a problemFor the price it's a very good product with solid performance.If you've got more budget then you can go for MI 11 lite 5g which is a bit better specs wise."
3,"Got it delivered on 7th October 2021Pros:- Camera is good.- No heating issue so far.- Battery backup is fine and would work for 1 day or 1.5 days ..depends on usage then.Cons:- So much hype about speed of the processor and other stuff like DDR5 RAM n all..but didn't notice it as such. Infact my OnePlus 5 works faster than this phone. Compared and tested both phones side by side.- It's a Heavy phone..quite heavy- ofcourse as mentioned in specs, no amoled display.- the pre-installed apps are really a waste to have. Some can be uninstalled but most of them cannot be removed.After using premium phone like OnePlus 5, this phone won't excite you much.After exchange n all other coupons and cashbacks, I bought it for 17290 rupees. So it was a deal breaker for me."
5,Superb camera.No heating during charging..No heating during pub g game.Body was perfect.Display colours also very good.Camera is great. It can also capture liw light photo s clearly. And also have timelaps option in video. And also have Astro mode to capture photos of Stars.Fast touch response.Still good phone after using 1 day.0-50%charge in 34minutes when phone is switched off.
5,"The iQOO Z5 starts at Rs 23,990, and for the price, is a worthy option as it performs well and offers a good-looking, robust design. What's more, the handset charges reasonably quickly too, offers loud stereo speakers and snappy biometrics. Of course, those looking for the best gaming phone will find it hard to turn a blind eye to the POCO X3 Pro. Moreover, folks who enjoy watching movies on their phones will be better off with the Realme GT ME , which costs more, albeit ships with an AMOLED display. Lest I forget, the Xiaomi Mi 10i is still the best camera phone under Rs 25K.Clearly, the iQOO Z5 has a lot of competition, but I am happy to buy it and still feel confident in recommending the phone as it offers a well-rounded package that will suit most buyers. Do let me know which phone you would pick if you had a budget of Rs 25K .Pros:Best for gamers in 25k rangeStylish designGood performerCharges quicklyExcellent hapticsCons:Main sensor clicks oversharpened imagesSub-par display."
5,Video Player is loading.
1,"The phone is full of ads on every app, ads on Netflix, and other prime apps wow.As I log in to my google and another account within few minutes I got a notification from Google and Facebook your account is locked please verify it's you. (someone from Russia trying to login into your account etc.)Phone quality low full plastic body, not worth for 10000 also.Please don't buy this phone coz I feel all this from my side thanks"
2,"Overall it's a good device, but mine presented a few problems like jio 4g+, call not clear, data and touch laggy, plus os not very smooth evem with 120 hz refresh. Replacement requested. Let's see how it turns out."
5,"Awesome Phone.1. Complete Package .2. All rounder.3. Flagship Performance.4. Battery capacity brilliant  easily use in a day.5. Performance fast because LPDDR5 ram or UFS 3.1 Storage.6. Camera Quality Also Brilliant.Important---Over All ,A very Good package.In This Price Point."
5,"Display is average ips (not bad , average for 20k+ price)Camera is your average 64mpBut performance and speed are flagship level. In gaming and app opening its flagship.Charging is fast , takes around 1hr for full charge.Battery life is average, but you can go 20% to 80% in 30min.I am getting small updates every week .No major issues.If you notice most 1 star reviews are from paranoid people. Like One guy is like ""call recording is not working so 1 star"".I am very happy with my purchase."
2,"Primary camera is worstSpeaker sound is average.Bit heating issue while doing intial setup, don't know what will happen later.No lag this might due to 8gbFlash charge not working charge phone for almost 30 mins charged from 21% to 55%Design, color, display looks cool."
5,Good
4,"I have had used many Redmi phones. I am comparing this with my Poco M2 Pro:1. Narzo sure does feel premium compare to Poco. It's OS is clean and blotware free.2. Narzo feels much lighter, but I weigh on scale Poco and Narzo weighs the same. I think Narzo has better weight distribution.3. Camera is good. I feel no difference compare to Poco. Night camera is average, it cannot capture all the details what our eyes can see in low light. Poco too doesn't fair well in low light.4. Calling is okay. Speaker volume is much low: forget using speaker phone. Poco has very loud speaker volume. This is only downside.5. I liked Amazon giving flat exchange for older phones, albeit lower than Flipkart. Flipkart devalued my phone further upon inspection even though phone met all the checks.6. Summary, if you are tired of using Redmi phones, this is better option @ 10K."
5,"Very happy with Realme UI and the phone‚Äôs build quality. I was not happy with Redmi phone OS and wanted Realme phone for my mom around 10K. This one is really good. Pleasantly surprised that the user interface is on par with Google Pixel 4a stock Android. Weight of the phone is evenly distributed, so won‚Äôt feel its heavy. Not very bulky and good battery backup as well. I think Realme should be the brand to go for budget phones. Yes there are so many models, but we have many options to choose."
1,Most worst part of it is Amazon is backing it and causing problems to the customer. Please don't buy this product especially from Amazon. In India there is trust issues..
1,"There is no official Information, If it has gorilla glass.They do not provide back cover only Screen Protect Film is provided."
1,battery issue and SIM card slot 2nd not working; Call Amazon Customer support they are not even trying to help me over this issue saying you need to wait for some time instead also checked by their tech support team in all ways by downloading the app and performing the test.So not recommended the Purchase of a Phone over Amazon like a lot of issues and not resolution with Tech-Support.Rather buy from somewhere else.
5,"Thanks to amazon for this product  & for your best services you always provide.  Fast delivery, nice packing by amazon.This phone looks good. Blue color looks cool. Camera is ok not looks like 50mp but it's ok. Battery back up is also fine. Speaker sound is also fine.I got what I wanted. Face unlock feature, fingerprint sensor, fine camera, fine speaker quality, good battery back up, 128 gb ample storage, 4gb ram. I think these are the features which most of the people want. I don't know whether it has the gorilla glass or not.At Rs 9,999, I bought this phone & I am satisfied. Looks are also good."
4,I have purchased this @9800..rupee symbol is not there in QWERTY..strange..decent phone at this price.. of course display could have been better..phone is little heavy..above 200gms..camera and sound quality is good..no mobile case in packaging.. overall good phone @10 k price
5,Nice phone good camera and sound quality fast charing nd many more features at ds price .
1,No replacement first time in history product defected unavailable to teke photoFlash light intensity very low
5,"I purchased it during the sale period. I got it for Rs.9500/- and after initial usage i feel like it is more than worth for the amount i paid. The delivery was prompt. The phone is simply superb. The camera is good, finger print sensor works quick, also the same with facelock system. I am 100% satisfied with this Narzo 50A. I purchased a tempered glass and a cover from the local market as they were not part of the box. It would have been nice if Realme provided a standard TPU case as it is common now a days from all manufacturers."
1,"Not charging properly and heating problem, tried to contact customer care, not helped me"
2,"First of all those who wants best performance phones can buy this and don't expect anything other than this.Pros:Super performanceBattery lifeRealme UI 2.0Cons:1. Camera ( Worst even if it 50MP it takes pictures like 5MP. Front camera is too dull.  My old Redmi 4 phone gives good front cam quality than this. Front cam worst.2. Display (It gives 360pixel output when videos Play in 720p. Even 720p wallpaper also displays like 320p)At least they should give FHD display.Even 9K price we get FHD display.3. No case provided, no inbuilt tamper glass( For this price these to be included in the box)4. Last but not the least, Overpriced. These featured phone to be come in 9000/-This is my review frnds, those who needs only performance can buy this. For other features don't buy."

1,Bakwas Q ke sound problamAal sound very low. Not extra speker only one speaker incoming and out goingBakwas third class mobilePlese this mobile not purchesses
4,"Hopefully, a fair review after 24 hours of usage.Pros:1. Camera (both front and back) - A very decent one even on low lights.2. Huge battery backup - It can really withheld for 3 days for day to day usage.3. Performance - Fair one TBH. Obviously G35 at this price range is upto industry standards.4. Android 11 out of box. Hope Tecno keeps the device updated for next two years.5. Display - Bright and crisp (though 269ppi). But upto standards and smooth touch sensitive.6. Flash lights - Perfect and bright 4 LEDs at back and two in front. Front LED is also bright enough. One of it lights up during charge inlet with dimmed brightness.7. A plastic back case and screen protector film (already applied).Cons:1. Missing Type-C. It is micro USB.2. Battery - Charging duration takes ages. 3+ Hours!!3. Finger print scanner - one of worst at this price range. You had to adjust the finger to find right spot.4. Bloatware - Huge list of uninstalable list of apps.5. Front LEDs - No option to be used for notification alerts.To conclude, good one at this price range. But honestly, it could have been a 500 bucks more lesser considering branding which is striving to come up. One can easily go for top brands in market for the same configuration with and additional 500 bucks. Hopefully, Tecno doesn't let their customer down like the way other few brands did."
1,Very poor quality phone don't buy this phone phone is very slow and hanging problem heating problem also
1,sound and camera quality not goodPicture Quality badCamera performance averageSound Quality very very poorTotally disappointed....

3,"There is some lag while opening apps, speaker quality is not good, otherwise everything is good at this price (got at ‚Çπ7999)"
5,"Its a value for money phone. You can't expect smooth performance from a low budget phone like this. But this is a very good mobile for daily uses.With heavy uses it gives 2days battery life.Both the cameras are on par. Nothing great, nor bad.Lots of bloatware on the UI.Loudspeaker volume is little low, but sound while calling is very clear and high.Overall it's a good phone for the people who have tight budget or doesn't need super camera/gaming experience."
4,Speaker quality is not upto the mark
1,Worst sound quality 1st day hang finger print not work properly totally unsatificed with this mobile. I was asking about return this prodcut but amazon is refuse this i lost 9000 rs. I am never ever buy from amazon. Totally dissapointed

4,"*PROS -1.Battery backup is amazing.2.Rear camera quality is awesome, Front camera quality is good.3.phone design is unique & attractive.*CONS -1.Support only 10W charging.2.Only one Speaker for both calling & Music.3.Fingerprint sensor very bad,It doesn't work properly, it works 4/10 times.I give 0 rating for fingerprint sensorSo,i said to tecno to fix this problem.,Otherwise phone is awesome."
5,"Camera - Nice camera quality as it has one AI Camera so it makes picture so much brighter.Battery - Battery is awesome, very good battery backup. Even after 2 hour continuous gaming, battery gives great backup.Processor - No lag at all if you are doing gaming or anything, it's performance is awesome.Best phone by tecno in this price. You should go for it ...."
3,Good phone in this price segment.Pros-1. Better battery performance2. 48mp camera3. Unique designCons-1. Major cons _ fingerprint is not good.It works worse.i have never seen this type of fingerprint in smartphones in last 5 years.2. Micro usb cable3. Speaker quality4. Location of power button.
3,Poor Product only thing that I liked is camera which is good at this price range... but other than that it hangs a lot...and heats up as well.. no recommended..this is my 1st and last tecno Product..bye bye tecno..
5,"I bought this phone without knowing much about the company. It was just a gamble which paid off. I got it at Rs 7740, and comparing it's specifications with its price, I feel it is a steal deal.Pros at this price:6 gb RAM and 6 gb storage_5 starsCamera AI and 48 MP _5 starsFinger touch sensor_4starsFace unlock sensor_ 5 starsBattery life _ 4 starsTouch and feel _5 starsSoftware is similar to OPPo but response is better.Cons: a bit heavy ( may be due to huge battery)Overall a good purchase."
3,"Review after 40days of use , The net speed is mostly bytes /sec. not connecting to online classes at this speed. I haven't seen in bytes /sec.  in my other mobiles. To attend online classes mobile data is not going to be used as the speed is b/ s.  The mobile has good features 4gb RAM 64gbROM, 48MP rear camera  + AI camera, front camera 8MP, 6000mah battery @ Rs 8000 is  good but netspeed in this phone disappointed alot.  If you watch movies or attend online meetings then don't ................................ don't ................ ."
3,Good camera . Double flashing on front screen.Baterry life ok.Big screen.I bought it for 8599/-In this price everything is well good except the speaker üîä.They could have given a dedicated speaker for music and videos.
2,"Average quality. But I bought this phone with 48mp camera's expectations. I'm disappointed. My vivo phone's 13 mp camera quality is far far better than this. Finger print is always a problem. Sometimes touch screen also not working properly. Even though it has a 4gb ram and 64 memory I additionally added a 64 gb samsung memory card,, All after this phone is hanging and lagging..even contacts is opening slow. I don't have any big games on my phone though. Inbuilt palm store ads are coming daily to install some apps. Everything inside is Google's including Dialer. It has call recording option but you cannot record a call without other parties knowledge. When we press record or put it in auto record it says NOW THE CALL IS BEING RECORDED loudly. Which can be heard from both sides speakers. We are using record option for our safety purpose. If someone is harassing or bullying or even blackmailing how will we handle that. It is not women friendly mobile.. I suggest women not to buy this phone."
4,Battery: 5/5Performance: 4/5Camera: 3/5Speaker: 3/5Display : 4/5Don't get trapped for 48 mp.. it's very average .. except camera  rest all satisfactory
5,"Techno Spark 7TCondition 1- Battery status shows chargingIf we switch off the  power of adaptorCondition 2- if phone connected to charging ,if we toggle the power of adaptor (if power is on then switch of and on again)it shows symbol of charging butDoes not charge.Condition 3- it has no loudspeaker other than earpeace ,sound is not loud and clear when we play videoSo please return ,bcoz 7t me model ka software problem haiNo replacement no refund option given please dont buy at all"
3,I am happy to by this phone .. It's better than 5000-6000 MI brand phone ..1..Wifi catching system low .. other phone catching 2 bar but this phone catching null ..2 .. Network capping quality very poor ..3 .. Speaker very very low quality .. One head side speaker it's pathetic .. & Sound I am don't explain ..4 .. Fingerprint point sensor not good .. more than one tach then unlock..
2,"I am having problem with the speaker and mic. When we speak we get to hear our own echo. Other person cannot hear you and you cannot hear the other side. It's absolutely useless as phone. It is good as camera, games and extra things. Service is not available. The number they provide for service says he has closed down the shop. The other service centre is a repair shop who is working for the company as freelance. You have to give the phone to them if they can repair they will do it or else send it HO for spare parts which can take 10 to 15 days minimum ( that's the warranty coverage). If you have patience and a spare phone buy it on your own risk.New review as of today 19/9/21The other side cannot hear me.Very bad till today no body responds.Very very very bad"
1,It's have two main bug that you can't avoid1. Volume is too low . You can't listen music  after 3 to 6 months of purchase without earphone2. While charging ; charger heat too much.Otherwise it's good...But please buy until you ok with it.
4,"I gifted this to my mother, it's good and easy to use, camera quality is not upto mark anyone can recollect its digitally managed. Android version is good easy to implement could say better than other cheap devices from Chinese market."
4,"I bought this phone to gift it to my wife. She was always complaining on how her staff used to taunt her for old phone.Thanks Ganpati Bappa, I found tecno spark 7T phone which comes in unfer 11k price range but it is on Android 11.0What you may dislike is1. Two OS; one is Android 11 and other is HiOS7. Why to have two?2. Yellowish tint in camera picture3. Only two camera are givenWhat I like-1. Price range2. 48 MP camera3. Lightweight4.

1,"Battery won't last even half a day, lag and touch is ok. Weightless and it is slim. But overall no"
5,"I was not expecting such a good quality and features in this price range. Simple and good looking. Screen ration is perfect. In comparison to other nokia and samsung keypad phones, this was a good buy for me, as they are little bit costly due to brand name."
5,"The main reasons why I recommend others to buy :1. Not only loud sound quality but also Vibration while ringing.2. Comfortable to hold in hand.3. Best for day to day usage.4. The best thing is The company has launched it few months ago (Aug 2021) with adding some extra features (like Vibration mode) which was not comes with Lava A1 Josh. It is a big deal.One more fact is I am the 3rd person who review and buy it from Amazon, I was a riskey decision before placing the order, but after I received it I am satisfied."

2,Everything is good according to price(after applying coupon and discounts).Screen is quite more sensitive than actually being).processor quite slow.Quite heavy weight.Everything is good according to budget (10k)
1,"Camera quality is so poor, is not like 50 mp camera."
3,"Quick charging should be provided for this type of massive 6000 mAh battery, it takes 3.5 hours to get fully charged from 5 to 100%. It is a drawback of this phone. Camera (50 MP) is also not up to that mark, picture looks like oil paint. Message app is not good, it takes time to get loaded each time. Improvements to be done."

1,Very bad phone what I have ever seen. I bought this phone for my brother but it's stopped working from 3rd day.. Don't know how this handset got 4 star rating..Some times it's not getting ON if we switched it off. And once it's ON the touch facility not working. End of the day it was a sad experience. I have bought Redmi 9A last week through Amazon. And it was superb on this budget. I could have buy the same. I jst wanted to return this.3 times Amazon peoples came here to collect it. But they didn't take it back as the phone is dead stage. Very bad service
5,"I needed a base level smartphone for my father. He's a senior citizen so won't be using anything but to call & receive calls, read SMS's and this phone was gone beyond my expectations especially because it has a loud speaker on the backside of its body which makes it easy for people with reduced hearing to hear it when it's ringing.Software works well and comes preloaded with a lot of non-essential App's bit many can be uninstalled and the other stopped from auto updating themselves.Great value for money if you're looking for an entry-level smartphone."

5,Good 5G phone
5,"Bought it on the first day of launch. Delivered the next day. Very fast delivery by Amazon. Have been using it for last two days.Pros1. Phone has glass at the back which gives it a premium look. Feels stylish to carry it along.2. As usual, Samsung screen is smooth. Good picture clarity.3. Adaptive brightness 8s one of the best I've come across till date.4. Phone is very light.5. Camera quality is also very good. Front camera is also decent.6. Battery life is more than 24hrs for regular browsing over 24*7 wifi connection.7. Fingerprint sensor on right side is handy.Cons1. Charger is only 15 Watt. 25/30 Watt would have been better.2. Nothing else as of now.I feel good holding and using this Phone. If there is any chance then I'll update the review."
1,"Speakers are very very weak, produce very low sound, you will need headphone or speakers to listen music, I purchased it on first day and now they are just offering replacement which will not solve the purpose as every samsung M32 5G phone has this problem so I would recommend others to not waste their hard earned money in this phone as cost is too high compared to quality"
1,"Phone look is nice,Battery drain 65% after normal use 4 hours and 15 min.Camera is not as 48 mp if I compare my vivo phone 13 Mp is better than thisIf I talk about all over performance so phone is only good looking else nothing is in this device is goodPlz don't waste your money"
1,"I sold the phone sameday somehow on olx in 4k loss. Amazon doesn‚Äôt provide return.Phone is a joke.Plain M32 had full hd screen and now with 5G price has gone up by 6k and display is surprisingly half hd(HD+) . This is plain loot.Plastic is cheap.Camera is worst than any 10k phnSlow processorEven screen lags in scrolling, such bad refresh ratePathetic Processor and ramOverall its from 2012 times where HD+ was a thing. This phone is 9 yrs late.Never buy samsung in this segment."
3,They really need to work like motorola
1,Dislike- camera
4,"Received what I ordered.Received on time which is good, Thanks Amazon Team.Good Quality mobile from Samsung.Cheapest 5g ever with 12 band support.Purchased for my wife she is happy with phone.This worth and value for money üí∞ I would say.Sky Blue üîµ color looks premium!"
1,"After using one month I am writing this review,1. Galaxy M30s is better when compared to M32 5G, M30s has good battery capacity and camera quality,2. The camera quality is poor and the pixels.3. In this phone we can expect only 5G option that too we have to check after upgrading the sim.4. Regarding softwares I will post after updating the new software installation from Samsung,"
2,Over heat is produced while charging and when wattsapp messages receive and downloading. Spoke to customer care executive but they are not ready to take return
5,"Smooth touch, future ready with 5g, sleek design, expandable memory option upto 1 tb.First impression of the phone is good,when used phone continuously for over 2 hrs, videos and downloads and battery went from 50% to 25%, so i expect it to run for a day with full charge. Fast charge is also excellent, but not like other fast charges available in market. Its 1 min for 1% approxThere has been a issue with the M series of phones with UI not responding and system hangs, but this processor on m32 seems to be strong and they have I reckon resolved the issue (recommended not to use Samsung in build apps much as they consume lot of data and there is unnecessary lots of cashed data stored).Camera is OK, but they have lot of features like macro cam for close up night mode and have snap chat filters pre-added on camera which makes it fun and handy.Overall a perfect buy at this price range."
4,"Cons:1. Charger Adapter is only 15W Fast Charging unit. It takes  nearly 2 hours to get fully charged2. Charger wire length is less than 2 feet (comparatively less to the normal length of Charger wire )3. Fully charged phone will stand only 1 day if we use the phone at full level (use internet + calls ) through out the day.Pros:1. We can use secure folder option for securing confidential info/apps and data when we hand over the phone to some body either using finger print or pin or a pattern which is different from phone pattern.2. I got phone with RAM of 6 GB and installed several apps and used , phone doesn't show any slow down in speed.3. Finger print sensor at side switch on/off button seems to be attractive."
1,"Good phone till now except the finger print button location which accidentally pressed always when we are holding the phoneUpdate: reducing a starFacing glitches, not able to hear when I call to some body at first, if I keep try 2nd or 3rd time, then only I can hear.If it connect first then voice is not clear. Never faced any of these in my earlier realme phCharging time taking hell lot of time.Update: pls don't this phone, it's speaker is not clear, when I call its giving some disturbance not able hear the voice clearly"
1,"It's a worst mobile phone ever, Samsung proof that they are loos their credibility in India. This phone can not be worth more than  8k to 10 k. Camera is very poor, You can only use single Sim if you are using Micro SD card, Display is very poor , plz don't buy this phone. I think Samsung is going footprint of NOKIA ."
1,"The quality of camera, screen and performance or not at all good.camera quality is very very poor not even capturing photo like a phone of cost 3k. And the return policy of amazon was worst. Not a proper response by the executives of amazon. They are not accepting the return of this product, don't know the reason behind this. Dont  Why they are enecouranging sale of this product,  when they are getting similar problem form multiple customers.  Belief on amazon have worsening day by day.. literally disopinted with the amazon."
2,I personally  felt  display and front cam  ok ok but atleast rear cam for 23k 48mp its not good quality also. I am preferred to buy Samsung  but not this model
1,"Hi All, don't buy a nokia product during launch.I purchased nokia 6.1 plus for ‚Çπ17500, soon after around 6 months the same phone is available for ‚Çπ9000. It is exactly sold lesser than the launch price.Moreover the phone is not upto the mark. I face charging point issue every 4 - 6 months, I am paying 1.5 k every time. No proper response and solution from Nokia. Nokia has lost its quality."
1,Phone does not support 5GHz broadband speed.screen protector (preinstalled) is not tempered glass.Received July update for Android 11.
3,In the era of slik design nokia is producing bulgy phone.it is not having even g80 ..in which gen nokia is in?not even mentioned what type of ram.i don't know who gonna buy it?kindly improve bulid quality and design
5,"I have been using a 32GB Nokia 6.1 for the last 3 years. Nokia 6.1 was an Android One phone which gave me two Annual Android updates (from Android 8 to Android 10) and 3 years of security patches. The security patches stopped with the April Patch. This was the time I decided that I must now look for a new phone to continue to get monthly security patches and Android updates.Nokia G20 is not the ideal phone to replace a still sturdy Nokia 6.1. I did not see any other suitable Android One phone in the market to meet my expectations, so I settled on the Nokia G20 because of its ready availability.My 32 GB Nokia 6.1 was very tight on storage space and I had to regularly delete some files I would have preferred to keep. So I wanted a Nokia phone with 128 GB of storage that started with Android 11. Currently, I did not find any. So I compromised on a 64 GB Nokia G20.Before using the new phone I merged the contents of my and my wife's camera and WhatsApp pictures using a PC.  I did this so that I can continue to maintain them using the Google photos storage captured from two different phones. Now I had all the pictures taken on my wife's phone as well as the pictures she received on her WhatsApp. The merged contents from a 64 GB Nokia 6.1 and a Nokia 32 GB Nokia 6.1 could fit within a 64 GB Nokia G20 after deleting short-term Good Morning type messages.When the Nokia G20 arrived I charged it and copied the contents of my old Nokia 6.1 contents on the Nokia G20 from Google Cloud. This process did not go through as smoothly as my past experiences were. I did a factory reset of the Nokia G20 couple of times and still, it did not help. Things were not smoothly installing from Google Play Store. A few Apps did not get installed because they were very old and Google decided that they will not work in a new environment. Some old Apps, though they were working on my old phone had been removed in the Play Store and could not be found. Because of these anomalies, the automated restore process did not go through smoothly, and the App icons did not get restored on the screen.  So I manually installed all the remaining Apps from the Play Store and copied the App Icons to their familiar place on the screen. After restarting the phone everything seemed fine.Now I started WhatsApp on the new phone and restored the WhatsApp backup and it worked okay. Till now my sims were in the old phone and now I moved the sims to the new phone and everything seemed fine. After taking a WhatsApp backup and Google backup I was now ready to copy merged contents from the PC.The copy process from the PC to the phone took a long time because of the large number of small files. Everything now works fine and I can see the merged photo gallery. I once again backed up WhatsApp and Google photos to the cloud and now everything is fine and I still have 26 GB of storage for future expansion.Some of my observations:Moving from the 1080x1920 Nokia 6.1 to the 720x1600 Nokia G20 is restricting the screen area.  I knew that I will be making this compromise because of my other choices.For many years now I have been used to the fingerprint scanner on the back and it took a little bit of time to get used to the one on the right largely used with the thumb,In my earlier phone, the VI connection was almost always absent while the Airtel connection was active through the WiFi calling option and VoLTE enablement. I was surprised to find that in the new phone both the sims supported WiFi calling and VoLTE. So my VI connection now has better connectivity in the new phone at my location.Earlier when I read about the Mediatek G35 chipset I noticed that the chipset supported only a 13MP +13MP or 25MP camera and I was wondering how could it support a 64MP camera. Taking pictures I have figured out that the phone normally takes 4000*3000 pixels or 12 MP photos with 1.60-micrometer pixel size.  My Nokia 6.1 had Zeiss 16 MP camera with 1.0-micrometer pixel size and this was again a compromise. I will retain my Nokia 6.1 if I really need to take 16 MP pictures. It is possible to take a 48MP pixels picture using 0.8-micrometer pixels. At this low pixel size, image quality is expected to be poor because of the smaller pixel size and the interference between the adjacent pixels. When 12 MP photos are taken four 0.8-micrometer pixels join together through a process known as pixel-binning to function as a single 1.6-micrometer pixel.I have now been having this phone only for the last 3 days and my impression of the phone is based on what I have read and observed. I don't think I will be able to use this phone for full 3 years as I have used my Nokia 6.1. Whenever my service providers start supporting 5G at that time I will have to replace this phone with a 5G phone from Nokia. Till then this is a good cheap phone with some compromises because of my need for monthly security patches on an Android 11.I am satisfied with the new Nokia G20 as it meets my needs. I don't think I will run out of storage very soon as new pictures will only be 12MP and not 48MP about which I was concerned earlier."
5,"I bought this mobile for my parents, and their major use is WhatsApp, some social networks, commuting and banking apps. And they look for a phone which has a good battery backup, large screen and decent performance. G20 is a right fit for them. Build quality is sturdy. Go for it if you are not looking for a phone for gaming etc.,"
2,"Nokia G 20 has randomly restart issue for every 2-3 hours on my brand new mobile. Approached Nokia customer care and they couldn't resolve the issue. Worried on this purchase. Requested for replacement.I am loyal customer for Nokia, never faced this sort of issue ever before."

5,Its the best phone I purchased for my mom . Work really well and fast thank you amazon for the fast delivery .
5,Good product with this budget. 12499/-
5,"Right now I am using Nokia 7.1.I just loved it. I am gonna purchase G20. Go for it. Nokia the name you can trust. Number doens't matter, performance matters the most. I am satisfied with my mobile even after 2 years."
5,"For the price it's more than your monies worth, especially if you see the prices of some other brands in the same category. Working well, nicely designed and what else does one want? Go for it."
4,"Writing this rivew after 1 day use. If you're looking for desi mobile like avoid China wala phone then nokia is great option for you. When you start your phone very first time you love the sound of nokia with welcome screen, phone will take an update of 276 MB which will take half hour for setup. Design is good but expecting some basic features like basic headphones in pack, notification light missing, some times proximity sensor not working properly i.e when you talk on your phone and place your phone on ear, screen's light automatically goes off, some time it feels lag while using frequently camera or any application. Battery and camera is good at this price. I think battery will go for 2 days. As I mentioned above little lag issue which I have faced it's not good for gamers. If you are a basic user or wanna gift this stuff to your parents and grandparents go for it, ha Nokia ringtone lagana na bhule you will love that sound."
1,"I am changing this review, because, accidentally, when I tried zooming while capturing a video, I was able to see some of the grains. I have scheduled a technician visit. Will update once the issue is solved. Hopefully, I will be able to return the phone"
1,"The main reason I bought this phone is that I heard that Nokia provides regular MONTHLY security updates. But today is 2nd November, 2021 but still have not received October,2021 security update. If Nokia can't provide regular security updates then there is no point to buy Nokia smartphones.Update: I have recieved the October 2021 security update on 5th November 2021. This is not expected from a Android one phone. October update should be delivered by October only. There are many other phone manufacturer in market who sell phones cheaper than Nokia, only advantage of Nokia is their andoid phones are all android one phones and any one wants regular updates would want to buy it. But if Nokia also can't provide security update on time then there is no advantage for Nokia and current Nokia owners will buy another brand phone next time."
1,"Read carefullyIf you use smartphone 3-4 years then it's same like this..Speed is almost same of 3 years old technology phone.Build quality is ok but processor is almost dead.Think twice if you wanna purchase itHonestly says don't buy this handset.I know that Amazon can't post this review,they want to sell this and make our fool"
4,"I have always used Nokia phones from school days itself.  I still have a Nokia lumina 730 and a Nokia X phone at home both of them still works fine. When I went through the spec sheet of g20 there is nothing much to brag about. But I have been using it for a while now. It works beautifully for sending mails, zoom meetings and occasional social media. The phone has excellent call quality.  Also pure android interface is clutter free. Looks premium and solid to hold. The package was slightly damaged and unlike older Nokia phones there is no tamper proof seal. HMD has to definitely improve on that part. Phone camera has great output in average lighting conditions. I bought it for data security and the bloat ware free OS. EXCELLENT PHONE FOR THE PRICE. Yes you will get Chinese brands with better specs. But this one meets my purpose."
4,"The phone is simple and safe. OS update for two years and safety update for three years are added advantages. No heating problem even after watching movies and web series for hours. No pre-installed un-necessary apps. Good battery life. 1.5 days even after watching web series is not a problem. Compromises are display quality, camera quality and slow processor. However, if you are not high end game player to than the slow speed is not a problem. You can have a high end DSLR for photography. No mobile can compete with a DSLR. But the phone has very typical problems. Taking screen shot is a pain. Going back to the previous web page, especially in Facebook is not possible. These problems are surprisingly there in the phone."
4,Got this phone after my 6.1 and wanted a bargain.Biggest pro is good hardware equal to QC 665 chipset at a low price. Nokia build quality and good cameras and clear loud sound. The main camera has a good night mode which was a surprise. You don't need to charge everyday.Screen guard and good quality silicon cover included.Cons here it is bit heavy. The stock Android 11 is very new and I seen few apps just closing. No back button so need to use gestures. Hopefully the software will improve. The phone takes noticibly longer to start. Frame is ok plastic build.Update after 2 weeks: good performance but noticed the phone did not restart normally onfew occasions. The new Android seems to be very buggy.
1,Missing headset
5,All time Nokia performance üíØ/üíØ& Nokia G20 Excellent
1,Bug with 5ghz wifi
2,"UPDATE - Review after using for a month:Pros:Look and design are fantasticStock android gives an ad free experienceComes with pre-installed screen guard along with a transparent protective caseCons:Fingerprint sensor is not consistent. Sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Disappointed with thisTouch response is slowReally tough to switch between apps during callsSlow in response when trying to view media with more than 500 filesSlow in response while unlockingWhen you are in a call and if you need to use any app, it becomes really tough to switch as the phone does not respondTaking lot of time while opening applicationsOverall, performance should have much  better for this price. Would not recommend this to others"
1,"Very poor performance and you can not return it. You have to live what you get. It can only be replaced only if their technician visits you and Mark it as a problem which certainly does not happen. Moreover even if you get a replacement, it will be of not use. The device performance is very poor. Not sure how one can give it a 5 star? Not expected from brand like Nokia and a very poor customer support from Amazon."
1,"Worst phone I had ever used. Such a poor product from Nokia. Not at all worth buying.Too slow, functions are not proper, you cannot create multiple copies of whatsapp if you are using dual simColor combination is not proper. Other phones in this category are getting are far better.Takes a lot of time to recharge"
4,"Phone is ok but screen is very lengthy, it's not looking good"
5,"The phone is well built, looks smart and works well. This phone is ideal for those who want clean android on a limited budget, and those who don't play demanding games. The camera is decent, there is a big battery, a 3.5 mm audio jack and a fast fingerprint reader. Those who want similarly clean android but with a better processor may go for a pixel device."
1,Worst cam quality and  touch was not working properly waste of money.don't buy this mobile plz.even one star rating also waste for this mobile.
2,"Disappointed with nokia. Dont recommend.Sluggish processor performance that is visible in normal usage. I dont think it will support heavy games.Basic shortcuts missing, you have to dig deep to reach them.Fingerprint sensor refuses to respond many times and face lock works according to its wish.Poor camera interms of performance, no image stabilization. Images will be blurry if you dont keep your hand steady.Only satisfactory thing about this phone is battery life. But at this price it is not even close to redmi phones under 8k.Nokia has lost its quality and trust.I regret buying this phone."
5,"I love the Blue colour but Nokia G20 with Dark Blue is awesome and I bet everyone will love this colour. I got this product yesterday, will update about the same after using it for few days."
1,The Phone's performance is very bad. Don't buy it. I am regretting.
3,Better go to nokia 5.4 compare to G20.
3,"I always like phones without any adware and bloatware and Nokia phones are perfect for that.Nokia G20 also is good on that front.Battery life is very good.Camera performance is good.I like Fingerprint reader also on the side.Performance could be better as it gets sluggish sometimes, so better optimization is required.So in all its a good phone."
5,"48mp camera really good, macro 2mp super, great battery backup, value of money."
5,"Excellent phone and value for money. In day light ,camera is awesome. Battery life is very good. OS is neat and clean. Better buy in this price range."
4,"NOKIA G20 is a simple smartphone devoid of any sophisticated features ideal for the needs of a normal user. Its  build quality is good, has a decent battery back up, fairly large screen, and decent performance too. Ideal phone for Senior Citizens too who wishes to migrate from a feature phone to smartphone. The disappointing feature is the lack of screen switches to reverse or retract the pages if swiping fails.  The finger print sensor could have been placed at the back rather than at the edge. Design of the SIM tray needs enhancement. I would give it a 3.5 stars rating."
3,"I got this phone, as I did not want to buy a Chinese phone. The only options were Nokia, LG, Samsung.Using this phone for month now, and this is a below average phone.PROS:Camera: The picture quality is good at this price point, it has night mode. Photos are crisp and clear.Battery: It lasts for 1.5 to 2 days. However, I am not a gamer or heavy phone user.Screen: The adaptive brightness is not very responsive, however screen is fine.CONS:Pretty much everything else:Finger print sensor: Its on power button, this takes away the feature where you can scroll down and see notifications tray. Also the sensor keeps on reading the fingerprint when the phone is in pocket. This results in phone getting locked. You will have to enter passcode very frequently.Processor: This is very old and slow, it hangs very frequently. resulting in phone restarts.Responsiveness of phone: This might be related to processor, but the phone gets frozen too many times.Overall a very outdated and below average phone. Nokia need to ramp up a lot to compete with Chinease phones."
4,"I'm giving 1 star less for quality control issues on Nokia's part. I received a defective unit at first which had camera issues. The replacement process is a huge headache - Amazon first requests a technician to inspect your device who never turns up and makes excuses when he calls you at the end of the day, then you have to talk to customer care who offers replacement (which could have been done at the first place).Overall it's a decent phone; fairly good camera, battery easily lasts for 1.5 days with normal usage, and stock android which means 0 ads and bloatware. The only thing that needs work is quality check in manufacturing: Nokia shouldn't be letting out defective pieces at the first place, so that customers don't have to deal with the tedious replacement process."
4,"Stock android.. without annoying third party apps..neat..good pics, fast enough... connectivity for network is fast and good..better than most phones..after all mobile connectivity is the foremost requirement  for a mobile and NOKIA knows it better a big negative point IT HAS ARABIC LANGUAGE BY DEFAULT IN THE BOTTOM SEARCH OPTIONS..NO HINDU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT AS A DEFAULT LANGUAGE IN INDIA.."
5,This product is really worth it...loved it using this mobile
5,Nice device except performance day today task easily handle if u like good looking device go for it software experience is excellent
2,"This is seriously lacking features which you'd expect any modern phone to have.1. The power/data connection is still micro USB and not type-C,2. there's no fingerprint sensors to quickly open phone,3. no gesture support4. the android one which comes in the phone doesn't support android auto,5. It doesn't support 5 GHz wifi.6. has very low memory and cpu.Don't go for this just because of Nokia brand name. Nokia has destroyed it's reputation with offerings like this !!.Better go for Motorola phones coming in same price range."
5,"The phone is amazing and is perfect at this price. Perfect gift for your parents as the user interface is simple and operates smoothly. For the people giving negative reviews, I would like to say that this phone is perfect for using apps like whatsapp and other social media apps. It is not meant for heavy gaming according to it's specifications and price slab. Overall my Dad is happy with the phone and enjoys using it. Keep it up Nokia, it's now time to bring back your glory. The best thing is that it's Made and manufactured in India, even the charger and accessories are made in India. Proud to have an Indian product."
5,"It‚Äôs very good for study , for light gaming etc ‚Ä¶.looks is awesome, feels good in hand‚Ä¶.."
5,"Except camera it is better than galaxy A21s  which I was using previously,performance is super good,there is no boltware compared to samsung,it's  almost pure android stock phone .full charging gives 2 days .NOKIA  üëåüëåüëåüëå"
1,"Not good for this price range, was expecting more from nokia, specially camera and audio is worst"
5,Nokia is a reputed mobile brand. 3GB in 10000 rupees is good.
1,"Its Network is not good, although I have mobile booster installed at my place but still this phone disconnects a lot, although same sim on other phone same place works properly. waste of money..."
4,"Like this product but little overpriced ,, but ok üëç"
1,Toatl waste of money..no flash lightBad cameraNothing good
1,Maha ghatiya phone hai koi bhi mt kharidna
5,"Android 11 (Go edition) rocks on this phone. I had doubts regarding the 2GB RAM being too less, but the phone works smoothly and multitasking has no lag. Display quality is good.I would say this is an excellent phone for non-gamers.  I was proud to see that even the charger is Made in India.Downsides: The screen guard was not fixed properly and had air bubbles and some marks. I removed it and had to buy one separately. The audio loundness and shrillness does not match that of other popular brands in the market. But it is quite acceptable. Camera is good for the price.Overall 5 stars!"
5,"No frills device, smooth operation. Good for day to day use in this budget. Good battery performance. Good screen. Easy to handle."
5,6.5 inch screen is apt for my kids online classes and this device has huge 5000mAH battery which easily last for 1.5 to 2 days. I am impressed with HD+ screen and build quality which Nokia is offering.Impressive product.
5,2 days battery life under 10k segment is awesome and what a beautiful smartphone with dual camera setup in this range. Nokia never fails to impress with their phone's build quality.
4,"I got it as additional phone , but liking it very much so using it more than my other phone. Battery life is the star feature. I guess Nokia has started to live up to its past reputation. Value for money ."
5,I liked this device mostly for the screen size. Amazing video output in Zoom when the kids are having their online classes. Sound clarity is awesome.
1,No one is as fool to buy a 3GB 32GB varient in 10k when there is nothing special in camera or display and same specs phone from other brand comes up around 7 to 8K.
5,"This is a great value for money device! Nokia never fails to impress when it comes to design. Having a big screen and a 5000 mAh battery, the phone lasts easily for 1.5 to 2 days. Ideal for binge watching and online classes."
5,This is the perfect phone at this price. I love it. Nokia is launching very good phone with very good battery life.

4,"Battery life is superb, runs for 2 days smoothly. Camera quality are not very good but at this price range it's fair. Phone is heavy because of the battery. Screen is wide and great for watching videos. Sound and mic quality is moderate. Overall it's a great phone for people who have moderate usage. I bought this phone for my mom and she's very satisfied with it."
4,They should add fingure print reader feature as well. Camera should be better.

1,As per this price range it is absolute pathetic quality of front and rear camera...after going through review video I had purchased this phone ...but it is absolutely one of the biggest mistake.Camera quality is just like 10000 to 15000 rs range.it is totally not worth the money of 26000 rs.
4,"Using for a day. So far all Good. Back side Diamond  finish great. Material also Good.  Camera - Good, bright picture. Rich in color may be corrected. Display Good. Operating Good. Charging okay. Not so fast. Can be improved. Overall a Good  phone value for money . Request to bring it to 20K range to be Good seller . Thanks for a Good product. Being phone is very light it slightly vibrate on playing Loud music.  Will update soon."
5,"11 Lite NE 5G coming under xiaomi is truly an awesome and premium phone. It's the lightest phone I've ever used and the features are no less than any other phone. The 50+ director modes, dolby display, 10 bit amoled display and 90hz refresh rate makes this phone more special. The battery life is also pretty good."
1,"1. Storage becomes inaccessible after disabling work profile for all apps in personal profile.2. Work profile button on notification bar doesn't light up or grey out.3. You cannot pic calls if something is running picture in picture, the caller notif will slide up and down like an animation but call cannot be picked up.4. Disabling work profile disables application running in dual mode as well.5. DnD does not disable notifications nor silence calls6. Pictures/screenshot will not be stored because storage is inaccessible7. Also, if you raise an issue, the technician will take bribe to let you replace the product.8. Customer support is pathetic, they won't let you return the product, continue with there useless support call."
1,1. Not value for money.2.Camera not worth for 28k range3. MIUi is worst. I was not able to remove control center toggles.SUGGESTION: DON'T BUY
5,"For under Rs 27,000 people are expecting the same value they would receive from Rs 1 Lakh+ iPhone 13 Pro Max.Granted most of the reviewers on YouTube were overtly heaping praises on this phone (mostly paid by Xiaomi to do so). Probably that's the reason many of you were disappointed by this phone when you finally got it in your hands.Think of this phone as iPhone SE of the Android world and you will understand the true value for money of this phone.Pros:1) 21 4G LTE bands, no one gives so many LTE bands on a mid-range phone. NO ONE. Not even Xiaomi did this before. This is probably the first time Xiaomi is so generous on the LTE bands, I hope they continue this trend. This allows us to use the phone almost anywhere in the world while traveling. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who travels to different countries without worrying if their phone will work or not.2) 12 5G bands, good to have. Makes the phone future proof. But do consider Indian operators haven't chosen the bands yet. So we still don't know the 5G bands working in India in the future.3) 3 years of Androids updates and 4 years of security updates. My second reason to get this phone after the LTE bands.4) Overall performance is smooth and without any hiccups. Some may not like MIUI. But I am happy with it, they don't have bloatware anymore and even most system apps can be deleted.5) The feel of the phone in hand is amazing. I don't like my phone to run my life, I want to use my phone as a slave and only use it when i need it. Since this phone is thin and light you can easily fit in your pocket and forget about it.6) Incredible screen: the 10-bit AMOLED screen is just amazing for watching Netflix.7) Camera: It seems that many are complaining about the camera. I don't understand why. It's really good and I did not find any issues with it.Cons:1) If you keep the screen at 90hz the phone will heat up. I don't mind 60hz but to many this could be a deal breaker. Again think of this phone as iphone SE of the android world.2) Warming issues: There is a weird warming issue. NOT HEATING but warming. I don't know what tasks warms it up, its very erratic. Same task or app next time might not warm the phone. It's weird. After the latest security update it has seemed to stop.3) Xiaomi paid too much to YouTube reviewers unnecessarily hyping up the phone unrealistically instead of showing true value and use case of the phone. This phone is NOT PERFECT. But close to getting all your job done without any problems, a really well done phone for this price point.Recommended for- Travelers, because of the generous LTE bands this would be a best phone for the globetrotters.- someone who needs Long battery life, I got about 7 hours of screen on time on heavy usage (Camera, social media, work, maps, netflix everything minus gaming).- anyone who wants to feel secure because of the software updates.- Netflix viewers, this phone would be a perfect treat for you.NOT Recommended for- Uber drivers, food delivery guys or anyone working under the sun for too long. The warming issues might cause a problem.- Gamers. The phone can handle games but because of the warming issues gamers might not have the best experience.- Anyone who wants fast refresh rate screen. This phone supports 90hz but it heats up at that rate.. You need to use the phone at 60hz to avoid heating.Overall this phone can be very good for value for many especially travelers, if you watch a lot of netflix and someone who works on the phone a lot. Xiaomi took some really good steps in the right direction with generous LTE bands and updates.Almost all YouTube reviewers ruined this phone for many with their greed for money. For example this phone comes with wifi 5 and a plastic back. Many Youtube reviewers falsely claim that it comes with wifi 6 and glass back. Even the most famous so called trusted ones.Edit: Switching off auto brightness seems to be solving the warming issues."

1,Not worth for the price. Camera is worst
1,Battery draining too fast in day 2 day usage
4,"Light weight, slim and lends a premium look & feel due to its glass gradient back. Back camera struggles in low light condition. Macro shots are eye pleasing. Selfie camera takes decent photos. For my kind of usage, battery lasts for more than one day with 90 hz refresh rate. Coming from ColorOs, MUI 12 is a new experience for me but I did not like it. Did not notice any lag or stutter while using this device.For users who are not addicted to intensive gaming, they can happily coexist with this device for their day to day usage and yet own a premium segment all rounder."
5,Nice display n cam and in last 5g 12 band outstanding coverage go for it buys
4,The phone is good with amazing  specs But the MIUI is very buggy eg many PDFs don't open from many apps
4,"ProsGreat display90hz works very effectivelyGood stereo speakersGood build quality , looks premiumPerformance and response is very snappyConsCamera struggles in low lightingBattery capacity is low but as compensation we got fast chargingGiving 4 stars as no device is perfect"
4,I'm happy value for money üòç
5,"The first look of the phone made me remember my iPhone 6 which is slim rest have to use it for further review yet if your are looking for a multitasking phone with good quality camera and little gaming with full 1 day battery this is your phone got it for 23499 ( 6 gb 128 ram) during Amazon offer oct 2021 using amazing offers by Amazon,most important for me is xiomi dosent lower the price to a extent where it hurts the first buyer, comes with charger, cable and a transperent case so no spend on accessories, if u still want they are comparatively cheaper and pocket frendly most important xiomi has a service centre at most of the district head quaters across India no in case of any issues"
5,"It's a mid premium smartphone and it's so light and slim. The phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G which is good and  you pretty decent performance for the price.The display is 10bit 90Hz Amoled and it also have Dolby Vision , the HDR content on Netflix are so good to watch with Dolby Vision.It also have stereo speakers, a plus point here compared Realme GT ME which doesn't have stereo speakers and also no HDR support for Netflix.It have a triple camera setup it's okish not so great not so bad. It have a decent camera. The telephoto macro camera is awesome and allows you to take great macro shots.The battery life is also Good ,as this is slim phone the capacity is 4250mAh it takes through a day with normal usage , and also comes with 33W charger.The networking and WiFi performance is also good and also have carrier aggregation.The MIUI is surprisingly smooth will optimized on this phone and Xiaomi has promised 3 years Major Android update and 4 years of security updatesThe phone is may not look value for money like other phones in the market as this phone is a new segment target different consumer. The introductory price with Amazon offer was a great deal though.It feels light, looks good and gives a reliable performance.  The phone is also future proof for 5G with 12 Bands."
5,"Got this instead of GT master in sale.Pros : -SlimGood Looking (Diamond Dazzle)Clear and loud Sound {Vibrates on more levels though}Good cellular receptionMore 5g Bands- Future proofingVery good wifi coverageInbuilt Camera features like vlog mode and othersI don't game ,using it for regular office and daily tasks only. So This gets me around 9 hours + backup which I believe is very good as I have to charge it next day morning or late night.Cons :1.Flashlight is okayish can't be used as a torch, even old samsung has better coverage2. Camera is good but I feel front camera could have been betterWill add if find any other cons.."
3,"I didn't feel much difference when compared with my previous MI note 5 pro usage. Only reason for my purchase was that this phone has 5G and lite weight and it has served the purpose. Lite weight, Yes. Can't say about 5G right now..Plus, I being a prime member feel cheated for buying the phone very early in the sale. I got a discount of ‚Çπ 1500 on exchange which if bought now (without prime membership I suppose)would have got ‚Çπ 3500 discount on exchange..... Sad but true..... What's the message for #primemembers by doing this?"
5,"Using this phone almost 5 days now.Sharing this review so that you can decide if you want this phone Or not.Display: beautiful screen edge to edge display great visibility on screen. 4k videos are looking beautiful in this screen.Camera: lots of feature in camera. You can record 4k videos upto 30fps. Good camera setup.Processor: 778G I must say great performance I played BGMI, Carx rally, COD, Real racing3. These are the games with good graphics and believe me there is no lag while playing these games.Battery: Nice battery backup depends on your usage. Fast charging is good.Design: lite weight and sleek design amazing looks.If you are looking for a phone for design, camera, performance. GO FOR IT.BUT BUY 128/8"
5,Got this phone on great indian sale with my old phone exchange... Must say worth it... Build quality good... Camera is descent.. And it has got 35W fast charging...
3,"Use it n then I promise you will not regret. Thanks to MIUI 12.5, AND Andriod 11, also chipset 778 is highly optimised to enhance the experience."

4,"There are few bugs i face from starting, they might be fixed after updates1. sometimes fingerprint not work properly i have to touch multiple times to open it2. Battery drains little bit faster, but it has fast charging support so there is no issue with it3. About screen, i downloaded few 4k videos to check screen quality and i noticed major frame drops during playback in some videos (like nature videos)3. Except these 2 problems everything was best, no complaints about any other things, i hope they will fix this with updates"
5,"Good Mobile with descent battery and camera, can play bgmi games without any hurdle. 4g+ carrier i am getting on both sim, fast, no hang issue till time.Battery last for 1 day, full charging does in 50mins ... Charging speed is good, no heating issue while playing games or watching videos, Bluetooth connectivity is also good with tws."
5,Phone quality good .other features also good.lekin ek hi drawback hai.CAMARA:IF YOU CLICK PHOTOS FAST IT WILL CAPTURE BLURRY PHOTOS.WAIT FOR FEW SECONDS AND THAN CLICK IT WILL CAPTURE GOOD PHOTOS.XIAOME NEEDS TO IMPROVE CAMARA QUALITY IN SOFTWERE UPDATE
4,"Model Bought:- Jazz/Bubble gum Blue, 8 GB RamNote: If you are a gamer, this phone is not for you.Pros:This phone was a steal deal during Amazon Grand Festival sale for 25,500/- for those who were looking for budget premium mid range phones.The sleek and super light body with Jazz blue color will make you instantly fall in love as soon as you will hold it.I have seen on youtube that reviewers are praising Diamond Dazzle and Tuscony coral colors only, but I would say that this blue color is underrated. It looks awesome as well.Phone has great display(to be honest, I have compared it with OnePlus 8 Pro) and good camera(actually unexpectedly impressive during night).Combination of SD 778G and 8 GB ram will handle all your day to day task pretty smoothly, so you can load your phone with all kinds of apps. Let me just say that you don't have to worry about any lags here at all.Battery and charging speed are also good. My phone is easily lasting more than one day with medium to heavy usage. And if you are a fan boy of ultra superfast dart charging speed then you might find it slow otherwise I would consider it a decent charging speed(takes a little more than an hour for full charge).I see some users have raised heating issue which I find surprising as I am a heavy gamer and phone tester and I haven't encountered such problem while using the phone. It gets a little warm during prolonged usage(which is expected and acceptable). I have experienced hot body temperature only when I was charging my phone and playing games simultaneously(which is anyway not recommended at all)As this phone is having MIUI 12.5, obviously you would get a lot of customization option. Xiomi phones also include a lot of small but very useful features in-built like memory cleaner, second space and many more which are good to have.I would like to highlight one thing here that if you have heard about Super Wallpapers in MIUI,  those are not available! I hope it gets released with the MIUI 13.Lastly, for gamers, you will be disappointed. The phone is having a powerful processor-ram combo and and a good GPU as well, but I think the software needs a lot of attention. Surprisingly it handles intensive games like FreeFire and Genshin Impact prettly well(you will see some frame drops in between but those are very less and ok - won't impact you gaming) , but fails to perform while playing average games like Clash Royale and Angry Birds Transformers, it stutters a lot like a cheap 5-10k phone even though I was playing them in Game Turbo mode :(Summary:The only reason I have given it 4 stars and not 5 is because of  dull gaming experience. Otherwise, if you are a fan of light weight and slim phones which is powerful and premium looking as well and under 30k, this is probably the best choice for you."
5,Xiaomi 11 lite NE 5G. A great premium midrange device with gorgeous look powered by an extraordinary piece of hardware engineered to perfection along with cool and customizable software with assured Android and Security updates. Well done Xiaomi....
4,"The phone is almost an amazing device. I used it over a week days to review full..Display- Top notch, good crisp colour with vivid video experience. 10 bit display is amazing when you see movies or ott content.Looks- Killer looks with both side glass, back is not slippy. White and blue colour suits well.Processor- All new SD 778G runs apps, games(haven't tested hard) , videos etc like butter smooth.Battery- Works a day for me with over 6hr 30 min sot.Bundled 33w charger charged it over 1hr.Camera- Macro shot is justsuperb. It has many photo and video modes and clicks almost decent pics.Audio- Dual speaker does good work. Sound is loud and clear and even better in headphones.Call quality and reception isgood. It comes with built in NFC.Miui 12.5 is out of the box which has many features. Though it has many bugs like colur haziness, sloppy dark mode, mi keypad also glitches , app shutdown, proximity sensor problem, sudden frame drops etc. Let's hope when update comes.However Amazon's sellingpolicy of this phone is verybad. Exchange value andOther bank offers should be fixed in festive time. I almostloss 4k as after buying thisphone the price slashed onAmazon.4 star for this phone and 2star for Amazon shopping experience."
4,Product is decent. But what advantage prime members got from Amazon? Almost prime members lost ‚Çπ1000 on earlier access purchase. Is it correct? Amazon has to refund excess amount collected from prime members on par with non-prime members to justify good business ethics.
5,"Overall, the display quality is top notch. Fingerprint sensor is blazing fast. Phone charges quickly with 33W fast charger. Best mid-range phone in the Indian market right now."
5,"The best part is, it is so light. Never knew how much I hated bulky phones.Truly the most competent and feature-rich phone in this segment."
1,"Hell!! Lots of software & hardware issues...!!!1) I'm not able to open it when I try to open it with my passwords. Disgusting thing!! Might be a touch issue or something don't know.2) The phone is heating while charging and after using 15-20mins itself. The battery also draining like anything.3) While playing BGMI, mobile is heating like anything.4) The headphone connector jack quality is the worst...5) In dark theme black colour keyboard changes to light brown colour!!6) An automatic Call recording option is not available!!7) While using a keyboard, I felt there is a touch delay or touch problem!!8) As they said charging is not too fast!!9) With this price range, plastic bumps are not so good. Mobile is lightweight but MI definitely compromise the build quality.10) camera is not what we expected in this price range.11) Replacement options are not available and returning the amount to Amazon pay is not worth it at all (still not sure about the return and replacement policy)Very irritating Fedup of these all..."
3,"Phone is light weight and takes time to get used to MIUI interface (this being my first mi phone). Battery back up is good and charges 100% in less than an hour. No 3.5mm jack is a disappointment and makes life difficult to use the converter and headphones. BEWARE!!! After the festive season sales, the price got reduced by 1k further after exchange and all bank discounts. Don't fall for marketing gimmicks"
4,A perfect combination of  Technology with smartness. very handy phone with all the required specifications  needed for a daily use. Nice colors. good sound output touch is good .
3,"Writing this review after 7 days of use...Camera quality is pathetic, just like 10000 to 12000 RS range.  No option to capture pics with Side Mounted fingerprint scanner  Camera Lovers, don't go for it...Battery back up is up to 7 hrs only.Loud speaker quality is no that much good. No bass effectUnable to record sound using Screen Recorder(Zoom Calls).Contacts: No option to see how many contacts we haveScreen not turning off during the call and this is inconvenientNot worth the money of Rs. 29000/-Good DesignGood DisplayNo issues with Amazon delivery"
5,I liked this phone very muchPros1. good camera2. super display3. super speaker4. super built qualityoverall super packageConsMiui bugsPrice
2,"So long story short, I purchased this phone and the unit I received had a display panel issue known as ""black crush"", I was very disappointed that a Phone that's having its Display Panel as it's USP is having this issue.So I applied for a replacement, and after many painstaking days of follow-up with Amazon I got my replacement.But to my disappointment the replacement phone also has a weird panel issue, wherein, in low brightness you can see faint black lines running down the panel.But now I'm tired of applying for replacements and I don't know if the replacement would have an another major defect bigger than this one.So my verdict for this phone would be is that Xiaomi's build quality is becoming more and more questionable these days as they keep on churning out more mobiles than a rat has babies each year.I don't think my next phone would be a Xiaomi."
4,"Pros:1. Lightweight and well-balanced. Looks premium.2. Reasonably sized camera bump.3. Good bright screen. No problem in usage outside in day time.4. Decent battery. I got 24 hours standby time with 5 hours screen on time. Good enough for a typical day usage.5. Both side fingerprint scanner and the face unlock work nicely. There is no delay or missed authentication.6. Cell signal and WiFi signal reception is pretty good. Call quality is exceptionally good.Neutral:1. Decent camera. Color reproduction is good but images start pixelating soon if try to zoom in. Feels like Xiaomi is compressing the images too much during post-processing.2. No 3.5 mm jack but has usb-c to 3.5 mm adapter bundled in-box. It works nicely.Cons:1. The UI is laggy and animations are jittery. It's still very much usable but should be much better on a phone costing 28000.UPDATE- The UI has improved significantly after recent update.2. No gestures on third party launchers. All because Xiaomi does not want to improve its implementation of the system-wide gestures on MIUI.3. Dolby Vision is just a gimmick. All HDR checking apps along with Netflix will tell you that it supports Dolby Vision. But 778G processor does not support hardware decoding of Dolby Vision content. You can check this by trying to play any Dolby Vision demo video after downloading. MX player will try to play using software decoding but it's not watchable.4. Any 4k 60fps HDR video stutters and there is a lot of skipped frames and audio/video sync issues (check on YouTube for 4k 60fps HDR videos). This processor should be able to play this. So, again MIUI has tried to overoptimize something and broken simple things in the process."
5,Pretty slim and fast
1,Dont buy this it is not worth for money. It is working slow
5,Pros:-1. Display (Best display you can get at this price i.e.  Super Amoled with 90Hz Refresh Rate2. üîã Battery (6000 mAh big battery)3. Camera ( 64 mp) and selfie (20 mp) and if you  know you know samsung image processing  software.4. Looks and back Design ( Awesome Pattern with  rainbow üåà reflection.)5. Compact Size (6.4inches) not too big and not  too small.......handy..Cons:-1. Processor (mediatek helio g80) which is a low  end processor and it might not affect your  overall performance if you are not a heavy  gamer or something like that.2. Infinity U display. Nowadays drop notch display  is kinda outdated look since overall look of the  phone is great but this small thing is like a black  spot on a white chart paper.##But Also keep that in Mind how can you get  everything in just 14999 -17999 ........in mid  range...these specs are perfect and at last you  can trust the brand name too.üòè
4,Cons:1.Good phone at this price.2.Display Quality is really great. Looks premium3.Camera is also very nice in daylight. In indoor it takes some shacky images.4. For Normal use I think it is best phone considering Samsung √Ämoled display and security.CONS:1. Could have been better if it comes with strong processor2. Samsung should have provided a Back case3. This phones support 25w charger but only 15w charger is provided so there must be 25w charger in the box
4,"I am sure there will be many reviewers who will do an in-depth analysis and list out the pros and cons of the device. So here i am pointing out the negatives that i felt . First thing first, the ring volume is mediocre. Ring is not at all loud and i wondee whether I have recieved a faulty device.Second thing i loathe is that, the back cover is a fingerprint magnet. Some kind of resin or composite material is used.To be honest, i didn't like the phone much. The design is outdated and sub par a 10k phone. Since bought this for an elderly person, the ring volume was a total bummer for me. Thats it, another useless review from me."
1,"I purchased this phone on 16999 from Amazon by exchange .but I did not find any quality as per this high price.1. Phone touchscreen is very slow and sometimes hangs stop working.2 while viewing YouTube the voice is not coming clear sometimes voice going up and down ,  microphone and speaker of this phone is not up to the mark even I should say worst. Of its kind.3 this phone is marketed as 6 gb ram but most of the phone memory is already approx 3 gb is occupied by pre-installed app which you can not remove. This is complete cheating with customer regarding storage.4.in whatsapp I am unable to select the more  photos. Its processor is very slow.even slower than  my previous phone .Do not waste the money on the premium phone like these.Better go for any other company"
1,"This phone is not different then other Samsung phone.  Yeh log but be cheater hai , kuch bhi change nhi . 31 ka 32 fir krenge 33 . Battery utni bilkul nhi jitna Shor mcha rhe hai. Service ek dam ghatiya. Pause Jeb me darkness ke baad uchi deewaar par Chad jaate hai. Please don't  buy Samsung Mobiles more. Ab ye vo people wali companies nhi rhi."
1,"Big major charging issue, charging icon is seen during charging but charging is not increased, that's a very bad or not exceptable by samsungConclusion- company target is money making not making a quality device üò°Now my money is loss and we are crying üò≠üíîüò¢"
1,"Believe me, it's the slowest mobile I saw. Don't go on screen and Battery, it is an extremely slow mobile phone and takes ages to open and navigate. Forget about heavy use, it can't handle normal regular use. I made a huge mistake but pls don't buy this mobile. It's only a few months and I am thinking to change it. Its dam SLOW SLOW SLOW."
1,"So greatful to Amazon for sending me such a nice product which has already landed in samsung service centre twice within one month of purchase, it was possible only when amazon refused to take back the product within the return period even though they've so called 'no questions asked' return policy.Above all Samsung did a great jod too by keeping the phone with themselves for 10 days now, sometimes I forget that I just bought a new phone because either it's not with me most of the times or it is sick.Lastly Amazon didn't even bother to reply back to my grievances.Hats off to you guys."
1,Samsung  is forcing the user to install all the junk applications  in our phone.even the Ota update installing the junks.Performce of the phone is pretty decent.Camera is also giving the good shots but the junk app spoiling the party.More than a samsung phone you are purchasing  bundle of junk applications
1,Worst camera. Seems like camera of local phone.  Returning this back.Too heavy. Don‚Äôt know why they are considering that 64 mp. Poor camera quality.
1,1. Heavy heat on both the sides. Front and back also.2. Charging is very slow.
1,Terrible phone. Always hang and unusable. Returning the product. Don't but this
5,"Processer is good.Both side Camera performance is good.Camera functions is work properly.In Screen look use face sacaner than fingerprint.Provide pre-installed apps Samsung system,  Microsoft system, Google system and Netflix's ,Amazon, etc.Charging capacity is too low, take 1¬Ω hr to charge.Fingerprint sacaner too small, many times its doesn't match.Lots of app pre-installed.25GB memory used out of 128."
3,"I'm a just a basic user of phones.  No movies, no games.  I mainly use phone, messages, photos, chats and other social apps and some utilities.  For the price, the features seem impressive and for my mild usage this phone sounds great.What I did not like is the amount of apps that were already installed on the phone!  Then I had to un-select a whole bunch of ""recommended"" apps during setup.  I was pre-subscribed to 'diagnostics' and 'recommendation' and 'marketing' notification by default!  Is that allowed?  Some features don't work unless I use specific apps.  Basically, they are app features and not phone features.  Sounds 'grey-area' to me.After spending half a day to go through all the settings and clean up the mess I think I'm ready to use this phone.  I still wonder what else I missed..."
1,Don't buy this mob... Camera performance is worse than 8k mob... Battery backup gives 1days.. On 60ghz..... 15k wasted.. No nfc...  Lost trust on Samsung.
5,My review after a week of usagepros-------*Battery - lasting for 2 days*Display - Great AMOLED display*Separate slot for memory card*Camera is also goodcons-------*Sometime touch is not working.*Battery - taking 3 hours to get fully charged. Nowadays we can get phone charged within 2 hours*Notification light is missing. Every time we need to on the button to check whether we have received any calls or messages*It is said that 15w charger but in adapter it says 10w (5.0 V = 2.0 A)*Too much of unwanted apps are pre-installed*Very outdated processor.
1,I am fully disappointed with this model.perfomance wise not good . Operating app is also slow taking so much time to open and download app .aslo taking so much time to charge after 40 % any mobile take 45 to 60 min to full charge but this mobile take around 90 to 120 min to charge.not worth it .not recommended to any one .
1,Battery Life is very poor .Even though it is 6000 mah battery it doesn't last a full day and needs to be charged atleast twice a dayEven though it is less than one month it's UI constantly stops and have to be closed.The response is extremely poor .I have been using One Plus 5 for the past 2 and half years and its response is better than this new device which is hanging and apps are crashing time and again .I had preferred an Indian phone to Chinese one but have been extremely disappointed with the performance of this phone
2,"I don't suggest to buy this m32 mobile, there is no extra features as they mentioned in their options, there they mentions atmos dolby sound, but third class sound in speakers and that option is not working, secondly palm swipe for screen shot is not working camera is so so, very bad product from samsung, I tried all the ways to take screen shots using palm swipe but I can't, if possible pls replace with another item mr amazon"
1,"This fraud incident happened to me. I bought Samsung Galaxy M32 smartphone on Friday 6th August 2021 online from Amazon and received it on Monday. As soon as I opened the This fraud incident happened to me. I bought Samsung Galaxy M32 smartphone on Friday 6th August 2021 online from Amazon and received it on Monday. As soon as I opened the parcel, I turned on the phone and found that it was defective.There is the issue of no display with this phone. The same day, I requested a replacement, the phone was to be replaced on 13th Aug 2021, delivery agent comes to my residence for replacement but refused to replace the faulty phone saying that the phone has no display and arguing that he requires to dial  *#06# on the defective phone to get  IMEI number for verification which he will feed on amazon's Software.But it is a well-known fact that on any cellular device like Smartphones IMEI no is printed on the phone, their box, and also on the receipt. I asked him to enter the IMEI number printed on the receipt but he refused. Again Iasked him to wait for few minutes and not to cancel the replacement I will talk to customer care to sort out this problem. But he did cancel the replacement. he might do it intentionally to grab the phonelater on Amazon Assured that the amount will be refunded, but to the date, no money has been transferred, i was contacted costumer care of Amazon  again on 13 August for pickup the defective cellphone samsung M32 ,on 14th August agent comes to my residenti and he also refuse to collect , makeing same excuse that you cell phone was ded so that's why I am not able to collect ....So dear those wo are going to buy any products  from Amazon be aware that Amazon team in india is making a Big Scam with their courier agent ...Please be safe and aware don't buy any product form Amazon .Dear readers. If you want to buy any products online use another online cart , like flipkart , Mintra, Mishu , but never from Amazon boycott Amazon ..."
5,"Amazing phone. I would rank it the best overall phone experience. The pros are obviously known to everyone, the 90hz display is great. The touch feel is literally like butter. Cameras are great. Amazon prime runs in HD so widewine l1 is there. Speakers are loud, not tinny but lack bass. Can't complain.Phone requires careful first time setup to avoid ads as suggested by ranjit sir. No ads encountered yet. Everything works well, side mounted power button /finger print reader is fast and accurate. Light sensor, proximity sensor are flawless. These 2 are typically bad in Chinese phones (mi note 5 pro user) causing display to turn on when in call, so thumbs up.The cons: the processor seemed weak on paper, but the experience is great. Not that I am defending samsung, but a compromise 90% can blindly make. I do not play games, so can't say much but better processor phones out there. This is for general public who wants smooth experience of samsung phone and no software bugs.Some complained of emmc5 storage, but apps installed damn fast and I did not find and sluggish read write speed issue. Fast and phone did not heat during setup process when installing 100s of apps and no slowness observed. I have 2 m30s in house, they also pointed out better build quality, better looks of my black version and fluidity of screen. Good for light gaming. Go ahead with the phone for good vibes throughout phones life. Now samsung is giving 3 years of software updates, so great."
1,"Display is good and bright. Battery  average. It's not that speed being 6gb ram, while making  call it lags. Camera not upto mark, I miss grand camera which was better  than 64 mp. Over priced, don't have basic features  of other M series phone. On the name of brand Samsung started cheating people.  They should  atleast  provide  cover."
3,"After purchasing Samsung M12, was looking forward to getting M31, but the mobile was not available and the prices increased. After waiting for a month, saw that M32 is available so purchased it but not entirely happy with it. The phone rings on its own at times, chimes continuously other times without any call or notification being given. Phone lags at time and opening apps also takes time. Perhaps the 6gb variant is better but I have 4gb model. OneUI was supposed to be stable and I am quite disappointed with this particular purchase at least."
1,"This is my first review of Any product purchsed online. I'm shopping online since ages now. But this Phone FORCED me to write a review.I've been Using Asus Zenfone phones till date for my usage, Had a wonderful experience....First time ever shifted to Samsung just because of so called Brand Name.WORST DECISION.Camera OK.Battery OK.Performance OK.Screen OK.Brightness OK.Within 1 week Lock switch stopped working.I'm locking and unlocking by screen tap option because samsung people have said it'll take time to repair.Body completely cheap plastic material.Heats up with normal usage.When in pocket automatically wakes up and starts typing numbers or dials emergency number.With No disregard to Samsung I'm saying very bad phone you've made.Very overpriced. Should be of 9k or less.Others opinions may differ from me. This is just my personal experience.I'm sorry to give you less stars Samsung but please improve your quality not quantity. There is no mandate to launch new phone every week."
4,Pros: Screen resolution is good. Speed and performance is ok ok. Sometimes got little sluggy during parallel execution. Camera is very good quality. Battery life is good. SW is really smooth. Speaker is louder enough. Finally it's not a Chinese brand.Cons: No 4k or HDR video viewing. So some videos are blurry even though it is HD. During charging phone gets heated up. Tats may be it has bigger battery. 5G support is not Der since most phones are now with 5G. Price might have been little less to compete Chinese brands.

2,"Best camera quality at 15k Not for gamers only for simple multimedia use and want a secure phone. Yes it lags too much on normal and heavy use .No carrier aggregation by samsung prosser support carrier aggregation only 3 thing is good about this phone camera,display and battery"
5,"Using since last three days ...completely satisfied with everything. In this segment so many phones are available but if i get the SAMSUNG then why i should go anywhere else...Pros:Display - SAMOLED with Full HD, Side Curves make you feel so happy. Brightness is awesome.Sound - Dolby Sound is also good specially with wired headphone.Battery - Without internet 2 days do not worry to charge it and with internet one full day.Call Quality : Also goodVideo Calling - BestCamera : Picture is so goodProcessor - Fast as it comes with 90Hz refresh rate.Cons:Notification LED Indicator is missing but can be managed.RAM could be 8 GB but if you choose the quality then it can be also ignored. 6GB also working fine.Verdict: If you are not a GAMER then blindly you can grab it."
5,"Value for money and best is 90hz super amoled display and 64mp quad camera. Best for listening music and watching videos as it has 6000mah battery goes 1+1/2 day ""but this phone is not for gaming"""
4,"best Non-Chinese smartphone preference under 15K | Excellent battery | Decent Camera | Smooth | Stylish look | Mummy Loved it ( I gifted it to her)Not made for chhapri youth icons of India.Not the best camera phone under 15K.for gaming under 15k > Motorola G40 / POCO is better option.if you are a decent user, who loves to watch videos/ browse social apps then definitely go for this.for Mumma/PAPA this would be best choice rather than Chinese smartphones.(Thumbs UP) BATTERY : Screen On Time > More than 13H for Mumma. she watches Jio Tv & browse social apps quite often.(Processor) MTK G80 doesn't lag much as compare to Exynos processors + it is better optimized for battery consumption. example Samsung M21 2021 with same 6k mAh battery with Exynos processor gives 7-9h Screen on time only, while Samsung m32 with same 6K mAh battery with MTK Processor gives more than 10-12H screen on time."
2,Waste of money. Don't but this phone. I'll not recommend it to anyone. Today I received  this and within 24 hours am reviewing  the product.  It's not worth . Camera is bad. MI is much much much better. I shud have listed to other reviews  before buying this.
2,"Seeing few YouTube videos,I purchase it,  It's 7-Days now.Processor is G80 , Which Don't support 90Hz& Don't support 2k Videos & Pics.,But, People who use for minimum usage like 2-3hr YouTube,  Amazon videos good.Most time it's 60hz , so, u feels Videos üìπlag ,When u take FHD pic it takes 2-4sec to save it.I am feeling M40 which I got 3-years back is much faster..So, Always go with Snapdragon processor.."
5,"The youtuber reviews will tell you that this phone doesn't have a powerful processor that others will offer you at this price range. It is a fantastic mobile for an average user like me. You should have to look what your purpose of the mobile you want purchase. If you want to play games like pubg and you want professional video/photoshoot this phone is not definitely not for you. It is good to watch youtube videos at high quality with samsung's amazing samoled screen, it can take some good photos and videos and can do some games even pubg at minimal settings.I thing like this people who drive  vehicle at a speed of 60 k.m per hour wants a car that have very powerful engine and they will never need that much power. Like that I don't need a very high performing processor and other features that I may not use.So think, if you are a person who only wants to use mobile for to make and take call and watch videos and occasionally wants to play some game, then this mobile is definitely for you.My job is some what risky and I need automatic call recorder to deal with my risky customers. This mobile has that feature. Its my purpose and that's why I bought this phone.Its a good phone an average customer."
5,"In love with this beast in reasonable price, camera quality is really great, screen resolution is far far clear and colour full, battery is strong, light weight, compact size, all required smart phone features are build in the phone. Good job Samsung team."
1,Do not buy. There are plenty of other good options for the price. Main issue is the PROCESSOR.  I just felt it's too slow compared to  the mobiles available.  Phone is also bit thick . And I think its manufacturing is stoped too.  It's only sold online. If I had a chance I would buy a different phone .
4,"Don't waste money on redmi or realme jst in sake for money. This phone is very nice for decent users. It is an all-rounder in all tasks, but for decemt usage. Camera is very nice than redmi, realme, oppo etc. Notch is very small and does not disturb. One UI 3.1 has tons of features to customize. My rating 8.5/10.All the Best!"
5,Great product. Bought it for display and battery.Cons...Processor is not powerful enough to draw 90hz. Battery is also drained so fast while use 90hz refresh rate.So I switched back to 60Hz. Performance improved and battery lasts longer than before.
1,"Received used old phone with viable scratches on front and back. When we turned on the phone, any phone will have only default apps. All additional apps are installed after we turn. But surprisingly all possible apps are installed in the phone. And once we returned it is taking forever to initiate the refund."
3,Battery life very baad saund very good price to hi on the offline
4,Product is good but they showing 16 gb it is not phon memory its phon supportable memory we aware frends before buy.....
4,"1. With single sim, phone lasts more than a 24Hrs with usage of 4-5 Hrs.2. When dual sim is used it lasts almost 5-6Hrs.3. When automatic call recording is enabled the voice is breaking intermittantly. so i disabled that feature. may be i can test it again and update the comments whether its because of memory card capacity/free space or some other issue."

4,"Hi, I am writing this review after 3 days of usage1. Firstly thanks to Amazon. Got delivered at a lightning speed. Ordered ok Saturday. Launch date was on 21st September and got delivered the same day at morning.2. Now about Oppo 17, this is very light weight, speed is good, I ordered dynamic orange. Trust me, this is the best and attractive colour I found ‡•§l, blue is a good option too if you don't like a funky coloir‡•§3. Camera I did not found upto the mark . Night mode is not that great but yes if you are a selfie person, go for it. I was using Ralme Xt earlier and it's camera was much better. But ok I will manage . I am a part time photographer and often I use my phone to click pics. Realme supported me a lot. Let's see how much Oppo supports.4. Speed is good. 6 GB 128 GB. Good combo. No lagging till now. Going smooth.5. Touch is awesome. Phone gets unlocks quickly. No lagging here too .Rest I will use for some more days and come back with my reviews again."
4,"This review's to all those who were eagerly waiting for the phone to launch and get hands on, but before all it's always hard to get the ""DEMO"" at the earliest so.. ""IMAGES"" above are to those who can't find demos much often/needed color/to avoid contacts at stores during Covid.Pros - Leather back warmth feelCons - Back Camera's not upto the mark when compared to the phones in market and of this price range, though it has given a sleek and leather finish with minimized thickness. . It's pro fades out its Con so can go for it blindly but only if you think ""CAMERA'S"" not your ""PRIORITY""Features I thought would be there was 9.1 surround music/Dolby Atmos but it comes with:Real Sound Technology, just have a look into it if you're specific2. Super Amoled+ Display.Hassle free(Inside the box):Tempered glass comes on the phone itself so no extra work on fixing, which might sometimes go wrong.2. Silicon back case (if you're looking for touch and feel of leather back, better not use.. but use a side bumper if available for protection) Do also post where we can find side bumper, cos it's hard finding for new phones.. Thanks!Looking for a Standout design in 15-20k range? Then, ""GO FOR IT"" that's Value for money!"
5,"i like the camera quality, images and videos are sharp and clear. there is a wee bit of noise in low light areas but it can be overlooked.it looks quite a bit like the iphone X but is largerdisplay is on par with iphone xmusic sounded as good as iphone xi could just unbox and get on with it as oppo provided the tempered glass, back cover as well. which was a pleasant surprise as I was not expecting. üòÑAlso the design, finger print sensor on display, face recognition .... lot of features.dual 4G standy by with an SD card is a blessing and I was looking for exactly what this phone offered at the right price and also the back cover made  of leather is so freaking rich and classy.quite happy with what I got. This is probably the fastest decision I have ever taken around buying a phone and I am hoping this will last long, like most of my other phones."
1,There is no inbuilt call recording&there is not inbuilt call block application without this why should we purchase oppo‡•§very bad experience with oppo now with this purchase
4,So it's been three days since I'm using this phone and I'm completely in love with it at the price I got.1. Weight of the Phone is very less when compared to any phone in this segment and this matters a lot to me while carrying or casual music listening or any stuff.2. Back leather type wrapper is really good and gives a premium feel.3. UI is also good in terms of usage and mobile handling and compatibility4. Camera is decent for video calls/ normal phots not that great especially for shotting long-distance objects/ sceneries. But this doesn't matter to me a lot. Come on use a professional camera if you want photography at peaks.5. Design is excellent and it is the slimmest phone at 7.43mm6. Build Material quality is good.7. Sound is good but not that great for melodies or any songs please use earphones/headphones.8. Display is really good and it's out of my expectation as I'm using Samsung AMOLED previously.9. Processor is fast for general purpose and played COD and some other games at medium graphics didn't observe any lag.10. Battery is okay and keeps you charged up for one day (General usage with low- medium gaming)11. Software is fast and no clutter apps or extra apps.Overall I would definitely recommend if someone wants a nice phone for general usage which looks classy.
1,Hi I got this phone 24 sept morning .phone is good and light weight so I love and purchased this.but this phone big point is it's not played videos like 4k videos and hd plus videos properly I can't understand this is which type of mistake is.oppo brand must solve this soon as soon possible. I also talk to Amazon customer care unit they arrange technical assistance he come 29sept  . Then let's see what type of problem is . I use before realms xt Samsung m21 and 31 they are best one chooses this for only of light weight and design ... Totally at that point disappointed ...hope to solve this problem ..........
5,"It's a nice phone overall ,I can see so many negative reviews.ProsLightweight ,fast charging , comes with screen protector and good headphonesColor OS is nice with update for color OS in the pipeline .Good battery backup and Samoled screen with 408 ppiCamera performance can be improved by installing Gcam modConsIt's a bit over priced but again given its aesthetics I would not mind the extra costOlder processor ,but still snappy thanks to the 6gb /8gb RamI had gifted the one for my mom and she absolutely loves this phone ,yes it resembles I phone x a bit ."
2,"It's not worth for this amount after Unboxing and using it for a moment I feels like that, because I am using oppo mobiles more than 3 yearsBut this product is okay by weightless,fast charging  but not okay with with cameras,finger print accessibility, battery performances,And processor is snap dragon 662 nothing more specific things .So oppo have to launch little bit better quality product for this amountDynamic orange üçä,first you realise the colour of orange and this phones colourDon't try to give fake colour or spread fake informationsSo I don't suggest to buy this product to anyone"
4,It is nice phone but it is little bit higher cost than expected in these segments
1,Quite disappointed with this handset. Although features are similar to other oppo series. The call recording option is horrible. Also the recoded mgs doesn't get stored in the device.
1,"it is the worst phone.bad soundvery slow finger print sensor,  laggingworst cameras .design is good, back cover is good , display is also very good."
1,very bad product...camera quality not well it only saying for megapixel but giving low quality images...fingerprint sensors not working as good and also when taking videos its lagging
3,"Nice phone. Finger print sensor sometimes doesn't respond when display is off. After keeping and removing the finger, it sensor light flows after 5 seconds and then fails to unlock.First thought it's an issue with my phone. Later saw one another reviewer mentioning the same here. Looks to be an issue that they can fix with software update.OK device."
1,"Very Bad performance, back camera is not good, picture quality is average, Hanging problem, automatic call recording features is not available, phone clock is slow, speakers sounds is not up to marks."
3,"updated review: dont go with this phone if you need to take some good quality photos!! below average camera quality!!original review: its a bit overpriced!!bought this mobile because i got it for 15k after  offers.overall a good phone with AVERAGE cameras, good AMOLED display and is handy.but i would not suggest this for 18k"
5,"just got the phone delivered today, amazing quick service by Amazon, i am using the phone since morning and did not find any lagging issue and down play, the phone is simply super and the design is one style statement. this phone is on edge for value for money.I would like to rate 5 star."
1,Over all this phone is just waste of money. Front camera results are not good. Also it's having issue in network while travelling. Earphone not working properly. Battery is not enough as described in ad. Look wise it is okay. But if you go for any other brand in this price you can get more.
2,I'm writing about this review after using phone one month earpiece was defective since bigning for that I sent replacement request but turned down and through balancancc app certified that product is ok Now finger print censor not working properly and Everytime using pin to open.some defect also in Sim slot because my customer complain that your contact being  done don't buy anything from Amazon because their return and replacement policy is fraudulent that I experienced in purchase of this mobile
1,Battery backup is very low.if mob charge 100% then we can use only for max 2 hours it it totally waste of money. Camera quality is good but battery storage is very very low ..don't buy
5,"Excellent phone, however price is on higher side as the processor doesn't matches the competitors devices. Device is sleek and stylish"
4,"The phone received having a Mic issue and got replacement within 12 Hrs, But the second phone also have Mic issue, other side persons cannot hear proper voice. Headset also have issues for voice calls.Average CameraHaving Long Battery lifeBest value for money phoneFor games it is best"
1,I have removed stars from 4 to 1 after using from 2 and half months. The phone is pathetic except for looks. It hangs alot.
5,I'm giving this marks for this price segment after 1 week usageDisplay -> 10/10Fingerprint reader -> 10/10Battery -> 8/10Speaker -> 9/10Camera -> 9/10Performance -> 8/10Overall -> 9/10Great value for money (Rs 13000)Got with 2500 Amazon coupon and SBI CREDIT CARD discount...Thanks Amazon for the great offer
1,"I have used this phone since from 4 days.I am not happy with it.Oppo which know as a good camera phone its deliberately wrong.This Oppo f17 phone had very bad camera quality.Which doesn't have basic feature of beightness,contrast and saturation.Number of cameras are 4 but none of them satisfies the quality as expected.When you click picture of some thing like furniture's it good but while taking selfie it takes really bad.Selfie is bad in manner before you clicking the streaming looks ok ok but when actually click the selfie it looks extremely bad.Plz don't waste money if you are a selfie lover,I am Redmi user which have very less price as that of Oppo still quality of Redmi is much better than this Opp f17.Wasted money üòí"
4,"Oppo F17 is certainly one of the best smartphone, but for those who love to have it domestically. The old age processor is the only shortcomings of this phone,but that is not causing any problems for its day to day operations. I love to have this sleek designed pretty."
1,"Hi I got this on September 24th, I'm not satisfied because  camera quality is not as expected, some time finger print sensor won't work unless I press power button and also I observed some hanging issue. I don't recommend this product purchase.Adding comments after 6 months.Lot of hanging issue. When I checked with service center they told that it is updated with trial version. No camera clarity, hanging issue. Totally worthless. Really disappointed. Feel like it is second hand mobile."
5,"Best phone only price high but in offer with rs1500 back as amazon pay balence  and bank offer rs1500 back .It cost me rs 15000 ,in this segmant its best only some time while phone screen lock finger print not activate but after software update it will definetly fixüòç"
3,"I don't know what is wrong with OPPO team, since last 2 years and 3 months I was using OPPO F9, what a great phone it was, so that only I moved up to wards F series and purchased OPPO F17, but I found it is little lowere side than OPPP F9, actually F17 must be far better than F9, but F17 is not at that level at all, in today's time mobile phone is much essential product, but F17 is very simple performance phone. If you wanted to have high performance phone than don't go this F17. Finger print sensor is not good."
1,The phone started lagging since we bought it. We thought let's use it  for couple of days and check. But it started working slow and lags continuously even while performing simple actions like opening call logs for making a phone. So just think how much it will lag to play games and other heavy apps. Please do no purchase this phone at all.. waste of money.  Zero stars for this phone. Also there is no refund option available for this phone so I'm stuck with this phone now which hangs and lags continuously.
3,Though RAM is high but very slow display and operation. Camera quality is also not up  to the mark as per specification . Battery life is ok. Price should be within 15k as per performance I am getting. So Not recommended.
1,"I was provided with a faulty mobile with both the speakers are not working (opined by your technician). The item has been replaced and again I received defective mobile with same problem. It clearly indicates that no QC has been done or intentionally defective.item has been supplied to me. Moreover, I have wasted hours of my valuable time in speaking with amazon customer care. I will think twice before purchasing a phone from Amazon and I will share my view with my friends."
5,I really liked product. The phone came with good quality packaging. Phone is also good. I loved camera quality and speed functioning of phone.
1,"I had previously used Oppo f7 for almost 3 years and I had no complains whatsoever. That was the reason I trusted Oppo f17 but I was proved wrong. The touchscreen causes issues, battery life is disgusting. The only good thing about it is the vooc changing and nothing else"
3,"Well in terms of looks this is one of the best phones how ever there is a major issue with this phone it does not unlock easily there is a lag ,at times neither finger print sensor nor face unlock sensor respond , all though many user have mentioned about this problem still there is no update from oppo, just an average camera at this price was not expected...Price for oppo f17 should have been under 12k....."
1,"Don't buy,touch not working properly.finger print not working properly"
2,Sim tray looks like used and old. Rear Camera quality is not up to the mark. Only back side design looking good. Front camera quality is OK OK.Phone runs  at normal speed.Battery charging speed also good.We have to buy fonts from themes store if we need to change.
4,"Was looking for a Lightweight(<165g),Slim and Pocket friendly Phone for <14k.Bought in during Amazon Great indian Festival in OFFER during Oct 2021.Got it for 11k  ie(2000rs Discount Coupon+ Exchange  offer(3k) +  debit card 10% off)PROS: 1)Slim,Lightweight and Pocket friendly2) Good front Camera3) AMOLED Display4) Update to Android 11 AvailableCONS:1) Manufacturing date is  1 yr old (bought in oct 2021, Date of manufacture is sep 2020) . was afraid if there would be any battery drain Issue(no issue so far but still checking)2) Main rear Camera is average.3)the OPPO 's pre installed Screen Protector(most oppo,vivo phones got this) was already having air bubbles inside it.4) Not for heavy Gaming Users.5) Battery life is Average.FINAL VERDICT : since oppo is already realised F19 series for 20k, u might want to get this only if ur on tight budget  who want AMOLED + slim lightweight mobile for around 13k.BUY it during SALE/OFFER ONLY."
5,"The camera is above average could be better for sure.The battery life is decent.Looks, in hand feel and one hand usage of this phone is probably the best under 20000Rs. price tagThe chipset could be better but here the main thing is what you wantüëáA better performance or a better experienceBecause I bought realme 7 and oppo f17 at the same time  with same price.The performance of realme 7 is unbeatable in this price but however there were a huge number of bugs in realme 7 but in my oppo f17 the performance was enough for a moderate gamer no lags, stutters at all on medium to low settings but I encountered zero bugs or issues in my oppo f17 which should be appreciated as Realme 7 has exhausted me with so much bugs but oppo f17 has given me a smooth experience so If experience is more important for you than performance than you should go for it"
4,"Mobile is good specially it's slimness light weight looks stylish, camera is average, but performance is normal than other a basic phone under 10 KI only deslike that Internet performance it's very slow I used multiple sim but it runs slow.as other basic oppo phone has good Internet speed."
5,"We'll, i am a guy who digs in specifics but when my mom wants a cell all of specifics goes out of the window. What becomes important are looks, feel , comfort of the phone. This is the lightest, prettiest, and decent phone in mid range segment. Got 2k off by coupon at 14700. In this price range samoled screen and other features are decent. Dont expect strongest processor or best camera, this phone shines in look and feel rest all are industry standard in this price range."
3,In the specification it is written that phone has primary camera and touch panel But it has only fm and Bluetooth and music player .On the box also the same is mentioned Just now purchased .BT dialer Fm and audio player ok .Sim and battery to be tested

1,"In this price segment this is the worst mobile I have used yet. Camera is above average not best, there is a big issue in this phone is network and wifi connection issue.Phone automatically disconnected wifi connection all the time and network is also very weak comparing to other mobiles. One big issue I found today that touch is working automatically. And there is another problem with Amazon to replace the phone that now I have to post the phone to Amazon then they will send a new phone.Third class performance"
1,Video Player is loading.
1,"I have purchased 8A dual but its not a good product ,i have buy many product from amazon but i havent recevied such a bab product these phone camera is not good & get blink any while opening app..& phone get swtich off..while video call camera is not stable i request you to change the product & refund the money asap...i m not happy with this product..these issue i m facing from 1 month.."
5,"This is one of the cheap smartphone according to its features.Battery capacity is amazingCamera is ok not so good.Two things I dislike about this Phone that it is made in China not only mobile, adapter is also made in China and the second thing is 10w charger is given in this box we have to purchase separately.Sound quality is clear and too lound I liked this also.Overall I like this Phone.Note: We have to use invoice as a warrenty card to claim our warrentybecause Warrenty Card is not separately given inside the box. So I request the seller to give invoice in good condition to customers because I have not received invoice in good condition.  (For those customers who have written ""Warrenty Card is not given"" in their review and for the seller).Hope this will help.Thank you."
5,"Undoubtedly, Motorola and Xiaomi i were the initiators of budget cellphone segment. Xiaomi with her mind boggling specs at a rock bottom price enabled the common men think about owning a smart phone...Xiaomi has done a similar In this latest model 8A dual... All required features for an above average utility is packed in this model. The build is stable and handy, though a bit bulky. OS version is pretty decent. 4G VoLTE enables WiFi calling. Dedicated dual sim support comes handy for office and personal sim use.The screen cast is seamless and can enjoy all screen content of cellphone on a big screen. Ideal for students to pick those online classes as the speakers gives a very loud and clear audio...The screen size is pretty big and display is so clear and the scroll is comparable to any high end phones...Gaming also doesn't give even a bit of lag...Some new software features are also introduced by MI in this model though it's a beta version.Overall,This product gives a real Value for money"
5,It's working fineBest phone in this rangeLooking for I was looking for a phone under 8000 for my younger brother as he was having very tight budget so I search many phone went to market in the market offline this phone was being sold about 8500 but I got on Amazon in 7500 only you can see it is available on Flipkart another platform over 8000Other alternative of his phone in the same range having low quality processor and no gorilla glass screen c type charging in this range you cannot find anywherePhone has premium looks
1,"The phone got slow after one week use, i wanted to replace but the replace window is closed. Camera & battery are average, It's not like 13MP & 5000Mah. The device is not suitable to play any game even ludo, it's started lagging when you open ludo and after shut any from your app your home display become blank for few seconds ...........Worst experience.Dear Amazon team, please help to replace the device."
4,"No fingerprint (Just a warning)Camera quality is average but at par in this price range.Battery backup is excellent, it can easily last for 1.5 days for an average user.It has dual mic for better noise cancellation. Xiaomi has removed that in Redmi 9 seriesI wanted this as a daily driver for my father who is a very light user. All he want is calling, WhatsApp and some YouTube. But the phone's OS(MIUI) seems to be super aggressive in killing apps. There's an observable lag in opening the dialer or WhatsApp after unlock. The lag do go-away during subsequent use, but only as long as you do not let the phone go to sleep.TBH I think Xiaomi is involved in ""planned obsolescence"" for their lower range phones like this. But. it's just my personal opinion based on managing the Redmi, Note and Poco series for my family over the years. Of all, Asus and Motorola phones aged better according to me. They died a dignified death instead of going sluggish after updates. Heard Samsung is also doing good. I am planning to boot custom ROM like Lineage OS and see if it's really about some sneezy OS scam like other manufacturers (looking at you Apple)."
1,"The phone does not boot up. I am not sure what quality check has gone into the product. unfortunately I was not able to return the product on time and the return window got lapsed. Now I am running at the MI brand store to get the product replaced. I spoke with amazon customer care and the seller and they were not willing to replace the product as it got out of the window. What good is a phone if it does not even boot up, What quality testing was done on the phone. Worst exp with amazon and with the seller. I was asking them for replacement as I could not ope n the product on time due to medical issues."
1,Guys please don't go for this product. After 10 days it automatically turned OFF and I had to fastboot the same to keep on working. Now the wifi is not properly connecting.2 GB is not worth buying + too many ads and slowness to the core.I would suggest amazon to stop dealing with such kind of products. I have been a regular buyer but this product seriously made me sick.
1,"Wrist phone for purchase. Not just this but any Mi phone.They replaces every single piece of app (even the basic apps like clock and calculator) and asks to use internet and provide conscent to privacy policy.God knows why they need to replace such basic app and why these apps need to use internet. I denied the permissions and result - Phone restarting abruptly. Can't even start the phone in safe mode. Same thing.My first Mi phone and I know for sure this is last. Never buying another mi phone and will try and get rid of this as soon as possible.Crossed the 7 day return period and not I am stuck with this plastic piece of garbage.Want to buy a phone, buy one which has stock or near to stock android, gets the most out of same hardware in terms of performance."
1,"I purchased this product only cause my one plus was broke and I couldn‚Äôt get it repaired on time. I needed a spare phone for emergencies and I bought this product considering the cost factor. I‚Äôve never used any of RedMi products and since RedMi claim that they are the products for cost I wanted to give it a try. As I expected, it‚Äôs the worst performance phone. I‚Äôm not talking about the performance equal to a premium smartphone. I‚Äôm talking about basic use. The touch is worse. It taps automatically and makes the usage of phone a nightmare. Have to restart it multiple times to fix that issue temporarily. U never know when the same error occurs. Other than that, major thing is ‚ÄúTHE DEVICE TURNS OFF ALL OF SUDDEN FROM NOWHERE AND WONT TURN ON AT ANY COST‚Äù. Nobody knows why that happened and will have to factory reset the device from device factory mode. Will never buy any of the RedMi products just because of price. I‚Äôd rather get a good quality product even if I have to pay a little more money.I‚Äôd not recommend at all be it any product coming from this company."
4,Did lot of research before buying.At this budget this the best phone I found it in market. I am not big fan of redmi. But it is cost effective and good for short term use.Over all phone is okay don‚Äôt expect much .Sound quality is good.Battery life is also good.Have all the required basic features.Camera is not that great if you need good camera dont go for it.Phone is heating while charging.Go for it if it fit in your budget.Overall okay.
2,The phone slows down as you use it over an year or more.Even cleaning up memory phone as well as card does not help.Even uninstalling the apps did not help.I got similar feedback from other users.I had purchased a Motorola for myself and gifted this Redmi to my Mom.The Motorola runs more apps but still performs better than the Redmi
3,"Battery life is good, continue using nearly one day coming. Slow in processing speed, not good. Before I used redmi 5a that is good, screen size is heavey not fits in pocket, this is also not good, it's useful who stays in home. For working part not compact , heavy size. Overall it's average, but in battery it's 100 % good. Minius is size heavy, and slow process for works with phone. Thanks for Amazon for thiis mobile."
1,I bought this phone and within just 2-3 months of use the battery is dead. From the first day I started using this phone the phone is draining charge quickly and one day after 3 months of use the battery is dead. So if you are looking for a phone with good battery life never buy this phone. Also the phone comes with many buggy apps that you did not need. I did not use many apps and I did not play games in this phone. I have only installed a 5-6 apps that I need in this phone. It cannot even run these apps without the phone hanging. Every time I open an app and run an app it just hangs after sometime. The phone just hanged for no reason most of the time even after I removed few apps because I thought these apps are the reason for this. Then I learned from my experience this is a phone that just hangs all the time.  It is better you buy some other phone from other trusted brands than this one. My advice to everyone is do not buy this phone and waste your money. I gaurentee this phone become useless within 2-3 months after you have bought this. Because I did not used this phone heavily and used it only for making calls and some essential apps I need. I suspect either I got a defective phone from the seller or the phone is not good.
5,"Simple smartphone, but Good Smartphone! Camera average but included PRO mode, Battery backup excellent Charged 4 days ago. Used normal internet and Dual 4G native video calling and WiFi Hotspot without gaming till now. Display 6'22"" good, No lag, Good face detection. Overall 9/10 but if you consider the price then it's 10/10 actually."
4,"I am using this product for general purpose from last 01 month & my children are also using it for their study. Phone is working in O.K. condition. Phone's fingerprint reader, battery life & camera quality is good. only one thing is disappointed me that is lack of selfi flash if there will be salfi flash then photos could be taken more better."
5,"I bought this Phone #MIDNIGHT GREY so that I can review it and post it on my youtube channel and found good so gave it to my grandmotherSo let's start reviewing with pros and consPros:-1) #BIIIIIIGER BATTERY:- Yes u have read it  right, It comes with a great battery life  of 5000 mah battery2) #CAMERA:- It comes with rear dual üì∑  13mp+2mp, yeah it's good @ this  price, Selfie camera is also good3)  #CHARGING:- It comes with a Type-c charger and support upto 18w fast charging.. Surprisingly the charger supplied in the box is 10w charger4) #MIUI 11:- It runs on the #Android 9 and MIUI 11..Great optimization by #Mi It is also said it will have a #ANDROID 10 UPDATE and #MIUI 125) #SCREEN:- It is good at this price point  For watching videosCons:-1) #IR BLASTER:- Yes, you  read it right It doesn't have a IR BLASTER (I FIND IT A CON)..as MI Never skipped sensor2) #PROCESSOR:- It packs a average processor #SNAPDRAGON 439, Not a great processor for heavy user or gamers..so beware User3) #SPEAKER:- It is not that loud..#AVERAGEPs:- Im editing video @ this very point..  So when my video is ready I will add a link to my youtube channel for detailed informationThank you"
3,"It is what it is and gives you what is mentioned but I would just say that the display quality is not that good I mean the display is a very cheap HD plus display. Camera is quality is fine.Not so goodNot so greatNot so badThe only disappointment was with the display quality.Battery backup is great, no doubt in that.Well it‚Äôs not a gaming phone but can hold up applications like WhatsApp & Instagram."
5,"Nice phone!!!In every segment it's best. display n camera quality is not very good,but in Rs-7499 price point it's worthy...  Specially it's back side texture n Redmi branding on frontDiL Le Liya yaar !!!!"
1,"wifi, every 1min disconnects even from 1mtr of router. Raised a complain. Service centre told factory reset. First time facing Such issue. Xiomi you Just lost a customer.Don't want visit considering current covid and  also stories from xiomi services.I gave video, log every thing to them. As I also work in Mobil domain, i know it is defect which they should know.before."
4,"6:25 inches screen with HD display,gorilla glass 6 smooth swipe and touch gesture,though it has an AI technology the camera is average overall and good budget phone comes with android 9 (pie) though  like the oreo version more overall a good budget phone"
3,"The phone overall is nice hardware & software package ""on paper""In usage, however, I experience way too much UI lags and slowness that didn't exist even on Redmi 1s and Redmi 7AI wonder if more people experience the same or is it about my particular unit"
5,"Yeah camera quality is not so good...but at this price what do you expect??? üôÑas I saw some comments related to camera quality only but I want to ask them what do you want at this price an ""Apple iPhone 12 Pro""üòÇ. Well anyways, I think this is the best phone at this price in the market, battery life is so good and love the colour of the phone and but yes, I don't recommend this phone to game addicted person ... or otherwise you can go for it ...üëç"
4,"I've used many phones in this budget segment from renowned brands. I was always skeptical about Redmi/Xiaomi. It was hard to make a decision of buying this phone. But to be honest, I'm totally moved! Be it the display, be it looks, usage, it is totally a power package. The amazing thing is, you're getting 5000 MAH battery in less than 8k ! Easily runs over 1.5 days with a full charge and average usage (multitasking, video streaming, browsing, social media). It also comes with 18W Fast Charging support. The display will blow your mind. Looks are quite good, could've been better. What is a drawback is it doesn't have a Fingerprint Sensor, which is a must for phones in this budget! Camera quality is ""just okay"".Lastly, I'm using this device for the last 4-5 days, didn't feel any lag though it comes with 2GB RAM, all credits to Redmi's amazing optimisation.You can go for it without a single doubt in your mind if your budget is right."
5,"this is a good smartphone which comes with the USB Type C, 5000mah Battery, Good Vivid Screen, Gorilla Glass 5 Protection ,Good Camera Dual rear Camera (13mp+2mp), 8mnp selfie camera which u don't find under other smartphones of  this Budget segment  to be noted do not compare with other high budget smartphones camera ABOVE 10Kand in the last latest android 10 update Released in india & latest MIUI 12 is on its way in next month2GB variant performs well  Ram remains all the time under 60% usageThis is Good Buck Performs and Give features u cannot find in other smartphones , and other smartphones which are available i'm sure they are under preform as per the new smartphones of Redmi 9A, Redmi 9 they even also not has these features and comes with the DOWNGRADED REBRANDED PROCESSOR"
5,"Gifted to my mom.I didnt want 6.5 inch big screen so purchased this to b handy for my mom.1. Camera is awesome. Added some pics in daylight, night, dim light and auto focus2. 2gb ram is fair enough for daily whatsapp a d calling application.3. Battery is superb. It lasted for 2 days with normal use. Fast charge option is also there. It took 1.5 hrs to full charge4. Display is fair. Not bad5. Camera is far better than samsung M21.Overall value for money product for nominal use persons. I got this at 6300/- (700/- credit card discount)"
4,Budget phone for people who are looking to buy their 1st smart phone in life. I bought it for my mother and she is happy with it. Serves the purpose of a first time smart phone user very well. Ordered grey colour.. looks nice tooFace recognition works only in best light. Not counting it as a negative since it is not a must feature. Camera quality is good ( expect what you will get at this price)
5,"Bigger battery, nice processor, good camera. Budget phone in this price segment. It's quite ok for the daily staff. The build quality and the back panel is the main highlights. But quite disappointed that no back cover is in with phone."
5,"When it comes to budget mobile phones with latest features u cant go wrong with Xiaomi phones. This model is  one such example. You get Good battery, Gorilla screen, big screen size (very big so some 1) etc. Overall value for money!"
1,"Very bad experience, just after 20 days, it is not working properly. Many times while using this ohone, it automatically closes all the apps and returns to home screen and then it just hangs and then we have to restart it to make it work again."
1,"No back cover, no screen guard, no fingerprint sensor, and no earphone in box, very bad camera, weak plastic backside. The screen broke after falling from 1 meter distance. I'm very unsatisfied by this phone. Also this is cheap china mobile. Avoid buying this phone. Don't waste money on this phone. Put some more money and get samsung, lg or apple mobile. You will regret after buying this phone."
2,This was my 3rd MI phone but now it will be the last. I bought this phone for my school work during lockdown. But I am highly disappointed. Especially due to the unwanted MI apps that not only eat space but are also irritating. Cleaning the storage is such a complicated task. I have now used this phone for 6 months and can confirm that the performance is pathetic. Constant software reboot required.
1,Please don't buy this phone. After a month used display is showing lots of lines. When I went to the servicing center of MI they charged me it was dropped at the floor. But I didn't dropped it and no one dropped it. They informed me its not cover under warranty. Please don't buy. I trusted Amazone also MI but this phone really hurt me a lots.
5,"Beautiful display, almost appears like fhd. Awesome battery lasts the day and still left for the next day. Good built quality great phone.Want a good smartphone under 7000?-look no more, this is the phone you want."
4,It was a good phone though it hs 2 BG ram but it looks was pretty good n battery was aswme whch was 5000 not even we get in othr top models and evn the fingerprint sensor r good but if u r buying thn buy wid 3gb or with 4gb wil more bettr
5,"It is a good phone. Nice and superb in model, and long life 5000 mah battery, absolutely good for gaming. It provide full screen option and swith option is nice thing. Camera is not out standing but very good. Dual Sim, dual camera and smart face lock. Good in quality, power full glasses and smooth. Advanced features available  here. Not only is good phone but also it's helpful. Low cost but quality is very good."
5,this phone is very very e nice and mid range is super best value for money phone redmi 8a dualthis phone in battery super charger super display sound quality superb but camera very very badspecial thank you For MI India and Amazon all team very very very thank youthis phone mid range very nice price and me e recommended this phone purchase you all of you
5,Nice product.Not much of the features but longer battery life is a big plus. Qualcomm¬Æ Snapdragon‚Ñ¢ 439 processor gives the smooth operation of the mobile. 32GB internal storage is sufficient enough.
1,Pls friend dont even try for this phone..... It is heating up badly....... And they are not replacing it....... Even it is my second day..... They are saying that heating is not a big problem...... My phone is heating upto 44 degree celcius and the range is above 45.......they are saying that 44 is not more than 45 so they will not replace  it
1,Broken display and wrong colour phone delivered..bad phone performance
1,Conditions not good damage please return thia asap
1,Battery is not proper work... Camera also not take capturing good quality of pictures.
1,"It has to to nogate 7.1 version of Android but was updated to 8.1 orio which has a wifi and recording issuesProduct was semi damaged in terms ofScratch on screesFallen marks of many sides of mobile,.And other aswellLastly if we wanna buy any new or used mobileWe will inspect the handset physically.We check with accessories available,Apps , how it works and other stuff, and if we like with it. Than we decide to bargain and than buyBut in Amazon why can we have these options. Specially when it is about renewed handsetWhere they are not guaranteed about accessories and other quality.Till date I have 2 new renewed mobilesWith original box n accessories.Why not this time.I recommend don't buy from mobilab seller they are worse."
4,Good productOnly less heating problem no other complaint
1,"Very bad touch screen, even I had return requested and on date they not picked and now I had faulty item. Please don't buy refurbished Moto phone."
5,This phone is great. But battery life is not so good. It is only 3000mah. Not great for game lovers but good for normal users.Sound quality is great. Phone reception quality is very good. The camera quality is also nice. It has many features. Graphics quality is very good.
3,You just couldn't get this phone in good condition under 5k. And I bought this for ‚Çπ4850. I gave it 3 stars and here is why:Phone has more than 7 scratches and out of them 4 are major that are clearly visible. So here I cut 1 Star.Phone display is changed and it's not coming out of frame but there is a gap between frame and display a very very little gap hardly noticeable but still there. I would have cut 2 stars but the display is original so I cut just 1 start moreThis phone has 2 cameras but one camera is full of dust but that is just a secondary camera (Camera that assist primary camera to click portrait shots) so doesn't affect picture quality but one camera is full of dust so look ugly. Now since camera just work fine and price I got it is very low I won't cut any star so giving this phone overall 3 stars out of 5.
2,"the display quality is not same as a brand new one, the seller needs to mention about the after refurbished condition of a product, I already have a MOTO G5S PLUS, as I loved this and needs two phone at a time for me I ordered for the refurbished one as my secondary phone, but disapointed with the inner display as it is a redish one compared to my existing brand new model which is a clear one, all other thing is as good in the refurbished G5S PLUS"
3,Phone is ok. All feature are working fine. Only problem is with USB tethering but I think that is also due to Android naugat OS since in my old phone Android lollipop this feature was working.
5,A 13 mp single camera would be better than this.
1,I'm not able to receive or send any voice calls.. When I tried to find the reason behind this I found out this is a defective product which was already used in the year 2017. Such worst experience. I don't recommend this product to anyone.
4,You can buy this phone if and only price under 4700Good product don't believe in fake reviewsThis product is good  no issues found till nowBest productBelieve meI also seen reviews but all reviews are fake so close your eyes and buy this productI swear you love itThanks
5,This is the first time I have purchased a refurbished product. I had my doubts but so far so good... But I guess you are always taking a chance when buying refurbished electronic item...
4,First of all this is refurbished phone that doesn't mean it is new. It doesn't contain earphones and real charger of the phone although at this price mobile is too good no problem at all...It performance is like a new phone.No issues with this phome..
4,"Awesome mobile in low price,superb built quality, average battery life,overall best product."
3,"Old mobile , already scratchCall center feedback this is certified mobile , certified mobile means scratch available,but technically no issues,looking is old mobile,"
3,"Dear sir,I purchased Moto g5s plus jan-17-2021. Now mobile touch is not working.Please consider my request and how to claim warranty."

1,Very bad vCamera not expected
4,This phone is value for money and packed with all that you need out of a smart phone in this range.Battery performance is satisfactory.Cons: At time‚Äôs the touch screen does not respond quickly as time lag is experienced between a finger gesture and response from the screen.AI of the camera delivers artificial pictures.Conclusion: This is a good buying option in this range must go for it.
1,Touch screen not working as i have received used phone . Very bad seller
5,"So far it's working very nicely, fingerprint sensor is fast, camera quality is nice for me as we all know how oppo stands out incase of camera quality.Cons - idk yetPackaging was very bad not upto the mark , as u r sending a phone there should have been slight precautions taken while sending the package, it was too lose and phone box was literally moving from one side to another badly."

1,Bakwas Q ke sound problamAal sound very low. Not extra speker only one speaker incoming and out goingBakwas third class mobilePlese this mobile not purchesses
4,"Hopefully, a fair review after 24 hours of usage.Pros:1. Camera (both front and back) - A very decent one even on low lights.2. Huge battery backup - It can really withheld for 3 days for day to day usage.3. Performance - Fair one TBH. Obviously G35 at this price range is upto industry standards.4. Android 11 out of box. Hope Tecno keeps the device updated for next two years.5. Display - Bright and crisp (though 269ppi). But upto standards and smooth touch sensitive.6. Flash lights - Perfect and bright 4 LEDs at back and two in front. Front LED is also bright enough. One of it lights up during charge inlet with dimmed brightness.7. A plastic back case and screen protector film (already applied).Cons:1. Missing Type-C. It is micro USB.2. Battery - Charging duration takes ages. 3+ Hours!!3. Finger print scanner - one of worst at this price range. You had to adjust the finger to find right spot.4. Bloatware - Huge list of uninstalable list of apps.5. Front LEDs - No option to be used for notification alerts.To conclude, good one at this price range. But honestly, it could have been a 500 bucks more lesser considering branding which is striving to come up. One can easily go for top brands in market for the same configuration with and additional 500 bucks. Hopefully, Tecno doesn't let their customer down like the way other few brands did."
1,Very poor quality phone don't buy this phone phone is very slow and hanging problem heating problem also
1,sound and camera quality not goodPicture Quality badCamera performance averageSound Quality very very poorTotally disappointed....

3,"There is some lag while opening apps, speaker quality is not good, otherwise everything is good at this price (got at ‚Çπ7999)"
5,"Its a value for money phone. You can't expect smooth performance from a low budget phone like this. But this is a very good mobile for daily uses.With heavy uses it gives 2days battery life.Both the cameras are on par. Nothing great, nor bad.Lots of bloatware on the UI.Loudspeaker volume is little low, but sound while calling is very clear and high.Overall it's a good phone for the people who have tight budget or doesn't need super camera/gaming experience."
4,Speaker quality is not upto the mark
1,Worst sound quality 1st day hang finger print not work properly totally unsatificed with this mobile. I was asking about return this prodcut but amazon is refuse this i lost 9000 rs. I am never ever buy from amazon. Totally dissapointed

It's a depreciating asset. It's going to die in one or max two years.Instead, buy a good home product for your wife mother or sister and live in a good environment.Jai HindHave a great day!"
4,"*PROS -1.Battery backup is amazing.2.Rear camera quality is awesome, Front camera quality is good.3.phone design is unique & attractive.*CONS -1.Support only 10W charging.2.Only one Speaker for both calling & Music.3.Fingerprint sensor very bad,It doesn't work properly, it works 4/10 times.I give 0 rating for fingerprint sensorSo,i said to tecno to fix this problem.,Otherwise phone is awesome."

Even after 2 hour continuous gaming, battery gives great backup.Processor - No lag at all if you are doing gaming or anything, it's performance is awesome.Best phone by tecno in this price. You should go for it ...."
3,Good phone in this price segment.Pros-1. Better battery performance2. 48mp camera3. Unique designCons-1. Major cons _ fingerprint is not good.It works worse.i have never seen this type of fingerprint in smartphones in last 5 years.2. Micro usb cable3. Speaker quality4. Location of power button.
3,Poor Product only thing that I liked is camera which is good at this price range... but other than that it hangs a lot...and heats up as well.. no recommended..this is my 1st and last tecno Product..bye bye tecno..
5,"I bought this phone without knowing much about the company. It was just a gamble which paid off. I got it at Rs 7740, and comparing it's specifications with its price, I feel it is a steal deal.Pros at this price:6 gb RAM and 6 gb storage_5 starsCamera AI and 48 MP _5 starsFinger touch sensor_4starsFace unlock sensor_ 5 starsBattery life _ 4 starsTouch and feel _5 starsSoftware is similar to OPPo but response is better.Cons: a bit heavy ( may be due to huge battery)Overall a good purchase."
3,"Review after 40days of use , The net speed is mostly bytes /sec. not connecting to online classes at this speed. I haven't seen in bytes /sec.  in my other mobiles. To attend online classes mobile data is not going to be used as the speed is b/ s.  The mobile has good features 4gb RAM 64gbROM, 48MP rear camera  + AI camera, front camera 8MP, 6000mah battery @ Rs 8000 is  good but netspeed in this phone disappointed alot.  If you watch movies or attend online meetings then don't ................................ don't ................ ."
3,Good camera . Double flashing on front screen.Baterry life ok.Big screen.I bought it for 8599/-In this price everything is well good except the speaker üîä.They could have given a dedicated speaker for music and videos.
2,"Average quality. But I bought this phone with 48mp camera's expectations. I'm disappointed. My vivo phone's 13 mp camera quality is far far better than this. Finger print is always a problem. Sometimes touch screen also not working properly. Even though it has a 4gb ram and 64 memory I additionally added a 64 gb samsung memory card,, All after this phone is hanging and lagging..even contacts is opening slow. I don't have any big games on my phone though. Inbuilt palm store ads are coming daily to install some apps. Everything inside is Google's including Dialer. It has call recording option but you cannot record a call without other parties knowledge. When we press record or put it in auto record it says NOW THE CALL IS BEING RECORDED loudly. Which can be heard from both sides speakers. We are using record option for our safety purpose. If someone is harassing or bullying or even blackmailing how will we handle that. It is not women friendly mobile.. I suggest women not to buy this phone."
4,Battery: 5/5Performance: 4/5Camera: 3/5Speaker: 3/5Display : 4/5Don't get trapped for 48 mp.. it's very average .. except camera  rest all satisfactory
5,"Techno Spark 7TCondition 1- Battery status shows chargingIf we switch off the  power of adaptorCondition 2- if phone connected to charging ,if we toggle the power of adaptor (if power is on then switch of and on again)it shows symbol of charging butDoes not charge.Condition 3- it has no loudspeaker other than earpeace ,sound is not loud and clear when we play videoSo please return ,bcoz 7t me model ka software problem haiNo replacement no refund option given please dont buy at all"
3,I am happy to by this phone .. It's better than 5000-6000 MI brand phone ..1..Wifi catching system low .. other phone catching 2 bar but this phone catching null ..2 .. Network capping quality very poor ..3 .. Speaker very very low quality .. One head side speaker it's pathetic .. & Sound I am don't explain ..4 .. Fingerprint point sensor not good .. more than one tach then unlock..
2,"I am having problem with the speaker and mic. When we speak we get to hear our own echo. Other person cannot hear you and you cannot hear the other side. It's absolutely useless as phone. It is good as camera, games and extra things. Service is not available. The number they provide for service says he has closed down the shop. The other service centre is a repair shop who is working for the company as freelance. You have to give the phone to them if they can repair they will do it or else send it HO for spare parts which can take 10 to 15 days minimum ( that's the warranty coverage). If you have patience and a spare phone buy it on your own risk.New review as of today 19/9/21The other side cannot hear me.Very bad till today no body responds.Very very very bad"
1,It's have two main bug that you can't avoid1. Volume is too low . You can't listen music  after 3 to 6 months of purchase without earphone2. While charging ; charger heat too much.Otherwise it's good...But please buy until you ok with it.
4,"I gifted this to my mother, it's good and easy to use, camera quality is not upto mark anyone can recollect its digitally managed. Android version is good easy to implement could say better than other cheap devices from Chinese market."
4,"I bought this phone to gift it to my wife. She was always complaining on how her staff used to taunt her for old phone.Thanks Ganpati Bappa, I found tecno spark 7T phone which comes in unfer 11k price range but it is on Android 11.0What you may dislike is1. Two OS; one is Android 11 and other is HiOS7. Why to have two?2. Yellowish tint in camera picture3. Only two camera are givenWhat I like-1. Price range2. 48 MP camera3. Lightweight4. Android 11 OS with lots of features5. Dual front flash6. 6000 mhA battery life"
5,"Brilliant camera, huge battery life and brilliant display in addition with the premium feeling of SAMSUNG. It's a shame that this phone's launch was delayed due to lockdown.Highly Recommended phone üòäüòä"
5,As a title it is obviously a monsterAnd very very good performance
3,"I am writing my review after using it for 6 days.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range."
1,"Very poor performance. Hangs aloft. Even I don't use any gaming app. In browsing only, this phone lacks. Inspite of having 6 GB RAM. This product serves zero rating. Please don't buy  this. Wastage of money. No refund policy for this device."
5,"Its a one season wonder. All was good till the one year mark.I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great for one year. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I was more than satisfied TILL ONE YEAR.After the one year and two month mark the phone started to automatically restart and freeze every 5 minutes of usage. Went to Samsung care and they said the motherboard has issues and need to be replaced and asked me to pay Rs 8000 since the warranty period was over. To my surprise the issue was not only with my phone. Many M21 buyers had the same issue, although some were lucky enough to have replaced the motherboard in warranty period.So my point is this phone is not a Rs 14499 phone instead it is a Rs 14499 + Rs 8000 phone if you want it to use it more than 1 year. In brief it is a Rs 22499 phone. You can get better phones in this price range.AVOID AT ALL COST"
2,Even realme performs better.....few issues which concerned me after use were1. When recording slow motion videos...there is  always flicker on screen.2. fingerprint sensor needs more than few attempts to work3. Camera is better than realme but not as good as redmi4. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming5. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone6. Mobile data connection vanishes many times in a day...I thought it was my airtel network .....but the same sim works on my old volte phone...without any issue....Suggestions for people who have bought this phone.....Since company does not provides a screen guard..... Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early...Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone.....If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....I am attaching two videos one in normal mode.....second in slow mode.....both videos are made by m21......you can see the flikr effect in second video easily..
5,Very Nice Mobile good all
1,Heating problem. In simple browising only phone gets heated up in upper side. When asking for replacement amazon customer care they are fooling us. Very pathetic condition.
1,"The phone(M21 Raven Black) is not working properly since its purchase. After the first installation, it is on frequently on and off mode and even restarts after more than 30 minutes. Moreover 4-5 times it takes more than 2 hours for starting.I also register a complaint to Amazon regarding this. I don't need such a disgusting phone any more. it wastes my 3 days. So, I request to Amazon kindly refund my money, I don't need replacement."
5,Just one word AMAZING
1,Now Amazone has REPLACED THE DAMAGED ONE NOW THE PHONE IS GOOD ENOUGH...PREVIOUS ONE WAS Nonsence What A Nonsence Battery It Comes to 90% Charge After a full charge only if u do something in10 minutes.... What nonsence is this. NEED REPLACEMENT. Do you people think customers are Mad.
1,"After 5 hrs continuously  charging level reach 55 %,during call sound quality not clear,a lot of heating problem,camera quality not good,network issue,slow processing..poor performance"
1,Heating problems
1,Otg pendrive not supported
1,"This phone's video,photo quality and audio quality is very poor"
5,"I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.üòÄ"
1,"Samsung m21 Mobile not in the delivery box, only charger and pin are available. Need refund for the same.For mobiles, its better to opt for cash on delivery, to avoid getting cheated."
4,"Looks like just to clear the unsold stock of m30s they gave it a new name and advertised it as a totally new phone. Everything is similar to m30s, except the price (and selfie camera). Good thing is that they kept the price low.Just got it delivered today. So far so good, many users compalined about battery, charging speed, display issues on m30s. Hope they got it resolved in m21."
1,Samsung Co. Claims that Samsung M21 has fast charging facility and It has 6000 mAh battery but these two claims are totally bogus because I've purchased Samsung M21 and received my order yesterday after using this phone I plugged in charger for charging it took approximate 9 hours to charge the Mobile phone and after full charging approximate 2 hours the Mobile phone battery get reduced 50%. I'm totally disappointed with this phone.
4,A nice looking phone.Light weight because of the plastic body. Performance is pretty good.But it doesn't feel like a 6000 mAh battery. Probably a little shy of that figure. It Drains relatively quickly than what is expected of a 6000 mAh capacity.But overall a product worth it's price. Probably not good for high performance gaming.But expect it to be durable with a low-medium usage.
1,"Don't like this product. It looks, it's already used by someone else. Apps are not downloading. It shows 6 appsare downloading. I'm confused."
3,"It charges very slowly, though they claim that it has fast charging?Has anyone else also facing this issue?"
1,Amazon delivered a defective phone to me and then they don't even receive my call while I tried to approach them.  Buying Samsung Galaxy M21 is waste of money.
1,1. I bought this to gift it to my dear one but I am shocked to see the camera quality of this phone is like 1 mb. I tried all the modes but it enhances the photo brightness automatically and and the photo becomes like a cartoon.2. Tried installing other camera apps but still the quality is poor.3. Tried options for returning but found that there is no option for that.4. Spoke to customer care and they say that they can only replace if the product is damaged and no option for quality related issues. I said that I am ready to buy any other product too. But no response from them.It‚Äôs better to buy from local store than going behind Amazon.
5,Value for money
1,What can I say just after 30 min.of recieving this phone I applied for return my money. Before this phone I already have 2 phone of Samsung's working good but this phone made in India is hot like a oven.I can't take it near my ears .I have to use ear phone.I call customer care they give me different different idea but problem remain same.I don't give advice to buy this product to any one be careful.
3,"I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21.The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED displayThe issues I faced are1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP).4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging.Among all these issues I believe it is an average deal under 13k"
4,"I like the camera quality, screen sensitivity,  and browsing experience. The speed is excellent.I don't like it's sound. The speaker is not the best, sometimes when I put on loud speaker the person I am speaking to will complain they cannot hear me. Plus when I play music the sound is not the best. Also, the phone does not come with original earphones so you have to hustle for that. Lastly it will take 3 hours to charge and still the battery will only last for 24hours."
5,"Display good, battery  performance  after one  week  of use has improved,camera is good,hope Samsung  provides  regular  updates..Excellent  phone  keep good  work  up Samsung üëå"
1,Battery  drain quickly... and phone heat a lot.
1,recently i ordered samsung M21 6GB RAM 128GB Flash.Unboxed and started the phone. it surprised to see so much of heated while booting itself.I tried to inform to Amazon . they tested with some remote diagnostics application surprisingly it showed the temperature is degree.I am using Samsung phones long time. this time my experience with M21 is very very badNew buyers please little careful about heating issue
1,Giving only one star because it compulsory. Sensor not working and heating fast
5,"Realy very very good phone,but stil I did not get,due to covid"
1,Received Samsung M 21 yesterday..highly disappointed  about slow charging and poor quality of camera..did not expect this from Samsung.I suggest not to buy this mobile.
5,I got this phone 11249. Best Display best Battery Good camera and Samsung BrandingSo people must buy this phone this price.Other phone can't beat
4,"Amazing phone But m not satisfied with camera quality, its 48MP? I used samsung galaxy S8 its only 12MP single camera which is good for m21 tripple camera.One more thing is back panel is plastic which is not good looking inthis range ..Its not feel premium with this budget...."
2,"I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s.M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacksM21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50sBattery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick.Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage.Pros:Super amoled screen6000 MaH batteryCons:Signal strength is very poor.(You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app)Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc"
5,"Liked the quality of the product from OPPO and the design.. It's far better than the Samsung M and A series mobiles.. Samsung mobiles are too delicate which are small drop also will loss the screen which cost you half of the mobile cost.. Currently I'm using OPPO F11 Pro, I liked a lot so I bought the oppo for my family.."
4,"Product is good but I didnot received handset.But it was written on website that handset is included.Please send handset,I really need it."
5,A s Lim phone very good
5,Good product I m so happy good berry baicp
1,OPPO not giving a genuine service. They don't trust the buyers. In my opinion they selling mobiles to... come back to there service stores. After 1 month my a15 OPPO Mobile suddenly turned off. The service section said touch and screen not working. They asked rs.3200 to change. I never droped my mobile and there is no physical damage i asked for warranty they opened and showed me inside there is a liquid problem i said I never droped mobile into water then how it happens. After 30 min no warranty coverd if you want pay the money to change screen. Even without any mistake from coustomer they blaming and saying some technical issues. If there is a mobile internal problem what we can do. The same day before me almost 4 coustomers said same problem mobile suddenly off.Finally OPPO A15 MOBILE IS A FAILURE SET. AND OPPO NOT PROVIDING  GENUNE TRUSTED SERVICE.
1,Very disappointed! The phone worked good for 15days of time and then touch is not working t all ! My return period I have crossed. And touch sense is absolutely a disaster. Never had such experience from Amazon and the return policy was only for 8 days that is disgusting!!!!

So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s.M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacksM21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50sBattery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick.Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage.Pros:Super amoled screen6000 MaH batteryCons:Signal strength is very poor.(You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app)Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc"
1,Bakwas phone
3,"Few issues are resolved that are mention below..but still this mobile hasn't the charm of OnePlus..It is like a normal android..not an OnePlus..Low processing, Exceptional features of OnePlus are not there in this phone..Took so long time to delete items..Battery is draining fast..Charging is not as fast as claimed..Earlier I was using OnePlus 5T..I bought it to upgrade but unfortunately it degrades..."
4,The best part of the phone is it's super simple and user friendly operating system. Camera doesn't oversaturate colours and captures decent photos. Battery charging is super fast. People argue that this is overpriced in this segment but I guess ease of using the phone and mainly the OS wouldn't be so good in other comparable phones. It is super light and handy.Edit: taking away 1 star from the review after a month's usage.Phone app lags all the time. Phone starts ringing when I receive a call while the name of caller appears 5 seconds later. This is very annoying. Similar issue while calling. Hope some software update fixes this issue.
1,Phone looks good but features are 10k phoneCamera is worstPerformance is not goodI recommend to go like vivo or oppo
5,"Performance is really good - no lags at allPerfectly smooth user experience.COD gaming - quality medium, frame rate max - fps 57-60.Quality high, max frame rate - fps - 45-58Battery easily lasts more than one day with 1 hour gaming and 2-3 hours YouTube/Netflix etc.Super fast charging.Cameras are good too.Not as good as pixel 4a but almost 90% as good.Single speaker is a let down, but still enough loud.No ois but software stabilization is good.Overall, very satisfied with the phone.Really enjoying using the phone.Simply trust OnePlus, they know how to make good phones."
1,"23 jun-Update after using almost 4 days,Front camera sucks, I have changed my phone after 3 years and ut is 24k phone which doesn't even have nice front camera, there is too much lag in front camera, you will have to stay steady (atleast 30 secs)to have nice selfie, if you are someone who is looking to change the phone for camera then just think about it, selfie camera is going to give you headache especially in indoor light, I can write pages about its worst camera performance. Rear camera works fine, no issues with that but front oneüò≠üò≠, my money just got wasted.19 Jun- By look, it is awesome, feels good in hand, light weight but I personally wanted a good camera which it doesn't have especially selfie camera, not happy with the front camera, rear camera is fine, not that bad."
5,"My first impression was overwhelming as it was a major upgrade from my last phone. It's a piece of art, the glass body and the amoled display makes feel.. Terrific.. üòÖ One thing to take extra care is the camera portion which is placed Protruding at the back . The case is of average quality. The phone is butter smooth ü§§ It's just been a few hours so hoping for the best ü§û"
5,"Awesome phone, amazing camera, better than nord, charcoal colour is looking premium, best option under 25k. Go for it."
1,"Worst mobile, dont waste your hard earn money on this pathetic device.."
5,"So far, so good. While the omission of the alert slider is baffling, everything else seems good for the price. Oxygen OS and good service of OnePlus is the saving grace, else there are better specifications out there. Buy it if software performance is your number 1 priority. Else you can get better phones from Redmi, iQoo or others."
5,Awesome phone in this price.....Camera and features is good than previous one plus nordMust buy if you don't waste extra money on nord just because of slider
1,"Waste of money, phone heats like a volcano. Will suggest all to go for other brands. Camera is also not good."
5,"First of all thanks to Amazon to deliver my phone so fast and in very good condition.I recieved my first ever OnePlus today morning.As NORD was one of the hits , I can see Nord CE is on the same way.In Box :SmartPhone with Adapter and Red Cable, super transparent case for phone and some manual stuff.Physics : Can be handle by one hand easily, nice grip , not much slim as shown but fits perfectly in hand. Feels bit weighted not as described by Oneplus.Display is AMOLeD so feels good . Response time is 0.2ms . Fingerprint Scanner works well.Software : SnapDragon 750G is preety good. Good for moderate users. UI is same as other OnePlus models so not much difference.Missing NeverSettle logo on screen.Camera quality is much better than any other phone in this price range.Front as well as rear.Sound quality is good but could have been better, I must say its very loud.Battery :Did my first charge , took 22mins approx to go 100% from 39%.Will update after 2-3 days about battery performance once I play couple of games on it.Rest depends on phone , mine is 12GB 256 GB variant so lots of space which comes with additional 5Gb bree Cloud by OnePlus can be extended to 1TB if needed.Phone is awsome in such low price range.Go for it without thinking in 25K range.Awsome wok OnePlus !! Thanks ."
1,"If you are lover of camera and fast charging, don't go for it.Battery life is good and display is also good.Speaker sound is loud and nice."
5,Great phone
5,"I have one plus six purchase in 2018. It was working fine with no issue. I always have interest on 5 G phone and this was purchase during Amazon sell. The delivery was smooth in one day. The phone has transparent cover no need to purchase any cover. The wireless data , apps, contact transfer between two android phone is so smooth , one should always try while setting the new phone ( both phone should have wifi / SIM card. The phone is much lighter , fingerprint sensor working smooth, fast browsing,  the two specific feature I want to mention , one is battery back up ( more than one day ) and another is excellent picture quality which are the main attraction. I am having I phone 11, but the picture quality is far superior. The discount I received from HDFC as well as Amazon. You may try if you want a change of handset .The photo was taken today at 6.45 PM in cloudy sky and low light . You can see the quality and judge"
1,I am using this product since last few days and found below observation-1. Worst camera in this price segment including front & rear both2. Display is just ok3. Form factor is good light weight and slim
5,"The smoothest phone I have used so far. I have used it for 2 days and I don't have any complaints on it so far.  I had used One Plus 2 for almost 5 and half years and then switched to Samsung phone, but I didn't like it. Was looking for a phone in a mid budget range, this is the best."
2,Camera quality not good
1,"Don't switch to OnePlus, it used to be a good company, but now they're also like other brands.Releasing 4-7 new phones every year without software support/updates.I was using OnePlus 7T and recently updated to the android 11, now my phone is like why you have trusted OnePlus and installed this update.They're introducing bugs to their old devices, so that their old customers should buy new OnePlus phones.I used to be a OnePlus fan, but now I'm suggesting don't buy OnePlus."
5,"Wonderful mobile ever, Great Experience Ahead."
5,Best phone this price.
5,Pros:OSDisplayCameraProcessorCons:Battery Draining5G Band support (Only 1 band)Single sim 5g standy
1,heating issueWorst phone fro one plusCamera was good
5,Super in chargeing super photo must buy it
5,"First oneplus product owned till now and I am quate Happy with mobile with respect to camera quality, features provided too. Reagarding its operating system it's very very smooth, also battery runs for a day using zoom and microsoft teams meetings."
1,"First of all this phone has degraded quality based on processor, camera, charging etc compared to other OnePlus devices including OnePlus Nord. Selfie camera is just way too pathetic.takes too much time for charging .. in short its just like all other average android phones with big price tag!!! Not much speciality of OnePlus features. Over priced!"
5,good
5,"Awesome phone, received in good packaging and well before time. Love the product and service by Amazon. Thankyou"
5,Good buy
5,Excellent üëåall are super
5,I really like the processor and the quality of camera but this phone's battery life drains much faster than the older OnePlus mobiles . Also it heats up faster than the others
5,The mobile is lightweight and feature wise it is excellent... prompt delivery by Amazon.... performance wise it is early to say but affordable and simple in operation
1,Nothing is good
4,"I like it , it's a nice phone zoom is nice not that as expected other things r good ,doesn't come with warranty card so I call the service center they said we can download it online from my orders or u can call us anytime amazon warranty card  relieved my stress , other things r good n others faults n good is time is gonna show me , that how long it last but yes its a good by the way"
1,"Battery won't last even half a day, lag and touch is ok. Weightless and it is slim. But overall no"
5,"I am writing the review after use of about 1 day. I purchased it for my mother. She is very happy to have it. Aa she was earlier user of Samsung basic mobile and she used the mobile for about 6 years. So now she upgraded to smartphone of this brand because in her opinion Samsung mobiles are long lasting. In my opinion:-  Display- 4.5/5  Battery- 5/5  Camera- 5/5  Performance- 4/5  Look- 4/5  Value for money- 4.5/5Display is good and bright as usual Samsung display are always of better quality.  Sound is not best but okay. Look is good but need improvement in back design as it seems to be a cheap plastic material. Battery has no complaints. Camera specially front camera is surprisingly good. But performance should be improved as somtime touch is less responsive.so if you are multitasker and heavy user of mobile then itz not for you. but keeping the price in mind 7299 rs for 3gb ram and 32 gb storage its a fair deal as you are attached to Samsung brand which is better than cheap chinese mobiles like Mi, Oppo, etcPlz don't forget to like if fou find my review helpful üëç"
1,performance was very bad if I open the application that time hang my phone with in 3 seconds and when I rotate the video on landscape mode that time video has slowly moved
4,"Dont expect much from this phone, this is a average user phone, phone will be  lag if using more apps, but its decent for this price, value for money.  Best for Basic to Android upgraders."
1,"I ordered the phone as soon as it was launched. When I received the phone, the camera was not working properly. Everything was very blurry and phone was very slow.I placed a return request. I then received the replacement piece. Camera was working this time but after 1 day use, I noticed that nobody called me the whole day when I generally receive around 10 calls. When I tried calling from another number, it said that the number is out of coverage area when jio had good network reception and VoLTE was on. I have a placed a return request for second time now."
5,"Why did i purchased?1.For using wifi hotspot, instead of my primary phone2.To make or receive Emergency calls either from office or other personalsWhat did i liked most?1.Good Build quality2.Good Display, excellent quality3.Good signal reception, clear voice quality.4.economy price.5.Good Battery6.Latest operation system.7.Dolby atmos(good for music lovers)8.hotspotWhat makes you disappoint?Usb port should be ctype.Finally, what did you say?This is the excellent phone in this price range.Can be used as wifi hotspot and standby phone.This phone is only for basic usage like listening music, simple  voice calls, chatting, watching youtube, surfing net.Not recommended for gamers and heavy users.And display supports upto 720p only.Note:In initial setup, you may face lag and struck in youtube videos. But once after setup completed,restart  the phone.Everything  will get settled up."
3,"Update- so I have been using it for months now, get a scratch guard, screen can get easily scratched, about the performance, man it's disappointing, it soo laggy opening and closing tabs etc, I got a software update for Android 11 a week ago while other phones are getting 12, it is said this too is confirmed for Android 12, camera/video recording is fine or even good, guess this is the only phone in minimum price range with a macro camera, 2mp, should be atleast 3.2mp man..speaker is loud and nice, screen sharpness/colours too is good considering it's not amoLED. Very very laggy, will often get typo errors etc.Final verdict- if on a budget, or don't really care about using a phone and using it just for the sake of it(like me), then go for it, but lag/slow performance is an issue, though a tad bit better on 11, hope performance is better on Android 12.So I recieved the phone a few days back. And I will be using this phone as my primary phone. So I will keep this brief and almost to the point.Build quality- tacky looking, good, but can be improved for future budget phones. I got grey color, and it's not metallic, my mum says the rear looks like shahbadi floor tiles. Not an insult. Anyways I like it, but it's not metallic.Screen- personally, I am happy with it, touch feedback is nice too, but ofcourse not like 20k+ range phones.touch is very responsive in the calculator app.Battery- well 5000mah, good, it's quite more than necessary for me but good.Camera- macro camera- took a fair enough macro shot, 2mp. 3.2mp would have been a sweet spot in budget yet good quality. Front and main camera yet to test fully. Night time photos? Forget it. Honestly even most mid range phones don't fare well in night.Processor power- its not a powerful chip to begin with, but fine, I am going to manage with it. For others, the phone is a bit laggy/slow in some aspects..or most. Camera takes a good whole second or 2 to start, the viewfinder flow is not smooth and laggy/glitchy.but I like the wide and macro combination. SHOULD'VE BEEN 3.2MP :'(More apps= bit more lag while entering main menu. So the less no of apps, should suffice. I opened a bunch of apps, including 3 Google tabs in browser, and many apps, lag was not severe slowdown, but was a little slower than before or it's slow to begin with and didn't really have high expectations. Using the device care and/or restarting the phone did feel better and smoother, but took a good whole 7 to 10 seconds for the live wallpaper to load. Talking of wallpapers, even being samsing OneUI, there is no option for galaxy themes :(I am not gonna do any major gaming on this so I cannot say anything on it's regard, I prefer pc gaming. But don't expect much, however if you really want have a  experience where you'd feel better/happy with the purchase, I'd suggest playing classic games like Mario, crash bandicoot etc. Some game suggestions- Dadish, alto.I will update this review after a week/months use. And finally a half/full year update.If you have a budget of atleast 10k then I'd suggest buying some other samsung product or your preference. I've used the m31s and compared to this, that phone is way smooth, and many more models out there. But if you want a entry level phone, or coming from a feature phone, budget constraints, secondary phone. Then this is the phone to go with.  I personally like my m02 quite a bit."
1,"Phone is very slow& heats up quickly. I replace the first piece. Received the replacement the very next day, thanks to amazon. But the second handset was even worse as it got extremely heated even before it was set up completely. Returning it also."
1,"No wireless display as specified and camera not working evertime, quality is poor, even though 13mpixel, it's like VGA camera.. pictures are blur..please don't waste your money.."
4,"Mobile is good for simple use but pathetic camera , no fingerprint sensor and old processor which makes it slow for a phone in 2021 .  I purchased it as my secondry phone, display is really awesome and light weight with sleek design. For better deal opt for micromax IN 1B if you can compromise on display and will use as primary phone  .But the conclusion is samsung's quality and customer care cannot be compared with any other brand  in india .If you want a secondry phone then its a perfect choice at this price"
5,"At a first glance phone looks decent one. It has almost all the features except finger print but it's ok in this price range. Checked the sound quality, camera, internet speed. All seems to be fine. For a basic user it's a good choice. Will review further after using few more days."
3,Average Smartphone.....üòµ
5,The product is best value for money and only watch it as a budget smartphone
1,Performance and display is not as per standard. Pale display....it looka like a duplicate screen. Performance is so slow that even opening a calculator take 5sec of lag to open. It seems this phn is either refurbished version of some older phone. Samsung has not delivered such low standard phn till now.
1,"Reason to buy :1. Very stylish looks . u found a premium quality.2. Big display.3. Battery is good.Reason not to buy1. It's like a Scorpio with auto""s engine.App load time is long2. Camara just a scrap.3. Speaker is very very bad. Burst speaker.Over all don't buy this . if you don't want anything more than call nd need only a good looking ph then only buy or either go for poco c3,redmi 9a"
1,I have used 3 or 4 samsung phones with this price tag. But this phone model is disappointing me.I found below issues in the phone that i received from this seller. Not sure about other users.1. Call volume is low.2. Performance issue.3. Phone hangs in the middle without loading the website completely.4. Very heavy but ( i did not notice it when i ordered. This is my mistake).5. Call disconnection but not very frequently.There is no option for refund. But it has only exchange with the same model.I returned this mobile . Am waiting for replacement phone. Let us see how the new phone of same model works.
2,Good in screen size. Average phone in the price range. üëçCamera üì∑ worst-: On the name of samsung it's very bad. üëéBatteryüîãbackup-: It's is good can run full day.üëçSpeed~RAM-: Don't even think of playing any game. It's lag vere very much even while playing Temple Run in 3gb variant.üëéMemory management-: it's come with 32gb internal memory in with 10gb is allready consume by system software.üëéOverall ~ If you are purchasing this phone for only calling purpose then go for it. üëçDon't think of playing a single 50-100Mb game u won't be able to play on this device üôè
1,"Guys if you are looking for a smartphone Please do not buy this product. Reasons are given below1. Battery life is not upto the Mark even in power saving mode. Drained very fast in just 15 hrs. If you watch movie then ot will drain in 4 hrs only.2. Camera. Both front and rear camera are just like vga camera. No quality of Megapixels.3. Hangs a lot. Takes too much to unlock and don't have a fingerprint scanner as well. No facelock option.4. Many times it dont show the caller number on screen for 5 to 10 seconds.When you are working on it and someone calls you then only ringtone will play first and small icon will appear on the top after 5-10 seconds. Unknown no. by truecaller will show when you disconnect call.5. I have not installed any game as it hangs in normal operation.6. Screen width is not upto mark,as keys of keyboard come closer. You will feel uncomfortable while typing.7. Sound quality is low, as no proper music beats.8. When you are on call the screen automatically flash and touch enables.Samsung should recall this model. Worst ever phone. You can add 2000 more and can get better phone than this."
3,"Writing this review after couple of days of using. First I ordered this and received a slow item, then I replaced the item and thanks to Amazon I have received the replacement within 1 day. But, the replacement item is still slow. Hence, I have decided to return the item.PROS:1. Big Screen2. Huge Battery Life3. 3GB of RAM4. 32GB of Internal Storage6. Latest Android OSCONS:1. MediaTek Processor (after having 3GB of RAM, the phone takes 2 seconds to open Chrome and 1.5 seconds to open contact list)2. Hangs After Playing GamesVERDICT:You can go for this phone if you are looking for a secondary phone or you are gifting this to your parents. This phone is not for them who will watch movies, play games and hinging on social media apps."
1,"First I was happy that Samsung rolled out a budget phone under 7000 Rs. but later got disappointed that we have to bear slow processor. The processor is quite slow and the phone started hanging as soon as I booted for the very first time. Along with this drawback, the display is very cheap when it comes to expecting a nice one from a brand like Samsung. I would suggest not to go with the brand value but see the specifications before you buy and don't make the mistake which I made."
5,* Display is very good* Battery Backup Excellent* Stylish Mobile* YouTube Videos playing without buffering
2,"Phone is little bit slow hanging in first start , below average camera quality both front and rear , plastic back but at this price point cant expect more. But we can expect good Qualcomm Snapdragon processor or exynos ...long charger wirePros - good battery not yet checked , bright and clear screen, latest update today via OTA,Cons- very small charger wire and it is unacceptable, below average camera, very slow phone , plastic cheap quality,I suggest spend bit more on good specification phone don't just go with Samsung..."
1,Defective Item was received.IMEI number is not displaying when dialing the required number.Requested for a refund but exchange partner has refused to collect it despite raising a request within 24 hours.Please check the seller on Amazon before purchasing your products.
2,"I would not recommend this product to any age group.This mobile has most slowest processor, even on first day you feel like you are operating crashed system.Go for bit higher prise product you Will not regret."
1,Pathetic performance of the phone. My father in law was using old redmi 3i for past many years. Since it's battery was almost gone i bought this useless mobile with weakest processor. Opening a dialer itself takes 3-4 seconds. I didn't imagine this like sluggishness of the mobile from Samsung. Better i would've gone with xiomi or realme. Wasted Rs.7500.. lets see how long will it work
5,"If we compare the product quality with the price, definitely it is a value for money device for your daily usage.Battery life is very good, charging is a bit slow but ok.Look wise the phone gives a decent look from back side which can be increased by using back cover.Front side look is awsm.Screen size is good for gaming and movies, performance is great even in sunlight.Camera quality is absolutely fine.Definitely you can go for this having a branded logo on back."
4,Product is just ok if you have another phone. I use iPhone n I took it as some apps have xtra features in android.Phone has a good battery. Processor is not good enough so it‚Äôs a little slagging. Design is good. Display is too bright if u hold it straight with ur eyes as it‚Äôs a tft lcd.  I hope in future updates mobile will become a little smoother.  It is very rare that you will get every update time to time in this price. But I am sure u r not going to get a better choice in this price. If you have money shortcomings you can consider it!!Have a nice day ahead!!
1,Believe me guys don't make mistake you will regret. This phone hangs a lot even at normal task like opening notification panel or settings or receiving calls. Better go for other brands if you are tight with your budget they buy new Gionee phones Gionee F103 pro was my first phone there are some software update problem but except that everything runs much smoother than this M02 and note it this Gionee phone was 5 years old and still you can play COD in it. Even i have played pubg recently before it was ban. Now i ordered new mobile because i was getting battery issue in my Gionee handset and trusted Samsung but i got something more bad than previous phone.Don't buy it!
5,"Best smartphone in this prize,nice display, battery life best,but I want to more features like, screen shot and screen recorder too."
4,"This is my first personal Samsung phone, and what better model to start with! Using it for a week  now and everything is functioning as it should. Very good display, sound and maneuverability overall.  Only one thing :  The mobile's data cable could really have been a bit longer. Other than that the phone is working fine. The best thing is the 5000mAH battery,  which I am enjoying. :-) Truly  a value for money.Will update if I find any other significant matter in the coming days."
1,"Don't buy this phone,This phone has a very low processors if you want to this you can buy the redimi phones it will better than samsung,Processors has a lots of stuck whenever using the Samsung m02 they will hang automatically without any work ,Samusung has a bad customer support this company has a very bad service don't go Janakpuri service centre QDIGI SAMSUNG AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTRE THEY ARE CREATING A MONEY"
4,"3/32gb variant @ 7299/- is good deal with samsung brand. Quad-core MediaTek MT6739 Processor is outdated & slow but adequate for basic usage. No lagging for whatsApp, fb, YouTube.  Display & Screen resolution is great as well as battery backup. 10W charger took more than 3.5hr for full charging. Cameras are average considering price point."
5,Best samsung mobile in this price category.Thank you Amazon.
2,I ONLY USE FOR MAKING CALLS.WHATSAPP VIDEOS ONE OR TWO I SEE AT THE MAXIMUM.MOBILE LOOKS GOOD.NO ONE CAN TALK ILL ABOUT SAMSUNG DISPLAY OR CAMERA.AS USUAL BATTERY FAILS.IN THIS CASE ATTERY DRAINS EVERYDAY I NEED TO CHARGE EVENTHOUGH I DIDNOT PLAY ANY GAME OR SEE MEDIA.IF WE PUT FULL CHARGE ATLEAST IT SHOULD LAST FOR ONE FULL DAY.MORNING IF IT IS 100 PERCENT EVENING IT COMES AROUND 35 PERCENT.CURSE FOR SAMSUNG.
1,"Very bad phone,not worthy .no finger print no face unlock it's very lacks of features phone and  if compare with any other same range phone which are having all features in low price but this phone has nothing. Not a single latest feature available in this phone so I will suggest don't buy this phone."
1,"I purchased this for my DAD, delivered to my hometown address. The problems were started on 4th day of delivery date, unfortunate is that my dad informed on 8th day of delivery date ( he is trying to set this with his friends, thought that might be it is configuration issue). We lost the chance to return this mobile - return window was closed in 7 days.Hoping  for best for the solution at service center palakollu. WG Dist. i post next update.I recommend not to buy this mobile. go for better one + spending 2 to 4k more..."
4,"Would go for 3.5/5 overall rating.This is a good budget buy for someone who uses mobile for basic uses such as phone, whatsapp, FB, Youtube Videos,..Not meant for some intense usage. (Gaming, Photography, etc.)3+32 GB @ ‚Çπ 6200 after discount was a gr8 deal.(Prefer Samsung/Nokia/ any other Indian brands over the Chinese anyday, anytime. #Boycottchinesemade)"
1,Very slow and laggy even after closing all apps and uninstalling all the unwanted apps. Struggles to even open youtube and start playing a video. Hangs when scrolling
5,Just amazing..Battery back up to video quality as well as net working and perform too fast..
5,A wonderful value for money! I had asked it as a extra side phone. It provides excellent prolonged battery life and beautiful design that doesn't get you off. The performance is obviously not as fast as premium phones in terms of speed if you want to use as a multi purpose phone. But basic apps just do all fine.
4,"I am writing  this  review  after  use of  10 days .Display  is  good.  Camara also good. Battery life is also good. Display  appears is good. Back cover is cheap plastic one. Touch isn't good enough.But  I like Samsung  mobiles, I  have S9 and  S20 fe 5g also.The most disappointing  thing  is  it has  not  C type  charging  .My wife is confused  about  charger  insert  it correct  side.Overall ferpormance good.My opinion  is 4/5."
4,"If you are buying for parents, a big NO to this product. It has lot of bloat apps, unwanted popup notifications of apps.Young users with no game play okeyPros:‚Ä¢Finger print sensor at this price range 6.7k. Awsome‚Ä¢Quick response of finger sensor.‚Ä¢Battery 5000mah‚Ä¢Android Go editionCons:‚Ä¢Micro USB slot, it should be USB C type now.‚Ä¢ pre installed apps, Bloatware, notifications like Redmi phones‚Ä¢charging takes a lot of time almost 3+ hours‚Ä¢Picture quality not great as compared to other phone at this price range.‚Ä¢Speaker sound is like twitter sound, no base‚Ä¢Plastic body‚Ä¢No phone cover included like other brands give now a days|| Overall good at this price range with finger print sensor.Android Go is a plus factor.|| Reccomendations go for other brands if budget greater than 7k."
5,Very nice
5,"Nice phone bought on introductory price of Rs.6600/-.Satisfactory display,long lasting battery, quick fingerprint sensor, enough brightness but comes with time cconsuming battery charger.Overall nice experience with cheaper phone."
3,Battery life is good. Display quality also good but finger print sensor can't detect finger print. There are so many  unuseful apps which can't be uninstalled.
4,Good Phone And the best it is manufactured in India. So I believe it will work well in future
3,Nice phone with good camera quality but charging speed is too slow....But best phone at this price üëçüëçüëç
4,Camera and battery backup
1,It take four hour to charge phone and during call if I on speaker then voice echo on others phone
4,No sim inject tool because back is removable then insert sim.No type c cable.Camera is good in this segmentFinger print is quit faster.
5,Very good and nice product.
4,Che mara problem
5,Very good product in this price range
4,Good servicebut there was no physical bill in package
3,I did like battery life. I did not like cam. Went blank one day ... Didn't start. Came back on the other day.
4,Value of money super
1,"In warranty card, mentioned headset but not provided??.."
3,Product is good according to the price range but is little bit low and display quality is good.

4,The best part of the phone is it's super simple and user friendly operating system. Camera doesn't oversaturate colours and captures decent photos. Battery charging is super fast. People argue that this is overpriced in this segment but I guess ease of using the phone and mainly the OS wouldn't be so good in other comparable phones. It is super light and handy.Edit: taking away 1 star from the review after a month's usage.Phone app lags all the time. Phone starts ringing when I receive a call while the name of caller appears 5 seconds later. This is very annoying. Similar issue while calling. Hope some software update fixes this issue.
1,Phone looks good but features are 10k phoneCamera is worstPerformance is not goodI recommend to go like vivo or oppo
5,"Performance is really good - no lags at allPerfectly smooth user experience.COD gaming - quality medium, frame rate max - fps 57-60.Quality high, max frame rate - fps - 45-58Battery easily lasts more than one day with 1 hour gaming and 2-3 hours YouTube/Netflix etc.Super fast charging.Cameras are good too.Not as good as pixel 4a but almost 90% as good.Single speaker is a let down, but still enough loud.No ois but software stabilization is good.Overall, very satisfied with the phone.Really enjoying using the phone.Simply trust OnePlus, they know how to make good phones."
1,"23 jun-Update after using almost 4 days,Front camera sucks, I have changed my phone after 3 years and ut is 24k phone which doesn't even have nice front camera, there is too much lag in front camera, you will have to stay steady (atleast 30 secs)to have nice selfie, if you are someone who is looking to change the phone for camera then just think about it, selfie camera is going to give you headache especially in indoor light, I can write pages about its worst camera performance. Rear camera works fine, no issues with that but front oneüò≠üò≠, my money just got wasted.19 Jun- By look, it is awesome, feels good in hand, light weight but I personally wanted a good camera which it doesn't have especially selfie camera, not happy with the front camera, rear camera is fine, not that bad."
5,"My first impression was overwhelming as it was a major upgrade from my last phone. It's a piece of art, the glass body and the amoled display makes feel.. Terrific.. üòÖ One thing to take extra care is the camera portion which is placed Protruding at the back . The case is of average quality. The phone is butter smooth ü§§ It's just been a few hours so hoping for the best ü§û"
5,"Awesome phone, amazing camera, better than nord, charcoal colour is looking premium, best option under 25k. Go for it."
1,"Worst mobile, dont waste your hard earn money on this pathetic device.."
5,"So far, so good. While the omission of the alert slider is baffling, everything else seems good for the price. Oxygen OS and good service of OnePlus is the saving grace, else there are better specifications out there. Buy it if software performance is your number 1 priority. Else you can get better phones from Redmi, iQoo or others."
5,Awesome phone in this price.....Camera and features is good than previous one plus nordMust buy if you don't waste extra money on nord just because of slider
1,"Waste of money, phone heats like a volcano. Will suggest all to go for other brands. Camera is also not good."
5,"First of all thanks to Amazon to deliver my phone so fast and in very good condition.I recieved my first ever OnePlus today morning.As NORD was one of the hits , I can see Nord CE is on the same way.In Box :SmartPhone with Adapter and Red Cable, super transparent case for phone and some manual stuff.Physics : Can be handle by one hand easily, nice grip , not much slim as shown but fits perfectly in hand. Feels bit weighted not as described by Oneplus.Display is AMOLeD so feels good . Response time is 0.2ms . Fingerprint Scanner works well.Software : SnapDragon 750G is preety good. Good for moderate users. UI is same as other OnePlus models so not much difference.Missing NeverSettle logo on screen.Camera quality is much better than any other phone in this price range.Front as well as rear.Sound quality is good but could have been better, I must say its very loud.Battery :Did my first charge , took 22mins approx to go 100% from 39%.Will update after 2-3 days about battery performance once I play couple of games on it.Rest depends on phone , mine is 12GB 256 GB variant so lots of space which comes with additional 5Gb bree Cloud by OnePlus can be extended to 1TB if needed.Phone is awsome in such low price range.Go for it without thinking in 25K range.Awsome wok OnePlus !! Thanks ."
1,"If you are lover of camera and fast charging, don't go for it.Battery life is good and display is also good.Speaker sound is loud and nice."
5,Great phone
5,"I have one plus six purchase in 2018. It was working fine with no issue. I always have interest on 5 G phone and this was purchase during Amazon sell. The delivery was smooth in one day. The phone has transparent cover no need to purchase any cover. The wireless data , apps, contact transfer between two android phone is so smooth , one should always try while setting the new phone ( both phone should have wifi / SIM card. The phone is much lighter , fingerprint sensor working smooth, fast browsing,  the two specific feature I want to mention , one is battery back up ( more than one day ) and another is excellent picture quality which are the main attraction. I am having I phone 11, but the picture quality is far superior. The discount I received from HDFC as well as Amazon. You may try if you want a change of handset .The photo was taken today at 6.45 PM in cloudy sky and low light . You can see the quality and judge"
1,I am using this product since last few days and found below observation-1. Worst camera in this price segment including front & rear both2. Display is just ok3. Form factor is good light weight and slim
5,"The smoothest phone I have used so far. I have used it for 2 days and I don't have any complaints on it so far.  I had used One Plus 2 for almost 5 and half years and then switched to Samsung phone, but I didn't like it. Was looking for a phone in a mid budget range, this is the best."
2,Camera quality not good
1,"Don't switch to OnePlus, it used to be a good company, but now they're also like other brands.Releasing 4-7 new phones every year without software support/updates.I was using OnePlus 7T and recently updated to the android 11, now my phone is like why you have trusted OnePlus and installed this update.They're introducing bugs to their old devices, so that their old customers should buy new OnePlus phones.I used to be a OnePlus fan, but now I'm suggesting don't buy OnePlus."
5,"Wonderful mobile ever, Great Experience Ahead."

5,"First oneplus product owned till now and I am quate Happy with mobile with respect to camera quality, features provided too. Reagarding its operating system it's very very smooth, also battery runs for a day using zoom and microsoft teams meetings."
1,"First of all this phone has degraded quality based on processor, camera, charging etc compared to other OnePlus devices including OnePlus Nord. Selfie camera is just way too pathetic.takes too much time for charging .. in short its just like all other average android phones with big price tag!!! Not much speciality of OnePlus features. Over priced!"
5,good
5,"Awesome phone, received in good packaging and well before time. Love the product and service by Amazon. Thankyou"
5,Good buy
5,Excellent üëåall are super
5,I really like the processor and the quality of camera but this phone's battery life drains much faster than the older OnePlus mobiles . Also it heats up faster than the others
5,The mobile is lightweight and feature wise it is excellent... prompt delivery by Amazon.... performance wise it is early to say but affordable and simple in operation
1,"I am not happy buy the mobile in amazon.Whats in the box:- Handset, Earphone, USB Cable, Sim Tray Ejecter, Pre-applied Screen Protector and Protective Case, Booklet with Warranty Card and Quick Guide"

1,"Please don't buy this mobile. Waste of money. I buy this mobile before 20 days only. Now not working properly. Hanging problem, handset very slow. Please don't buy it"
5,Nice
1,There is no headphone in the box... unsatisfied üòü disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è
5,It's worth for 9.5k. after exchange offer.light weight n thin.easy to use.mobile have fingerprint n facial recognition to unlock and lifespan of battery lasts long.ram n rom are good.worth buying it.camera quality is ok.
2,"It's an average phone. Quite on the pretty side. ONLY those who are looking for a budget phone can think of purchasing this one. The camera is very average, but the functions & controls of the phone are smooth. It's very lightweight - that's a plus!"
5,Its a really very amazing and a nicely working phone..the camera quality and battery is also very goodü§©üòä.liked the product very much
1,Worst mobile . I never expect from oppo such a low grade mobile. Touch is not working. Phone hanging. No return and replacement option.  From Amazon I got bad experience. Don't buy this mobile. Waste of money.
1,It is roadside product with dusty display. When called Amazon customer care she deny to replace item. Don't buy anything from Amazon. Amazon only sells defective items. I returned many items and this was very useless response. She also disconnected call.USELESS AMAZON
1,"when i ordered this phone , headphone is free with phone but received order without headphone"
4,Nice phone value for money but in inbox there is no earphone and screen protector receive being a regular customer of Amazon i am  unhappy there was  clearly written that these items are included in inbox.
1,"Body sensor not working. Was late by 2 days to find out this defect and so could not use ""return"" option.Due to body sensor problem, phone display never gets off while talking and so when brought close to ear, buttons like mute, hold gets activated while speaking.The basic function, which is to talk to others on phone becomes troublesome. Everytime have to very careful of holding position to make sure phone is not touched on body. Hate this and feel cheated/dejected.Cannot return as well."
5,"Nice mobile prices 12,450"
3,i have recently bought this phone..on 18 may 2020.. delivery is good but there was no headphones in a box.features r awesome nd phone is working gud.but camera quality is bit bad.
1,This mobile was used by someone else.I have got someone else's mobile.I am not happy for this mobile.I will not do return this mobile.Because the reason of I give gift for other person.
5,"Oppo always exports premium quality mobiles. Let there be no such features like other mobile but i phone also doesn't export such features at high price, then?I have attached some pictures also you can check them incase you wanna see the picture quality.Hence you can buy this without any tension.Amazing mobile's camera and body quality and display is also good.Go for it I suggest. üòÉ"
1,This product received wrost.. In this item some useful applications not run..Order canceled but no cancelation status and pick up status updating by Amazon..No any contact provided by Amazon..Realy disappoint..
4,"Better to value for money , quality is as per shown ..And fast delivered by amazon."
1,Don't buy it from Amazon the return service of Amazon is very bad..disgusting they never think customer problem no one in call centre never call you return policy and service is very poor only benefit looking cite ... don't buy anything from amazon.. in future I never buy electronics items from Amazon... flipcart is most trusted than amazon
1,Earphones not received in a phone box
1,The phone lags a lot right from the box. You have to swipe 3-4 times. Apps get hung. Never seen such a pathetic phone.
2,This product details said there is a earphone and screen protector.  But i didnt get that
5,The phone is excellent but if the front and rear camara should be high and should be their dark mode compalsary but it should be added fastly and should give ear phonesonly main default is not nice camara should be high because the less cost mobiles will take more tean agers so they do moor selfies so it should increase and oppo is the selfie expert but this phone no selfie expert camara for next phone it should increase .Imay think I will increase
1,"1. Phone don't have type C charging2. Dual app not possible for all app like redmi phones3. Charger is normal 5v 2 Amp so no fast charging.4. Not for multi tasking people.5. Camera and sound average6. Processor and touch very slow7. Only 6GB RAM AND 128 GB ROM is good  in this phone.8. Also it's not showing dual 4G9. Battery is only 1 day at normal uses.10. Display dpi is also very low.11. Can be treated as entry level phone.12. WhatsApp Camera function is abnormal, don't waste money on OPPO A31"
3,"I like the product. But as compared to my other phone Realme X2. I found the lag in processing in some of minor things also. It is having 6GB RAM then also the having some processing issue. I don;t like the product. Even after this specs, the things are getting lag."
1,"Screen quality is very poor , camera is also nearly poor, all over the phone is worst. I ordered this phone by choosing the no cost emi option of Bajaj , but they are also taking the processing charges of Rs.174 on every instalment.So please don‚Äôt use Bajaj‚Äôs emi option for ordering this phone. Thanks"
1,"i have received the waste and damaged products and i chasing the customer support from last 10 days no solution upto now waste of money on  amazon ,waste of time on amazon ,and i customer of amzaon from last 5 years and i am a prime member this is the services i am getting"
3,Updating after 4month :-screen recorder not available..which is default function of every android now a days..-Charging draining faster but charging gaining very slower.-its not a 21st century phone .. so many basic features missing Day 1: experience:-Most important : it will not redirect the link into the present app in mobile .... It will open link every times in default browser..Eg: if I got any Facebook /insta /Twitter link and I already have installed these app then it will not asking me to get open with app instead it will redirect to browser and again I need to login... So so poor technology1.processor looks slow while setup and configuration my account data restoration as compare to redmi note 7 (same price older version phone than this)2. Camera quality is very low both back and front ...capture blurred images..not focusing the face even after setup manually.3.  Not value for money.. I think I made mistake to choose oppo brand .. I compare all the feature with redmi.. redmi looks far better than this..4. No front flash light available to click in night5. Looks slow to handle multiple apps compare to redmi6. Please don't buy this phone..this is so poor technology phone..
3,Headsets are missing in the phone box...where are the original headsets...its normally included in phonebox??

5,"Amazing smartphone by ""Tecno"" making its introduction in India's budget segment. The specifications does meet expectations giving complete satisfactory experience. Android HiOS allows various customisations which make functions even smarter while smooth performance. CarlCare its customer/ warranty service is also trustable in terms of after sales. I'm happy to have purchased it soon after launch. More power to you Tecno and thank you Amazon!"
5,The display and battery
5,It's awesome comparison to other brand in this price range.

5,"Very good quality phone by an Indian company. Z2 is the basic phone from LAVA Z series, it lacks finger print recognition but has face recognition. Battery life is good, comes all day for basic needs. Camera is good for this price range phone. Comes with stock android 10. If you are looking for a basic phone for your parents or kids then look no further. Go for this Indian phone.Has same configuration and features as Samsung M02 or basic Chinese phone. But faster due to stock android."
2,"1. The Dialer have no Direct Video call option available. If want to make a video call, must have to On Data first and then through others available Apps subject to the availablility of same Apps at other end also, then only possible.2. On call recording option is quite common feature for such a Smartphone, but here it is also missing.3. The device has no finger print sensor, so everytime for On the screen, have to press power button as no Voice Match Unlock are working.Here Google Go and Go Assistant is installed, but failed to configure Voice Assistant service which is a feature of Google Assistant, but not installing here also due to same type Apps (Google Go) available.4. Here is no Wakeup Gesture like ""Double Tap Wakeup"" , which is very much common is missing here."
4,Performance 5/5Battery 5/5C Type- 5/5Camera 3/5Volume 3/5Expecting more devices with in budject in future 5G Mobiles from Lava. Thank you for launched updated android v11 from lava brand and Amazon team.
1,"The phone is so nice, but I got a defective set @6629 INR.The power button was not fully working, if you press it once, the set went to shutdown instead of locking.The processor also did not work well, while watching you tube video, if a call comes, the set gets hanged. So the Mediatek processor is not up to the mark.Amazon customer care is very difficult to reach, for electronic items, a special toll free number needs to be dialled, an app needs to be installed and then convince the executive that I am not a fraudulent customer.Same holds true for the pick up executive, he needs to put off the set, which I had kept ON so diligently for 3 days in case the power button does not work. But I was lucky, the set could be made on and IMEI numbers were noted.I have rated 5 on 5 for the customer care executive and will give the same for the pickup executive.Hopefully, I will get a refund soon.I am using a Nokia C3 purchased from amazon since last 4 months and rated it 5 star."
5,"After long time lava is comeback with a excellent product, overall z2 is a fadu product,dil khush kar diya, proudly indian."
4,"The worst thing is inbuilt call recorder not available. No matter what third party app you install still call recorder won't work! Next worst thing is the OS. It is a downsized version of Android 10. Hence lot of apps won't work for your surprise. Hope Lava would listen and upgrade the OS with added features. Build quality, Display, Camera and battery backup is good."
5,"Great Indian Product * Battery 5000mAh is good * Pure android not chinese UI * Charger having two USB slot to charge two  mobile at time * Charging cable quality is good * Mobile case is also included in the package * Camera is good. * Speaker volume is high * Mobile grip is awesome with 6.5"" screen * Above all an Indian product and value for  money.I Suppport ""make in India"" and ""vocal for local"""
5,In This mobile is great battery life.. camera quality...But one Disadvantages Is not fingerprint reader..Or main advantage is Its not any extra Install apps
5,If you are looking for a budget smartphone than this is the phone for everyone.Using it since 4 months and battery is giving excellent backup. The android is of latest version.Must have for everyone who looking for decent phone for gaming and good battery backup.

5,Simple phone for switching to touchscreen. easy to use. and thus proud feeling comes for anyone who hasn't used much smartphone. The quality of the material is excellent.

5,The phone doesn't match with showing photo in uper
1,"Not given  the same model of mobile as shown in the picture, the show other phone  (Narzo 30 5g) and send narzo 30....."
5,i got my mobile in 3 days.. packing was good.. i like it
1,"I bought this phone first on 18th August, 2021. The voice quality was really bad. The voice was noisy and it would break every 2-3 seconds. So, I returned it on 23rd for a new device that arrived on 24th August. The second device also had the same issue and so I had to return it.There seems to be some issue with the latest batch. While returning/replacing the technician asks you to install an app to check for issues and it fails the check for the SIM carrier slot. So it isn't just something that I feel is wrong. I tried 2 different sims that works on other two phones that I have.So do watch out for this issue if you are thinking to buy it."
4,Review after 10 days of usage.Pros1. Amazing performance considering the price2. Nice 90hz display.3. Well optimised UI4. 30w fast charging full charge within 70mins5. Good build qualityCons1. Heats up while charging with 30w charger2. Average heat while gaming in ultra graphics ( common for all mediatek processors )3. Camera quality not that great ( may be because of performance concentrated phone )4. Ui crashed once when I turned on auto rotation.5. Touch response is some what lagy.* 4 and 5 almost solved after hard resetting the phoneVerdictGood phone for gamers considering the price. Performance beast.Camera averageHope this helps you!
2,One day late delivered.  Product is good. But courier Boy 's behavior is rude.
4,Overall a good phone camera performance is decent enough in this price point the front camera though does a great job because of sony imx471 sensor ultrawide on the back would be great the macro and b/w sensor is not that useful battery life is good for an average user iam getting a screen on time of about 45-50 minutes using 10% battery so it can give you about 8-9 hours of screen time daily the charging is powerful and charges quickly In short its a gaming phone The antutu score os this device is around 350k which is greater than redmi note 10 pro max score of 300k
1,Dear sir I saw the ads of Realme 30Narzo 5G but today my friend told me I get this mobile in 4G Model. Request to solve my problem that I get 4 G model of Realme 30 Narzo instead of 5G Model. Plz solve first time I face this things request to change 5G Model
1,Screen touch not work.buy after 5 days hang damage
1,"I regret to say that I received a defective product ..I cannot hear clearly what others speak at the other end ..the speaker is worst that I cannot recive a word clearly , and I realise the defect  after 1 week that I couldn't return the product as the return window is closed.total waste of money that I had to use other phone for calls..now I am running pillar to post to get that mobile to get repaired..regret buying this mobile really"
1,Product is good but there was no bill and warranty card inside box so disappointed with amazon
5,"I like realme , that's why I came to realme , under 15k, realme is a great  option . Realme narzo  series is a very good series by the brand. If you're looking for a perfect and all rounder phone under 15k then defiantly go for it.Here are some reasons from my point of view why you should go for it.. read till the end , and yeah I'm not a realme employee, this is what think of it1) beautiful desigine  desigine is awesome,  shiny but pringer print problem .plastic back so, please use it with the cover , the cover is perfectly build, it'll not let the phone break easily2) camera Cmaera is a very important part. But realme again proved that they offer better camera than any other brands in that price range.. The photos are very sharp and very very clear detailed . For video mode , there is 4k option and video stabilisation works good . The punch hole selfi camera looks pretty and attractive , and I think the front camera is better than the rear camera set-up. over all Camera is impressive3)Performance  it is powered by helio G95 gaming prosser , which is a very powerful prosser,  and without any heating and lagging issue , you can enjoy your game for almost continuous 2-3 hrs. For normal usage it is powerful enough4) let's talk about the display.  LCD display not AMOLED bt good and bright enough. 90hz refresh rate and 6.5ince display literally offers you a great experience5) about our multimedia experience.  mono speakers, bt loud enough,  3.5mm audio head phone jack is here , noise cancellation system is missing. With a big display and loud microphone,  multimedia experience is pretty good7) Now the battery.  Its a massive  5000 mah battery which is enough for a whole day backup with heavy use too. U can charge fast , so don't worry8) one of the main part of this review,  the charging part.  It contains a 30W dart charger, which can fully charge the phone easily in about 1hr 10-12 minutes. Very fast charging,  I was surprised when it charged the phone 7% in just 2 minutes. Belive me you'll not disappointed with the charging speed9) about biometric security part.  Sidemounted fingerprint sensor is very very fast,you just have to touch the sensor and it'll instantly unlock the phone in just a mili second. Face unlock technology is also pretty fast, even in low light,  it works great10) inhand feel  Inhand fell is very perfect,  it is not too heavy and not too light, over all experience is quite good11) Connectivity  It is said that it supports 4G+ bt I've not got 4G+ yet. It depends on many factors too.. let see what happens but still downloading and uploading speed is pretty good12)the UI  Like the prosser,  we should know about the UI too, because this the main part which gives u different using experience in different phones. Personally colour OS is my favorite,  and realme UI is much similar to it. Realme UI 2.0 is such a amazing UI with the new personalised option in the settings..u can set ur phone in your own intrest13) I got the phone yesterday and today ,  I got a new security update , therefore updates are regular.. epic !15) the conclusion If you're still reading this review then thank u so much ü§óOverall  this is a all rounder budget phone in such a low price, if ur looking for a phone under 14-15k then definitely go for it. This is the perfect one. Believe me, you'll not disappointed.. you can blindly invest your money here..Thanks for reading my review... have a great day üòÄüòä"

5,All the things are nice. Only macro camera is not powerful. Good product go for it.Gprgeous.And the charger is also very heavy.Delivery boy is very good.After one days use the product earphone buck have a fault
2,Headset missing in the box
1,I got a new mobile phone realme narzo 30. Box inside hand set noo..but box list product mentioned handset.
3,"Mobile is different just as shown on picture, front path is okay but back path the camera design is different"
5,It was nice phone. But you can only enable the call recording of unknown calls only. And this will be speakable before receiving the call of unknown person. It should be improved. Overall great experience with this phone. Camera and processor. I was thinking it will hang. But really great phone. No hanging. Smooth scrolling and downloading speed was too good. Thank u narzo team. there is one mistake by seller. i bought it 6gb ram and rom 128gb it shows the back camera of 5g real me but 6b narzo 30 is same like with 4b ram
1,"Narzo is the biggest mistake, I was a fan of realme but narzo broke the illusion.While calling the voice is listening like broken inbetween both in micro phone and speaker.User can hear my voice but I can't hear them clearly.First I thought it's a network issue, but later I realised that my sim network is perfect and working fine in other phone.Then I returned this cheap quality products.Thanks to Amazon atleast they listen to customer."
5,"Compact, stylish, and good performance"
5,Good pictureüñºÔ∏è
4,Good gaming phone....I recommend u ..
1,"Your item is not like, what you have seen in photos of mobile completely different of back side"
5,Good processor good battery fast charging
1,"Camara very poor like 1.5mpVery poor quality deliver different phone but image show different , camara is very poor I give 0 star bery bad quality don't buy this phone waste hard earn money. No any option 0 star. Sound quality very poor."
1,Bad product.not same product delivered.very poor quality.i rated this Amazon delivery product 0..
4,"I'm a kind of smart phone user with following primary requirements:1. Social media2. Stock trading3. Watching moviesConsidering this and after a lot of research in social platforms , finally I fixed on narzo 30 which I thought is best value for money in this budget (around 15k).As many reviews tells, camera is just average which I don't bother about much.Though I don't do gaming, this phone I believe is good in that .I haven't felt any heating problem after 10 days.Now one thing I DIDN'T LIKE about:The charger cable is too short. Now I have to buy a extension cable to use in my room.I don't understand why the company had to save money on this."
5,Nice display.camera awesome Super battery totally Nice phone üì±
1,It's not a good buy. we all use phone primarily for calling purpose and the phone has very poor audio quality. The signal keeps breaking. Tried with two sim. The quality of sound when called through the other phone is perfect.
1,"Wanted to return the product for which Amazon scheduled an appointment with a technician who was supposed to come and check, the technician didn't turn up during the time slot  and the return time is also over and there in no information of any details about the technician visit in the website.Got a broken hand set from Amazon"
4,Nice product same as shown... front camera is amazing just back camera is not that good as expected but in this price range it's good to buy.. thanks amazon
5,Realme Narzo as always it just rocks. I jave been using it from past 12 days and till date I am not having any complaints. Its performance battery life proccessor its storage camera everything is just perfect.Only its quite heavy from other phones but still I would give it a big thumbs up!!!This is first time I have bought a realme phone was stressed out how it will be but thankfully its the best.I would suggest everyone who wants a phone in this budget can easily go with it. It won't upset you.
4,Note: Above image shown by amazon is mismatched. Narzo 30 is the mobile not narzo 30 5g. Images are incorrect not the content.Pros:G95 A powerful processor90hz Display with good battery life.30watt Charger (Fullcharge in an hour)Cons:Fingerprint not recognising often i need to tap twice or thrice.(Can fix with update)Average camera.Verdict:According to the price point no phone is near to its performance blazing smooth. Sound quality is fine for the price. Battery performancing well. Overall this is a good phone & value for money.Bought twice one for me & another for my brother.Variant: 6gb 128gb for 12500 on offer.
1,"At the time of booking realme narzo 30 racing sliver 6gb 128gb storage it shows back side 4 camares but when it delivered it has 3 cameras, Amzon person said realme no making narzo30 with 4camers, I have attached first photo which was I had seen and another which I have received......Feeling Cheat"
5,"Pros:-Really powerfull and efficient processor.All day battery if u don't game with atleast more than 8hours of screen on time and still left with some battery.Really nice 90hz display.Capable camera hardware and so to fully utilise it's capabilities try nikita gcam.The custom android skin is good, comes but just the right amount of customisation and a lot less bloatware than MIUI.The speaker provides loud and crispy sound and the earpiece clarity and loudness is also good. I think if realme wants they can enable stereo speaker on this device cause the earpiece is quite loud.Cons:-Not good enough camera software.No haptic feedback, the vibrator doesn't do a good job while typing.Lack of NFC.No secondary microphone.Other than the main camera the rest of the 2 camera module are useless, would've preferred a wide angle instead of a depth sensor.The fingerprint sensor is small so sometimes it doesn't register the finger in the first couple of tried and even the software doesn't allows the user to add a second print of the same finger so that the user can add a different part of the finger for better read.Conclusion, if you want a really phone of day to day use, this device is a good choice."
5,I hav a special thanks for Amazon for taking tis product by debit card EMI. Wer as no other sites r not allow for tis. Ter is a option for purchase but its not working. Only Amazon hav the capability to satisfy all the customer.
5,"Apart from the looks, sometimes it feels like you are using a more expensive phone. It's fast, smooth, lasts long, has a nice crisp display and isn't that heavy. Clearly, this is a power user friendly phoneRealme UI has been working well too, and the camera has been decent too. Nothing extraordinary, closer to average, but good for the price.The biggest con I can think of is the software update schedule. I don't think this is going to get the latest updates fast, or even get them for long."
1,i purchased a mobile narjo 30 5g with 4 camera set upbut i got wrong product and i returend it after that amajon sand my money in amajon wallet that is un useable for melastly i have no option to recover the money so i have only option to purchase that product only....that is horreble from amajon
5,"All rounder phone in this price range....Battery backup is good and it supports fast charging, camera quality is too good, side mounted  finger print sensor works quickyly, No lag in gaming, 90hz refresh rate, very smooth touch. At last i would say that go for it. its the best phone in this price range in day to day life."
1,Don‚Äôt buy this product .Image quality is below average comparing with the specification. Useless camera.And there is NO RETURN POLICY and replacing with same mobile is big headache .DON‚ÄôT buy this mobile
4,"Let‚Äôs make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve ‚Äî the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in ‚Äî the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricingüá©¬†üá™¬†üá∏¬†üáÆ¬†üá¨¬†üá≥¬†Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I‚Äôd still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What‚Äôs more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn‚Äôt strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.üá©¬†üáÆ¬†üá∏¬†üáµ¬†üá±¬†üá¶¬†üáæ¬†The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it‚Äôs large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it‚Äôs an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it‚Äôs just not bright enough.üÖ±üÖ∞üÜÉüÜÉüÖ¥üÜÅüÜàThe battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow ‚Äî the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?üÖ≤üÖ∞üÖºüÖ¥üÜÅüÖ∞There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There‚Äôs an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps."
5,Awesome
1,"Very bad experience from Amazon. Very bad camera quality of the phone. I want to return the phone, but amazon is not taking back the phone. I don't want to purchase any product from amazon further. Leaving amazon app permanently"
5,Best buy at this price! The display quality is amazing and I do not have any complaint with the camera too. There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.

1,This phone is not value for moneyIts a downgraded phone of earlier phone launched in india.The camera is worst i ever seen in any redmi phone.Battery is ok.The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.Dot notch display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera.Recently i am using redmi note 5 pro. And this phone is just downgraded phone by redmi .you cannot imagine low light photography in this phone.The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 prime.

1,"It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use.

3,"Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware.

2,I was having Samsung before same 4gb ram and battery back was very good but in redmi with out much of space or app ram speed is very very slow and battery back up draing with a day so not happy with the redmi product .I can return to Amazon with in 7 days but unfortunately our building is effected with covid possiitive so totally issulated no one should have contact with us so can't able to send the return mobile
3,"Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware. Unauthorised data transfer to China.If possible go for Motorola E7 around the same price and you will have great experience with Snapdragon and clean android experience."
3,Charging Adapter came with phone turned out to be defective. stopped working after 2 weeks of purchase.Don't know how to return the adapter or how to claim the warranty on adapter alone.Phone is working fine so far and looks good
4,This  product is so good
4,"Overall build and the finish is very nice , camera is good for a 10k smartphone , os is all Google based which isn't very great , useable storage is 17gb and rear camera can't focus on things quickly enough"
3,"Overall design, finishing are fine,  but camera quality as per mega pixels given is too poor."
1,"This Phone had networking and call dropping issue. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not a returnable product, which is a good tactics by Amazon or seller. They arranged for technician to check mobile who never turned up and kept rescheduling. Would recommend not to go this product or with items that are marked as only replacement. Amazon would least bother to help you to get this replaced and don‚Äôt think a customer would be happy to own a damaged product."
5,Could have been better if the finger print reader placed on screen or else back of the mobile. Because I use a mobile pouch its really uncomfortable to unlock using finger print. Other than that mobile is too good.
5,Very good phone battery and display lovely thank you Amazon
4,If you're looking a phone for normal usage then go for this model.*I bought 3/32 so it's for light gaming only*The design is so good and it's bigger than normal 10K phones*Fingerprint reader on power button is quicker compared to back mounted reader*Camera quality is OK*Battery backup is excellent*Charging takes time with provided power brick
2,It was no cost EMI...andI've been charged for 118/- emi process...Phone is quite good but I don't recommend...First ring.. doesn't goAfter second time... it's ringing...I don't know what's the problem...I bought this for my cousin...so don't know much..but he was facing this kind of issue..May be more...
2,"After observation period for 24 hours.I want to return it bcoz battery condition is consistently poor, but Amazon return policy is very tough on mobile item. I am frustrated and unable to return it.Ahh!I will never buy again these items. Thanks and sorry"
5,After 10 days my  review 2 days battery life thanks vivo and amazon

5,All OK but it's very irritating no earphone including box why do like this if any Mobile show room vivo mobiles are including ear phone only but in this amazon no ear phones it's to much I didn't like this amazon
3,Build quality bad
5,"Slim n long piece, good battery life, fast accessible, fast charging, nice camera. But finger accessible is not ease of access"

2,Hey guys the product quantity is good but the camera is not good . Pictures come blur . Rest everything is good.
5,Looks killer üëç

4,Satisfactory
5,Nice phone camera quality good Thanks Amazon
4,Nice phone but camera quality is not good charging is slow but compared to all brands vivo phone's are best

4,Nice machine
1,Total aaisa kharb karna hai  sirf koi storez nahi hai  hang bhi hota hai 1 month bhi nahi chala
5,"Good battery life, performance also good. Worth money"
5,This phone is best if you love to click pictures and has a very good screen display sound system is also very nice and colour combination is perfectvalue of money
5,Good phone in this price rate.i am using for two days. Thank you Amazon for fast dilvery.
2,Battery is slowly charging better is main problem full charge will take 11hr and 30mins to charge full battery can anyone Help is it Correct
1,The phone is not working and we also dont have any return policy here
1,"The phone is good in looks but its camera, seriously, I mean why they are costing too much if product is not so good. Don't go for it."
4,Good Quality
5,This is one of the best mobile in only this much priceYou must buy it ..
4,"Visit a store, you may get it cheaper. I bought it at 17,400 last Sunday. Product looks good with compact design. Good luck shoppers!!"
3,"The phone seems to be sleek and less in weight. The camera quality is very good. However, touch has some issues. Not able to send GIF files. I don't know the reason but there is a problem with forwarding or sharing any files. When I try to forward any files in Whatsapp, it is not getting forwarded and showing Retry button. Touch is also has got some issues. Overall the phone seems to be okay but not extraordinary as I thought about."
5,Great mobile with light weight
2,"If you are a Samsung fan and want a device from Samsung then please go with M32 (6/128 Gb) variant or F22. Those two devices are much more meaningful. Apart from OIS, this phone has nothing better than those two devices rather this Device fall short in display, speaker and charging. Still it's priced higher in the name of A series phone. A dumb phone."
4,"Excellent screen! Good battery life! 48 MP primary camera sensor has OIS and takes excellent photos! Colour saturation is slightly on a higher side nevertheless, the photos come out good!Pro mode is limited! Although 10x digital zoom, up to 4x is decent and usable. Selfie camera has a group selfie feature which covers wider frame and pretty useful. Portrait mode is pretty good too! Wide angle and macro sensors are average.Unwanted apps are preloaded, however could be uninstalled or disabled. This phone will get 2 major OS version upgrades and 3 years of security updates (quarterly).Overall a well packaged phone. 48 MP OIS sensor and sAMOLED screen are highlight of this phone!"
5,"Best phone @ this price range A series always have classy look. Camera and battery performance were good, Faster delivery. Overall worth for buying a Samsung Smartphone."
5,"Well it's a just a classy phone at a good price. Except for the huge screens( which the manufacturers can't seem to shrugg off) the phone is just amaze. I am sure will find more specced phones for the same prize. But this is a sweet mixture of an amazing UI, good screen, good battery, OIS video, okish camera , goood built making this a pleasant experience to use and to hold."
5,I've had A50s earlier. But A22 battery is definitely for my needs. And it's more robust with excellent Value for my Money.
3,Battery life is good n light weight phone
5,I like the slim mobile. It is very much convenient to use and has all required default apps.
5,No problem so far! Love it.
4,Nice
5,"Got it in exchange of old phone worth ‚Çπ2300, that made it a super deal of‚Çπ16200. It's a fantastic phone... My daughter is very happy to have it. It's very light weight and beautiful phone. And we are loyal fans of samsung. Never been disappointed. And last.. But not the least.. appario gives to blind confidence to buy from them. Such a lovely seller. Old phone was in very good condition, but still I was scared... That they might say anything about charger or phone's box or anything... If they would want to reject it. But pleasently... The guy took the phone only... And didn't even ask for charger.... Forget other accessories. This phone is very high in demand these days... And truly worth."
4,Finger print side type we didn't expect.ottherwise it's ok
3,I recently bought Galaxy A22 phone from Amazon.  received the phone. Good Amazon delivery. Started using it. Two problems cropped up. SD card is not detected.  After few days Ino calls were received.  I called Samsung.  A guy told how to receive calls. He said he will send a person to rectify SD card issue. But nobody came. Highly Disappointed with the product
2,No good sound quality. Having issue during call setup. Not worth for price
5,Within this price range  galaxy A22 is fine.Battery backup is ok.Light weight mobile easy to handle.
5,"Overall the product is very good. Looks, smoothness, touch ooeratios, sound clarity, screen resolution, camera are up to mark for a normal user like me.Only thing I am facing is while putting pass code in the Google pay the key board numbers are appearing half hidden in their position"
4,"Camera is good, all features are as per the described details and giving expected results.Battery life is super, I am using it since last 2 month, it's giving 2 days backup with heavy use.Performance speed is also nice.Only the cons. is its network connectivity slips resulting voice cracking, call muting difficulty in call merging. I tried multiple operator but same kind of issue."
3,Liked:1. Side finger sensor.2. CameraDislikes1. Processor2. Not smooth3. Not worth the money paid
4,Works fine so far. The battery doesn't need to be charged daily and the camera is pretty good.
2,I love it. Compact n well design. Only problem is secured folder(knox security) and AR doodle are missing. I called CC they said they will fixed it..
4,„Äãpremium look in decent price„Äãgood for BGMI bcz of 6gb RAM„Äãfeeling better [Rich] bcz  128gb storage„Äãcamera is decent üëå ..  _.
5,Nice print. Bought for my mother and she liked it.
2,"Mobile quality not up to the mark. Value of mobile higher side as compare market brands. Camera average,  Battery Average, device speed was slow."
5,Very good battery life fast charging big display
5,"Samsung is the bestSamsung A22 (not the 5G version) is a very good phone for non-gamers.Camera is quite good for a below 20k phone. You can't expect an Apple i-phone camera quality in this budget.Battery quality is also very good for a moderate usage.The phone is light-weight and I like its looks. Specially the mint colour version looks very elegant.Moreover, if you are a non- gamer, and a moderate user, then you can choose this phone.I am writing this review after a 8 Day's usage."
5,Excellent  phone with the minimum  price! Great configuration  and best camera.
1,"Hang issue, Slow processer,choppy  if you will use during charging, Charger is 3rd class"
4,Very good
5,This device is more than enough for a mid range phone category...I will recommend everyone to give it a try if you are a mid range phone user
5,"First of all I would like to tell you that i won't be giving a very technical review like those on ytube videos. I am gonna give a very honest review as a general phone user just like all of you only. This is my first phone for a price above 20k so i thought and researched a lot before buying. I was confused between buying iphone 12 and Nord 2 I know the price difference is more but still I won't go for above 50k to buy any phone other than Iphone. But honestly man i think at 30k this 1+ nord 2 is really astonishing. You don't need to go for one plus 9 or other higher range phones of one plus or else if you have some extra bucks in pocket which u just wanna spend.So I will be telling u the pros and cons of this phone very honestly after 3-4 days of very vigorous usage.Pros:1. Very ultra premium features at this price range of 30k and pretty much matching features with higer range one plus models.2. The display is just great.3. Screen refresh rate you can actually feel to be fast @90Hz.4. No heating issue in phone or the charger till now.5. They are giving a back cover with the phone, which is pretty good actually with bumps in side and camera portion which actually saved my phone from a direct fall on a rough floor that too on screen side..and no scratches at all!!..so the cover's tested guysüòÇand it actually feels elegant. So you need not do the hectic work of searching for back covers after buying a phone and infact the scratch guard which they have put on the screen is quite handy.. I don't think u need to put a temper guard if u handle ur phone well, anyways thats your choice..for me i m gonna go with the scratch guard for some weeks or may be month n lets see how it goes..for now about a week it feels to be performing just outstanding.So i wont be telling u more features of this phone as u can read'em anywhere in its specifications.I will tell you some 'X-Factors of Nord 2. And why you should decide to buy this phone1. The charging time.. I was like whtt!! When the phone shootes up from 0% to 85% in just about 30mins and upto 100% in around 40-45 mins...So the warp charging is just out of world @65W charger. Never ever saw this in any phone.2. The stereo speakers. When i played the first song i was just shocked what i just heard. Yes it actually feels to be giving a 3D feel of sound. Actually sound comes out of speakers on bottom right as well as speakers on top of screen which are meant to be for calling purpose only in other phones .So this phone just rocked here. 3. The camera just performs outstanding in low light, dark or even very dark sorroundings.To check it I went on to my terrace and clicked a picture in dark which you can see yourself..i have put it here. 4. The phone buid really feels premium.Some of the cons or I won't say cons..bcz I don't really feel them as cons.as u can ignore them over the astonishing features of this phone..but since we can't go away without mentioning some cons so here are some.1. They could have provided a little higher battery capacity like those in Samsung phones coz of Such a high resolution display and refresh rate..but it could have increased the weight of phone..so its pretty much understandable.Battery back up is some what 12-14 hrs which I got on continuous usage..like songs.. attending meetings on teams.. Netflix etc. But since it gives so..so..so.. fast charging u just wont feel it.2. No earphone jack..If that is a con to u..not for me actuallyüòÇ Nothing else serious issue this phone has got me into till now .So that it guys..If i find anything else after prolonged Usage I will honestly put it here.So I will say if you wanna buy a phone above 50k just dont..buy this if you budget is ~25k stretch it a lill and buy this Nord 2."
1,In my first review given within 24 hrs l found it amazing but after 10 days of usage l can say it is full of bugs; l checked my return window it passed on 3rd Aug ; l regret to choose one plus over samsung.. sooner l have to exchange or throw this mobile if bugs not fixed.One plus no never purchase; frustrated with this mobile.
4,"Received my unit 4hr ago and here is what I think-1. Feels sturdy and premium in hand.2. 90hz looks absolutely fine, you won't miss 120hz3. In normal usage, the phone did not heat.4. Charged from 20-100% in just 15-20mins. My mind was blow away.5. Cameras- I didn't use it much but a sample image is attached which I took from the primary rear camera. So far it looks good to me.6. UI is clean but there were a lot of permissions which I had to accept to use the basic things like camera, search in the drawer. It clearly says in the policy that it shares my data. I believe we cannot do much about this.This is my initial impression, will update accordingly in the future."
1,"7/28:Received this yesterday and first impression from look and feel was great.Was waiting for some reviews but will go first on this one, havent tried camera yet and should not as I moved from a Pixel 5 to this one. Purely for sake of google not providing dual apps even with eSim option.Things went south1) The mobile heated up a bit even during data transfer done via One plus switch App.2) VLC, gallery kept crashing. Videos will stop in middle and close, gallery will crash while you scroll on pictures.3) Few things are hard to find, not sure why camera need so many permission just to let you open it.4) Then came a update today morning and it hit the app cloner seems. Even with FB, Insta and WA on mobile, its not able to see it. I even reinstalled those to see if it picks it up.Seems like a half baked product with lack of testing rolled out to market. We are the test users.Product is overall okay and not my first one plus device. Just a bit of let down to start with and will have to wait on how soon these issues are sorted.Update 7/31:------------------ App cloner is showing apps now. However below apps continue to crash- Camera- whatsapp- youtuebe- Spotify- shuttle .  Ruined Android auto as well.I am sure list is long, but these are ones tried today and it's pathetic."
1,I got OnePlus Nord 2 5G phone delivered yesterday. While setting up Phone got an update and updated my phone. Some bugs needs to be fixed by OnePlus team. Below are some findings.1. Charging time of this phone from 21% to 100% took  auround 16 minutes which is good but at the same time battery is draining too fast after 2 hours battery was 31%. As I am not heavy user of this phone but still battery drained fast.2. While installing apps or updating apps I get error message stating that my storage is full and need to remove unused apps. I purchased 256 gb internal storage and had 217 gb free storage.3. While I was using flipkart app I noticed that after 12 seconds app closes automatically and I need to reopen again and again after every 12 seconds. This is very annoying.Please think before you buy this phone.
1,Product is good in performanceBut battery draining is fast need to replace
1,I bought one plus phone for the first time and i am very disappointed with it..
1,Bad experience with this from the moment it received.Mobile hangs and slow while the initial startup.Device not working properly and restarts several times automatically.App clone not working and I have the apps in my mobile it mentioned in the app clone but it doesn't showing anything to clone.Normal whatsapp chat drive backup not working... My old whatsapp backups are goneüò°üò°üò°.Very bad and worst experience with OnePlus..
1,There are heating issues with average usage. Battery drains very fast.
1,"Ridiculous experience. My phone comes with dent, didn't expected from amazon and seller."
2,Very bad phone. Over heating for reason. Even i dont play games. üò≠üò≠ I want return it. Battery drain too fast. Only give backup of 2-3 hours. Plz Amazon help. My 30000 get waste. It's not even 24hours. My old realme narzo is better than this
2,Hi All. I have purchased OP Nord 2 for upgrade from my two years old Realme X. But my experience with Nord 2 is very bad. first its display is very bad quality compare to smartphone at 30k range. Even my Realme x display looking good against Nord 2. Its major highlight camera also very poor quality nowhere near to flagship sensor as OP advertising. Daylight pics are pathetic. After system update App Clone function is not working not able to use my 2nd whats app account. Call Recording function is not working which is my main requirement that is working flawless in my realme x. I think OnePlus make fool of us. Everyone who is purchasing will regret afterwards. So beware of OP Nord 2.
1,"Nord 2 software is full of bugs.Clone app is not working after the last update. The ones who had installed lost their data. Fix is expected in the next build, however, one is not sure when that would be available.So, if one is using dual apps, then think twice. I still need to carry my old phone as dual app is not working.Also, OnePlus care(support) has no clue about extended warranty. Paid for extended warranty, 4 days have passed since then but one plus support has no clue.Photo access from gallery is very slow. If one is having hundreds of photos in gallery then pictures take time to load when scrolling through them. Even my previous 2 year old phone fared way better.Software optimization is lacking."
1,The phone overall is great but the OS has lots of bugs. Like its not even 1 day but I had the cloner app installed for Whatsapp which suddenly gets removed after latest update. It shows that no app is installed for which cloner is applicable. I would expect Oneplus to have their software sorted out if they are targeting the premium range users.
5,"I am writing this review after using this Mobile from Last 14days. I know the confusion of a person who is going to spend Big amount of money on mobile. I gone through the same phase and I willl try to give my honest review about OnePlus nord 2 and cover all the aspects of it. I will make sure that after reading this review you will easily make your decision.1) Camerarear camera : 5/5front camera : 4/5Awesome Rear camera with 50MP main perform super. I have attached images for reference. Focus is very fast and dynamic range is also Plus point.front camera is also good buy note best but I can say that over-all it's good in this price range.So many users are complaining about colour os code merge into oxygen os but I feel that camera quality is improved due to this. camera features are well organized compare to only oxygen os.2) software experience : 5/5It's awesome experience for me as I am coming from MIUI ( redmi note 4 ). Clean UI without any bloatware and ads.3) Performance : 5/5All applications are working very smoothly. I never encounter any lagging issues till now.  I didn't play havey games on it so I am not aware about gaming performance. over-all I can say ""Phone makkhan ki tarah chalta hy"".4) charging time : 5/5super fast charging.5) Face recognition Speed : 5/5it's very very fast similar to charging Speed.6) Fingerprint sensor Speed : 4/57) Battery Life : 4/5It's give you 6-7 hours screen on time which is  good. For me Full charging Last for 1.5 days.8) Carrier Aggregation and network quality : 5/59) Look  : 5/5when you hold it on your hands it's look very primium Mobile. I have grey colour which comes with Matt finish.10) Ram management : 3/5This is bit disappointing part in OnePlus nord 2. I think this will improve after software update so no need to worry. 11) Heating issueYes Mobile is heating bit when you use continuesoly for long time. But this is classical OnePlus issue and It can be solve through software update.12) Haptic feedback : 5/513) Display : 5/514) speaker : 5/5dual speakers with High loudness makes is awesome üòéconclusion :If you are normal user and looking for well balance Phone in all aspects then OnePlus nord 2 made for  you in this price range. Just buy it and please don't forget to Thank me later üôÇ"
5,-The refresh rate is just awesome-Camera is fabulous-Gaming is excellent-65 Watt charger charges in 38 minutes-Display is soothing-Color is just wow.. nothing like before.-Wow dealIn short it is the best android launch of 2021
1,I believed in one plus and bought this but camera clarity is below the mark..no light enhancement photos are very dull..not worth it at all
1,Using it since 2 days and facing so much problems. Restarts automatically in Recovery Mode. Too much bugs in Oxygen OS. Not able to clone app inspite having required Apps. Not happy at all. Seems that I have spent my money for a 3rd class category phone.
3,Battery drains fast üòëSuperb charging speed (0to 100) 33 minsü§óDisplay goodBack camera thumps upFront camera quite weeküò¶Brightness okay!!
5,Splendid in style
3,"Delivered yesterday and initial impressions was good . But then when i enrolled my finger print that's when the issue started. The phone wasn't able to read the fingerprint at all . No matter how many times i tried it didn't work . Since the one plus store is very near my place i took the phone over there and they said the had to calibrate the sensor and after that i haven't faced any issue as such .Update after going to the store , still the issue persists technician came and verified the same and the replacements on the way . Hopefully won't face any issues with that one ."
3,The phone's good but I don't know why my apps keep getting closed automatically. I am a little disappointed with this behavior. It happens randomly. I don't expect this kind of nonsense with a 30k device.
1,I was very excited once I received the phone.But i dont know why the phone switched off by itself after 4hrs of usage and never started again. Can be poor quality of the oneplus new series. Now a days oneplus is not working well for its customers
1,I am using one plus 5t currently ..Ordered one plus Nord 2 to upgrade my existing phone. Trust me the display of this Nord 2 looks like a cheap smartphone. Colours of one plus 5t are way nice and better. One plus is losing its credibility and brand value . Looks like a cheap smartphone. Using Nord 2 don't give a premium feel.
1,Video Player is loading.
1,"I had received a dummy product.I am really disappointed to say this, it was first time I came across such an experience, disheartened....Amazon and One plusüò†üò†"
1,"edited:- now I am from 2star to 1star because there is camera issue I facing if you use camera for 5-10 mins its automatically falls and closes Idk why all this issues are coming after 3rd update..üòíplease if you are purchasing the phone then understand there are a lot of phone available in the market which is better and chaper than this.eex. samsung A52,A72Mi 10i, poco f3gt, realme dont go for look"
1,"Phone is heating like hell always at 38¬∞c ,not so worth it according to the hype they created .heats up to 44¬∞c you can not touch the phone. heating is its major problem"
3,"I received this phone yesterday and I'm really disappointed with pathetic camera as it can not capture good pics with close shorts & mostly this phone camera provides over contrast images in daylights and doesn't provide decent image in night mode & battery drains fast. Only thing you can be happy about this phone is battery charges very fast with 100% in just 33 minutes. I feel like cheated with this product purchase and if Amazon is checking on reviews. Please take back this phone & refund the amount or provide a better replacement in the same price range.Update 15/08 - Overall performance is ok now, however in close shots rear camera struggles.Update 27/08 - I still feel it's not worth buying. And for those who want to buy new handset in this price range should wait for Pixel 5a release in India."
1,"Don't buy this product. It has some serious issues with IMEI number. Any OnePlus system may not recognize the IMEI code for the mobile and then your mobile will be ghost for OnePlus. In this case, you will not be eligible for warranty. This has happened with me and now OnePlus team is extremely lethargic and least interested in addressing this issue."
1,"Disappointed since the day 1, all the app says storage not found...the camera switches off all the time, cannot download images on what'sapp even after giving all the permissions..It took me around 10 attempts to attach the picture in this review evertime while attaching the file app crashes...Going for a replacement if it doesn't resolve in one or two day..."
1,Color of product is dark than the  color shown in description. After one day of delivery when I asked to return or replace the item they bluntly refused this.  Worst experience with One Plus . I have given one star because there was no option below this. Totally unhappy and unsatisfied!
5,Performance is really good.Camera and features are better than previous Nord.
1,"Mobile not switching on . showing error like "" the serial is not match fastbook_unlock_verify ok"". Parhetic.....what kind of quality checking is being carried out by ONEPLUS"
1,Bad camera
4,Good
4,ok but not Reach the the Expectation
1,I missed return window time quality of the phone is very poor and within one week of time mobile is working very slow. Never ever seen this kind of mobile I won't recommend this mobile to purchase anyone
4,Camera is bad
3,Mobile phone is software struck
1,"Touch is not working, getting hang since I open it. Product is not good at all. Highly not recommend to anyone."
4,I think charger which you mentioned in discription was different I received a normal charger please make it sure or replace my item
5,Nice product
5,Best phone I like very much.
2,"if u want to waste ur 19k then go for it..low specs, no AMOLED display. Average Camera performance. not recommend for 19k"
2,"Phone is not up to the mark,Display is very dull,Camera performance is ok ok not awesome or an excellentBackside is glossy finish so it's absorbing too much finger printsFor gaming it's goodToo many advertisements...Themes and wallpaper are not free... You will have to buy every item.. (Weird)Charging speed is fastBattery life is goodNot worth in this price range...."
5,* pro phone* sound is decent*  look is great* camera is best part* super dooper fast charger* good battery life* 120 hz work too good lag free* sound quality is decent* rapchik gaming experience
4,"NQA return policy is the biggest challenge IQOO put this in competitive market. Delivery was super fast. Here is the day 2 experience, will share more details after couple of days.One single word if need to say - all rounder.Pros:1. Awesome Performance2. Charger with 55W3. Decent Camera with and without light4. I read many reviews but when experienced FunTouch isn‚Äôt bad overall.Cons:1. Needs to be have AMOLED instead of LED2. In display biometric would have been great3. Water drop notch for front camera gives old look4. Battery drain bit fast seems 120hz is the culprit and don‚Äôt have option to set at lower refresh rate.I don‚Äôt want to judge about 5G bands provided by different handsets now a days, as we don‚Äôt know how and when it get sorted in future."
4,"Hi, bought it on 1st day of sale got it on 11 th no reviews were posted when bought,for this, now why i bought this?Because it doesn't come with miui, to be true,  (do note funtouch os also have some wierd terms and condition from app drawer search to etc places in device, which is something of concern, this makes these chinese brand loose their trust, it better than miui as software experience is ad free but bloat ware still there, like jovi,vivo store, vivo security app etc. Iqoo if you really listening you need to change all these stop giving bloatwares or atleast option to disable it and who ask to agree terms and condition when using phone launcher etc fix these or use stock android launcher) value for money hardware-wise product/s are still offered by Xiaomi, but 'miui' is worse software experince ever, no matter which processor you get, then there are ads...... Poco make this better as ads are not there but then it lacks camera quality,period. And it still got 'miui'(they (Xiaomi) even remove support for devices to early)Update 26/06/2021: i noticed one more con here the device 4g i think only supports 1800mhz for airtel, and due to this call breaks/drops at time indoor and also no carrier aggregation i.e. 4g+ or lte+ indoors. (Not sure issue with airtel or device voice cracking or drop is seen sometimes )Now coming to points why buy this?1. If you can ignore tear drop and ok with lcd display, then belive me display is quite nice with 120 hz refresh rate makes it premium (and even if you buy an amoled display under 20k you will not get AlwayOnDisplay, so it defeats the purpose)2. If POCO f1 speaker was ok for you then this will be also fine sounds nearly same in decibels,(no stereo speaker here)3. Camera specially the primary and selfie are outstanding in this price range and camera app is optimised perfectly, pictures are natural, hdr is actually the Usp here, and selfie are very detailed, wide angle is ok, macro- usable, lowlight primary and selfie do ok but if little lighting is there for subject hdr pulls the job nicely here( hoping future sftware update dnt mess this)4. Fast charge 55 w is pure epic and battery backup(easy 5-6 hr sot)5. OS is well optimsed and peform better than sd 860 with miui in poco, but gpu lacks so gaming is ok but nt as gud as sd860. Note:sd860 is rebranded 855 so its still couple of year old cpu.6. Better package than one+ nord ce(in all specs) and note 10 pro max(camera wise), (if you can ignore few funtouch OS issues)7. If you want call recorder that dnt announce call is getting recorded ü§£ ( India dnt require call recording announcement by law still google dialer do it and all brands put google dialer in most global varient of devices to save money on software development)Why not to buy?1. If you consume lots of content purely, dnt buythis get amoled display (period) plus stero speaker device.(note 10 /pro/max)2. 5G is really a gimmik dnt tempt for only that.3. Camera is not your priority (because it got good camera but since it got lcd screen it might look not upto the mark but trust me it is)/or want as a secondary device.4. Pure gaming (go for x3 pro poco only if budget under 20k)5. Funtouch os is far better than miui but still got bloatware and unnecessary system permisions.(can be removed though and permissions can be denied unlike MIUI)6. Plastic back (doesn't feel that premium in hand) looks gud but.UPDATE: received 1st ota update today(17 jun 2021), they gave may security patch, fixed 3rd party apps lag issue, they fixed sleep battery backup ( have to see since device was already giving quiet good battery standby backup)  and camera focus issue for close subjects now able to focus even on extreme close subjects, hdr looks improved alot in low light, so far things working good. This update shows the camera hardware is very capabale, as software optimisation is actually showing diff on camera results."
1,Worst mobile....don't prefer to purchase those brands like Iqoo.....
5,PERFORMANCE :- 4.5/5RAM CAPACITY :- 4.7/5STORAGE CAPACITY :- 4.0/5LIQUID COOLING LAYER :- 4.9/5BATTERY üîã TIMING :- 4.8/5MOBILE GAMING SPEED :- 4.5/5
1,It is clearly mentioned 7 day return. Still i was asked to explain the issue and the call went on for 30 minutes with amazon. Totally disappointed with amazon. Phone is not upto the mark it has lagging issue hence returning the product.
1,Only hype . not good phone as price... Realme  x7 may be better.
5,I think this phone is the best in its segment.But its not all perfect though.It could have offered more 5g bands and gorilla glass 5 instead of panda glass.Because i never heard of panda glass before.I really don't know which one is stronger.
5,"I have purchased IQOO Z3 on 8 June 2021 in the launch sale and received it today that is 11 June 2021 at the price of Rs 17490. I think it is an apt price to buy for a mid-range buyer. I have initially thought that I would have to shell out Rs 19000 or more for this product. But on receiving the product at the above price range I got extremely delighted.Though I have received the product today and my usage of 4-5 hour won't reflect the product experience fully. But whatever hour phone was with me. It was a wonderful experience. Right from touch, to OS, or camera everything is phenomenal. I would recommend everyone to go for it. At the above price range it better than even Oneplus CE Nord (though it is my opinion, it can vary for others) Screen though is not Amoled but has a refresh rate of 120 Hz and the UI is extremely fantastic.I hope you all will find this product a value proposition for you."
1,"Phone for more or less value for money considering specs,Phone is a little bulky and thickMAJOR concern is, unlike other phone, this phone keeps asking so many(so many!!!) permissions, I feel this is a privacy/security issue as you can't keep reading each and every terms and conditions, it seems theg are trying to exploit people and their privacy by offering high-specs in low cost. I STRONGLY DOUBT THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF GATHERING SO MUCH OF PERSONAL DATA."
4,"Prompt delivery by AmazonAbout productGood points:Nice camera..clear images... satisfiedNight mode...amazingFast...very fast charging...highly satisfiedProcessor.... smooth and powerfulGood light weight design... highly satisfiedVolume...clearBelow points can be considered while taking decision1. Battery. Could have been 50002. Volume loud but not pleasent3. Themes wallpapers needs to buy4. It's user interface could have been better. Samsung M31 is better than this.Minor difference in display..compared to Amoled display. Ok.Overall using bank offers as well as exchange,this is great deal.To sum up, better than other mobiles around 16/17k"
2,"Totally waste.There is no detailed description present in amazon as well as official website.In official website they mentioned it as indisplay fingerprint (But in reality it is side mounted and that is failed concept)This is LCD display no AMOLED(After purchase only i came to know)Camera is not as good ( Because of LCD Display)Night camera mode is just a gimmick.As mentioned it doesn't gives you 50%of charge in19mins. It takes almost 35mins to get 50%, (Tried charging the device from 0) but backup is really good and lasts long for a normal usageFor the price of 23k We dont get Amoled, Indisplay fingerprint, Fast charging (in the name they fooled us), No Good front camera.If it is under 20k We may consider this worth to buy.If you planning to spend 23k spend extra 6k and go for Oneplus"
1,"I used this for 4-5 days and have the following reviewPros- good processorGood camera performanceConsWater droplets notch feels like too much oldNo amoledBuggy software-No direct option to switch sim for shift the data from one sim to anotherLauncher needs unnecessary permissionIf you use third party Launcher accessibility features stop(like you have to give accessibility permission to launcher if you need to enable double tap lock features it stopped working after sometime) , I tried multiple launcher, every launcher have same issue. So you can not use third party launcher and you have to accept forcefully permission of inbuilt launcher.Can't disable permission for Jovi homeToo much bloatwareMany more small bugs ,if I write bugs of software I need much more words to explainIn short worst UIonly 240fps frame rate available for slow motionAt last I will returning this phone in 1-2 days if I did not any proper software update in these 2 days."
3,Just Okay Phone.Camera Quality Is Not Good
3,1. Phone is Good for gamers.2. Not good for photography or videography purpose. I compared Camera with Poco F1. And Poco F1 is winner.3. Camera lens is same used in Redmi Note 10 Pro GW3.4. User interface is good.5. Scrolling & Touching is better.6. Speaker sound quality while listening the song is not good. Its average.7. Battery Performance is ok.8. Screen Brightness is excellent even in sunlight. Impressed with it.You can buy this phone if you are a gamer. But If you want to use its camera then you have to think about it. Stabilization is very bad in video making.
1,It took 39 mins to charge 50% battery.Battery drains fast.Camera ok ok. Not so good.I have doubt about service centre as locations mentioned in phone for servicing are limited and not available in mumbai.Lots of inapp notificationsWould suggest another phone instead of this.
1,"As iQOO is lacking a series I would suggest AdPhone as series name. This phone is full of ads lockscreen, notification tray, ad notifications, there are apps by default having permission to change system setting and these require GAid(Google ad I'd). Screen has warm colours, white basically looks like yellowish cream. Do not buy."
5,"1st time to use IQOO brand, never experienced this much feel by using this phone with other brandsPros:Excellent cameraBattery back upCharging time is very lessDisplayWeight of phonePerformanceSound qualityAll games easy to handleNo heating issueVery premium lookCons:Out put sound ,it is lowNot found any other major cons,Overall good phone... Definitely feel good."
1,Cons : 1.Microphone quality is worst2.Funtouch OS is awful so much junk and bloatware3.LCD display with poor protection4. Poor built quality5. Only 2 5g bands6. 5 layer cooling is a gimmickPros : 1. SD768g2. 55watt Fast charging3. Finger print sensor4. Camera performance is okay5. Battery life6. Gaming modeThats y they are giving additional discountIts worth for around 15k
5,I was earlier using one plus 6(6gb ram version) and now upgraded to IQ OOz3 5G 8gb ram version. I can say that there are more pros than cons in this phone...display is great even it is LCD. I am using super amoled earlier but I find this screen comparable. Phone quality is good. Build quality suberb and battery backup great and very fast 55w charging with practical time from 10 percent to 100 percent in less than hour. Cons is speaker whose volume is not so loud but it is clear and videos can be watched easily
1,"so many pre installed bloatware unable to remove from device.. takes almost 3-4 hrs to cleanup all this mess, that too if you are a computer geek.its never be completely free unless you root the mobile. My next step- done.refer CMD snippet for file names to uninstall using ADB tool.**AMAZON NO LONGER ACCEPTING RETURNS** - NO QUESTIONS ASKED PROMO ENDEDIf you are somebody who cares about your personal data. ""STAY AWAY"".THANKS."
4,Mind blowing camera. Charging speed and battery backup is superb. Ui average.Little tall but it's very handy. Touch response awesome.Just 2 days review. Will update after few days.Few apps are especially Google Chrome not updating. Same reported tried multiple troubleshooting steps. Waiting for their update.Sound is average not even comparable with my 4 years old Asus zenfone 3.
5,"Im one of those who ordered it immediately on the launch.However disappointed with amazon delivary, took 8days to deliver it.Recievedd the mobile with 30% charging which exausted in 3 hrs due to intial process of shifting data. As advertised charged 50%in 19 mins(66 wats flash charger) and later on slowed a bit eventually finishing the charging in 1 hr,Battery heats a little while charging. Screen is butter smooth, bright, refresh rate can be adjusted however i choose smart rate.Finger print reader is absolute fast..Battery easily last for a day or more for a moderate user.Few of the preinstalled apps can be uninstalled.As of now happy with the purchase..only cons found..Fun touch OS and camera.Though not 100% unhappy with camera however im not a ardent user of camera."
1,It‚Äôs not worth seeing it‚Äôs specs in figure and in real life not satisfied at all but I haven‚Äôt returned within 7 days so I am stuck with this laggy device I bought to play BGMI but camera and display and build quality seeing its prize all 3 sucks !! I do still use it for streaming on YouTube ‚ÄòKrusryDemonYT‚Äô but as I said stuck with this device can‚Äôt return please don‚Äôt make the same mistake !
5,It's literally the best phone in the market for this price bracket.Pros-1. Good looking design and very Vibrant display.2. Very fast processor. It's a delight for gamers.3. Amazing battery (Lasts entire day easily even after heavy usage and charges very quickly)4. Camera ia AMAZING. Couldn't imagine such high quality camera from a phone of this price. Very clear and sharp. Even in low light it takes very clear pictures.5. Great RAM management.6. No heating issues.Cons-Couldn't see any as of now.
1,Ok I got phone on Friday.Pros. Super fast charging. 40 to 96% in 30 minGaming is goodCamera is good after the update. Which I got it manually for iqoo site.Screen is decent but have to be carefull as it's not amoled.Few things like after face unlock u need to push screen to open.Writing this review after a brief use of 25 days.Toomany software glitches.Sluggish performance. 120hz refresh rate not seen in performance. Too many network issues.Not a dual 5g phone only one slot is 5g.Even notification bar has glitches. Without any new msg it shows msg icon. Every u try to clear u have to restart phone everytime. Poor signal reception. Call quality is poor comparing to my honor 7x and vivo v17pro. Due to single speaker u can't listen to music on loud speaker. Quality is very poor in it . Needs a large size software update.
5,Amazing mobile......Pocket Friendly.....Latest Processor & Software ....5G Technology.......Good 64 MP Camara.....Side Mounted Fingerprint .....Big Screen..... Perfect Design and most importantly 55 w Charging Speed and Great120 Zh Refresh Rate... Everything is Awesome....Only concern is that battery has to be 5000 mah and Screen should be Amoled.Thanks Amazon for fast delivery.
4,"Let's start with the cons:1. Plastic back so fingerprints are inevitable.2. Display average.3. Single speaker. Sound very low.4. OS has many useless app (some can be deleted).5. The scary part is the 'Useless apps' needs access to your LOCATION, CONTACTS and STORAGE which is a security risk.6. Display is 'Teardrop' which is outdated in today's standards.7. The camera fails to capture the Bokeh effect in portrait mode. The aperture resets itself everytime.Pros:1. The fingerprint issue can be avoided by the durable cover that is provided.2. The Useless apps access can be denied. I did it for mine and everything seems to work fine as of now.3. The phone comes with a 66W Vivo Flashcharge and a 55W USB cable Type-C.4. Charges phone to 50% under 20-25 mins.5. I play COD and the game runs flawlessly thanks to the processor.6. Minimum heating. Never felt it during gaming but while charging the top portion of the phone heats up but that's fine. At least you know the phone will get full charged by 55ish minutes. In the meantime go take a break!7. The price is reasonable.8. If you are looking for a budget gaming phone this can do the job. And IQOO has announced 2 years of System update and 3 years of Security update.9. Apart from the Bokeh issue it is a quite decent camera.Verdict: If you can ignore the fingerprint, display, speaker, the useless apps, the old teardrop screen and the Bokeh issue than this is the phone to go with. If you are mainly looking for the below features for your next phone than you are at the right place.a) Ram: 8GB+ 3GB expandableb) Storage: 256GBc) Charging: 66W brick; 55W Datacable; 4400mah; 55ish mins.d) ProcessorI hope this piece of info be useful while you take the final decision."
1,I took the mobile 15 day's back. It was working fine until today. My sim card is not recognized in the device. I didn't expect such a problem in the brand new device.  I have reached out to customer service & they told that it would take 14 day's  to pick up the  mobile  repair & return back. There is no replacement nor upgrade.  Not at all saticified with the mbl.
1,The phone looks great but features (UI) wise it is just ok ok. Amoled screen is badly missing in this device. Battery drains faster than expected. Used no question asked return policy and returned the device.
4,"Daam ke anusar ye smartphone bohot achha hai, saund ke yalava mujhe kuchvi complaint nehi hai ....Lekin iski performance bohoooot hi achha hai ..Very good product ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,Using after 3 hours feel like-Flash(Torch) is worst- camera avarage-battery draining fast- if we use memory card no place for secondary sim- if we use dual sim no place for memoycardAnd this is the worst phone..... below 10k phone is much better than thisI want to return the product... Amazon please help
1,Camera clarity to bad toally waste
1,Camera or charging is not good
5,"It is a very nice product. Loved it, typical budget smart phone. Every thing is amazingüëçüëç. Best smart phone in this range."
1,Very poor quality mobile..sound system is very low..also When we play the music sound like the spekar was blast..I suggest please don't purchase this product..
3,"Hi, I bought this from Amazon. Based on camera features I bought this but not satisfied with the camera performance. It's perform well only in outdoor shoot with day light. Indoor shoot just an ok level. Battery performance and phone performance really good. Preinstalled app not able to delete except Facebook. Phone slightly getting heat while using camera which is normal. And no gorila glass production. Overall for this price just an average product with loads of features."
5,Overall indian product awsome product
1,No more than 8 app can be open togetherBattery just 6 hr backup Speaker not goodNo dual speaker screen is not good qualityNo secondary micSo many bloatware that you can't uninstall I will not buy any product from Amazon from now
5,"Techno Camon 17 review after using approx. one week.Pros:1. Good budget mobile for normal user for Rs 11750/- after discount in Amazon sale. Got Techno ear buds free with this.2. Performance i.e. 6 GB RAM is good including refresh rate as 90Hz. Perfect combination of 128 GB storage.3. Rear Camera is awsome. Works perfectly in night mode. Love it.4. Battery also lasts for 1.5 days after lots of use like normal game, camera & internet. Also battery saver mode is good.5. Listening to music with techno ear buds with Spotify, just perfect.Cons:1. Battery 5000 Mah looks bit lesser side comparing to other phones in the same budget. Better if it would have 6000 Mah as minimum.2. Front camera lags photo quality as per 16 MP.3. Sometimes showing 70% phone memory is using by phone but doesn't know where all the memory is using?4. In built phone themes and wallpapers are limited.Overall good phone within 11k budget phone comparing to other available models as on date. Also truly ""Made is India"" Phone. Highly recommended to buy."
4,"Let see, guniune review's.Camon 17 , I got some discount from sbi credit card, so for me it's less than actual amount, plus I made a phone exchange so that value amount is 4650 I got, ( realme 3i) overall I got this mobile phone at very low price,For me it's a good deal thumbs üëçup Amazon.Plus they are provide tecno plus along with phone during freedom sale, it's a ü§©ü§©ü§©, wow those who grab the deal.Now m gonna talk about phone tecno 17.Overll it's a good mobile phone, I bought redmi note 10 as well for my father, it's similar to that phone, highlight is below.Display quality is good.Battey is quite good.Charging üîã‚ö° time around 1.30 hrs full charge, but they give 18 watt fast charger, still it's good, .You get 6 gb ram 128 rom.Camera quality is 8/ out of 10. Not bad but it's good for picture and video.Phone is little big.Slim.At last bhai aur behan dost uncle, ye bakwas phone nhi hai, ye ek acha mobile phone h, qki aapko 6/128 is price koi v other company nhi dega,And the processer it quite fun and well responding till now.Over all tecno bhai sahab  good job üëçüíØrock on.Thks Amazon for this deal. I love it.In my family their is 3 mi note 9 pro 1 note 10.And latest addition tehno camon 17 ..Have fun ü§£ .Thank you Amazon. But Amazon pay later ka credit limit 25000 to kr de. So main credit card na used kru.. Just for funnn....I have good credit limit at Amazon pay later. Once again Thank you ‚ù§ amazon"
1,No 1 Worst phone in the worldVery bad camera quality . Can buy this phone for 5000 rupees
3,Phone looking good but don't expect for camera quality. Slow motion video is low quality. Video recording has only 2K quality which is average. Camera quality is not so good. But if you are planning to buy under this range of Indian brand I would recommend go with it just for satisfaction only. Don't expect for something excellent.3 Star I would give.
4,"Camera is neutral, just macro is good. Coming to performance, battery is just one day usage only. Drains out fast in present WFH kind working module. Performance is good. Dislike is the own in-house sone *Hi* application. That bothers, rest is good. This *hi* kind is common with redmi also, they have *get apps* in-house to compete with GPlay"
5,The new Tecno Camon 17 is an amazing smartphone that comes with the following superb features:64 megapixels rear camera that helps to click amazing pictures.Gaming phone at a low price!The fast charging mode is a blessing.It is powered by a Helio G85 gaming processor that ensures smooth functioning.
4,"screengaurd ,pouch and accessorises are not available in out market that is the main drawback and finally screen is very large.camera,battery performance and software awesome......"
5,"After comparing different phones under the price range of INR 15,000, I found Camon 17 one of the superb smartphones. I found that this phone has impressive specifications like elegant design and good screen performance. Moreover, I binge-watch all day long and play games without any battery issues or overheating issues as of now. Without a doubt, I can say that this phone can be called the flagship of the year."
5,"I love this new launch by Tecno! It's the perfect phone for anyone who is on budget but is looking for high quality features. Being a photography enthusiast, camera quality is extremely important to me and honestly, this phone DOES NOT DISAPPOINT"
1,Very bad mobile. Two time i have received damaged product. Mobile sound is bursting and camera image is coming blur in ultra HD. Worst experience of buying this new mobile.
5,"I don't know why people are lying about this mobile it's amazing mobile with very very lowest price....camera amazing, battery backup superb..."
2,"Till now good working.  Hope it works the same as today.On using 15-20 days, the overall review. Camera good. Features good. But sound in phone while in call very bad. Major issue in sound technology and not good for calling. Needs major improvements  ."
5,"I think TECNO CAMON 17 is a good mobile as per the DAY 1 use started.AI Camera looks to be simple and great. Build quality is also good. Photos are clear for me.People who do not know how to use camera has updated the reviews I think here as they have taken picture in macro mode for landscape image and said picture quality it bad.Mind it this phone is great value for money at this price point than other phones if you want a budget smartphone with Good CameraAI Feature tells you all. Also, HI OS comes with cleaner, antivirus and side shortcuts, whatsapp mode, front light while doing video calls to cope up with low light. Voice recorder for whatsapp call.I think TECNO CAMON 17 is value for money budget phone."
5,"The camera of Tecno Camon 17 is one of the best ones in all of the phones that I used. It has a 64 megapixels quad-camera setup and an ultra-clear selfie camera. Surprisingly, the phone has unique features like super night portrait, anti-shake, slow motion and various video modes. It's the best phone that just costs 12999"
4,"Good performance in all features.Only disappointment is no suitable shockproof cover is available in market. Reason, finger print sensor being on side. Sensor is very fast.Magnetic clip covers it in all models of shockproof covers. So touching it is difficult even when cover is open. From my hands mobile may fall as from hands of aged people. Then it may get shattered.Otherwise a good mobile phone worth buying."
5,The camera of Camon 17 is a premium one and the best part is that it comes at an affordable range. Camon series is known for its high-quality camera and Camon 17 takes that to a notch higher. I specially love its Super Night Mode feature. Let's you get creative even in dimly lit environments.
5,"I got Tecno Camon 17 from my parents as I have found my interest in clicking professional pictures. It is undoubtedly the best phone with a professional camera with unique features like super night portrait, aatistic portrait anti-shake, slow motion and various video modes. I can click beautiful pictures and make professional videos with this phone. So don't wait and grab your best deal today from Amazon!"
5,Nice phone at this price range display is very good overall nice value for money smartphone at this price range is this lightest 5000mah battery phone and the designe are very best at back not glossy it is matte and only camon barnding and camera module are glossy overall nice look and camera are decent by defualt the camera on 16mp so better camera image you can change to ultra HD you got 64mp image and Image size is 15 to 19mb so best all-rounder phone in 13k
5,"This smartphone has undoubtedly been the best purchase I have had this year. IPS LCD, 6.6-inches display, Octa-Core, MediaTek Helio G85, 48MP + 2MP camera module with 16MP front camera, and 5000mAH battery unit; what else can you ask for at this price range."
5,"Overall performance is better than other brand like Mi, Redmi 10s , Redmi note. I noted no other  brand is providing 6/128 Ram,Rom and 64 megapixel rear camera in this Budget. 13k it is budget phone .Gaming performance is nice. Camera is better in day ‚òÄlight. Not in night mode. Battery performance is great.afterall I will Go ahead for techno Camon 17 if u need better phone in this price range."
5,"I have recently purchased Tecno Camon 17, and based on my 2 days usage following are the positive points:Elegant design and handy.The battery lasts all day long. I came back home at 7 pm and still have 40% battery left.The camera quality is just outstanding.I am facing slight heat issues under the PUBG highest quality setting. But overall, the phone is amazing."
1,"Wrost mobile,  fully west money,  dont buy this mobile. Camera quality is very bed,  better not working properly."
4,"With the magnificient 5000mAh battery in Camon 17, I don't have to worry about the battery dying during important phone calls and online meets. And and and, there's more! It's flash charging makes it so convenient for me. I don't have to wait around for the phone to charge. It's super-fast!"
5,I don't know what to say it's awesome in this money you can buy this smartphone sure superb performance on the camera quality 16mp selfie has some issues but it will clear on next updation I think very smooth no lag issue not heat issue also there is a hidden flash light on selfie that's awesome surely you can buy this device I think this tecno will be the next upcoming vivo or redmi like company
1,Redmi 9i better than this... worst rear camera. Camera 64 mega pixel but pictures are like feature phone pictures. Even 5 megapixels photos are best when compare with this mobile photos. You find nothing when you zoom in the picture. Simply waste of money and Amazon should look in to this kind of bad products and should stop selling them...I lost the trust on Amazon.
1,"This product is worst that's why they didn't allow return as they are not confident on their product.Camera, sound and video is not goodReplaced the  1st delivered phone and  using  replaced phone"
5,My Instagram game has totally changed after I got the Camon 17. Love the ultra clear selfies that I get every single time!!
5,"Very good for daily uses no issue with performance, best phone with G 85 Processor.If you are looking to a all-rounder phone then go for it.It will not disappoint with performance.Note- Don't expect to much with 64Mp camera because it's average.It's  perform like 32 megapixel."
5,"I gifted Tecno Camon 17 to my brother in silver colour.Pros: The phone sports fast charging, which is just amazing.The RAM and processor ensures smooth usage for enhancing users experience.The look of the smartphone is very sleek and attractive.The camera is terrific.Cons: I haven't found any yet!"
5,The Tecno Camon 17 is an ideal choice for students/aspiring individuals who usually find it hard to find a smartphone that fits the budget. I'm especially in love with the camera quality and exceptional display features! It has gone above expectations for me as per its price range.
5,Values of money really goodüëç I like it this year tecno coman 17 is the best way to start the phone and using all SO very niceüëè camera good display is goodüëç iam buy this phone value 12999 6gb 128 gb same phone value in the mi realme oppo vivo poco price is very high 18999 really iam happy buy this phone
1,"Didn't fulfill expectations, camera, display quality is so bad and return facilities also not available after buying, so don't buy this phone.  quality very bad, display is too bad."
3,No wide angle available in phone despite techno claiming it as camera phone. The quality of pictures are worst. No manual mode available which is available in budget phone these days. Disappointed post buying
5,"First of all I would like to tell you that i won't be giving a very technical review like those on ytube videos. I am gonna give a very honest review as a general phone user just like all of you only. This is my first phone for a price above 20k so i thought and researched a lot before buying. I was confused between buying iphone 12 and Nord 2 I know the price difference is more but still I won't go for above 50k to buy any phone other than Iphone. But honestly man i think at 30k this 1+ nord 2 is really astonishing. You don't need to go for one plus 9 or other higher range phones of one plus or else if you have some extra bucks in pocket which u just wanna spend.So I will be telling u the pros and cons of this phone very honestly after 3-4 days of very vigorous usage.Pros:1. Very ultra premium features at this price range of 30k and pretty much matching features with higer range one plus models.2. The display is just great.3. Screen refresh rate you can actually feel to be fast @90Hz.4. No heating issue in phone or the charger till now.5. They are giving a back cover with the phone, which is pretty good actually with bumps in side and camera portion which actually saved my phone from a direct fall on a rough floor that too on screen side..and no scratches at all!!..so the cover's tested guysüòÇand it actually feels elegant. So you need not do the hectic work of searching for back covers after buying a phone and infact the scratch guard which they have put on the screen is quite handy.. I don't think u need to put a temper guard if u handle ur phone well, anyways thats your choice..for me i m gonna go with the scratch guard for some weeks or may be month n lets see how it goes..for now about a week it feels to be performing just outstanding.So i wont be telling u more features of this phone as u can read'em anywhere in its specifications.I will tell you some 'X-Factors of Nord 2. And why you should decide to buy this phone1. The charging time.. I was like whtt!! When the phone shootes up from 0% to 85% in just about 30mins and upto 100% in around 40-45 mins...So the warp charging is just out of world @65W charger. Never ever saw this in any phone.2. The stereo speakers. When i played the first song i was just shocked what i just heard. Yes it actually feels to be giving a 3D feel of sound. Actually sound comes out of speakers on bottom right as well as speakers on top of screen which are meant to be for calling purpose only in other phones .So this phone just rocked here. 3. The camera just performs outstanding in low light, dark or even very dark sorroundings.To check it I went on to my terrace and clicked a picture in dark which you can see yourself..i have put it here. 4. The phone buid really feels premium.Some of the cons or I won't say cons..bcz I don't really feel them as cons.as u can ignore them over the astonishing features of this phone..but since we can't go away without mentioning some cons so here are some.1. They could have provided a little higher battery capacity like those in Samsung phones coz of Such a high resolution display and refresh rate..but it could have increased the weight of phone..so its pretty much understandable.Battery back up is some what 12-14 hrs which I got on continuous usage..like songs.. attending meetings on teams.. Netflix etc. But since it gives so..so..so.. fast charging u just wont feel it.2. No earphone jack..If that is a con to u..not for me actuallyüòÇ Nothing else serious issue this phone has got me into till now .So that it guys..If i find anything else after prolonged Usage I will honestly put it here.So I will say if you wanna buy a phone above 50k just dont..buy this if you budget is ~25k stretch it a lill and buy this Nord 2."
1,In my first review given within 24 hrs l found it amazing but after 10 days of usage l can say it is full of bugs; l checked my return window it passed on 3rd Aug ; l regret to choose one plus over samsung.. sooner l have to exchange or throw this mobile if bugs not fixed.One plus no never purchase; frustrated with this mobile.
4,"Received my unit 4hr ago and here is what I think-1. Feels sturdy and premium in hand.2. 90hz looks absolutely fine, you won't miss 120hz3. In normal usage, the phone did not heat.4. Charged from 20-100% in just 15-20mins. My mind was blow away.5. Cameras- I didn't use it much but a sample image is attached which I took from the primary rear camera. So far it looks good to me.6. UI is clean but there were a lot of permissions which I had to accept to use the basic things like camera, search in the drawer. It clearly says in the policy that it shares my data. I believe we cannot do much about this.This is my initial impression, will update accordingly in the future."
1,"7/28:Received this yesterday and first impression from look and feel was great.Was waiting for some reviews but will go first on this one, havent tried camera yet and should not as I moved from a Pixel 5 to this one. Purely for sake of google not providing dual apps even with eSim option.Things went south1) The mobile heated up a bit even during data transfer done via One plus switch App.2) VLC, gallery kept crashing. Videos will stop in middle and close, gallery will crash while you scroll on pictures.3) Few things are hard to find, not sure why camera need so many permission just to let you open it.4) Then came a update today morning and it hit the app cloner seems. Even with FB, Insta and WA on mobile, its not able to see it. I even reinstalled those to see if it picks it up.Seems like a half baked product with lack of testing rolled out to market. We are the test users.Product is overall okay and not my first one plus device. Just a bit of let down to start with and will have to wait on how soon these issues are sorted.Update 7/31:------------------ App cloner is showing apps now. However below apps continue to crash- Camera- whatsapp- youtuebe- Spotify- shuttle .  Ruined Android auto as well.I am sure list is long, but these are ones tried today and it's pathetic."
1,I got OnePlus Nord 2 5G phone delivered yesterday. While setting up Phone got an update and updated my phone. Some bugs needs to be fixed by OnePlus team. Below are some findings.1. Charging time of this phone from 21% to 100% took  auround 16 minutes which is good but at the same time battery is draining too fast after 2 hours battery was 31%. As I am not heavy user of this phone but still battery drained fast.2. While installing apps or updating apps I get error message stating that my storage is full and need to remove unused apps. I purchased 256 gb internal storage and had 217 gb free storage.3. While I was using flipkart app I noticed that after 12 seconds app closes automatically and I need to reopen again and again after every 12 seconds. This is very annoying.Please think before you buy this phone.
1,Product is good in performanceBut battery draining is fast need to replace
1,I bought one plus phone for the first time and i am very disappointed with it..
1,Bad experience with this from the moment it received.Mobile hangs and slow while the initial startup.Device not working properly and restarts several times automatically.App clone not working and I have the apps in my mobile it mentioned in the app clone but it doesn't showing anything to clone.Normal whatsapp chat drive backup not working... My old whatsapp backups are goneüò°üò°üò°.Very bad and worst experience with OnePlus..
1,There are heating issues with average usage. Battery drains very fast.
1,"Ridiculous experience. My phone comes with dent, didn't expected from amazon and seller."
2,Very bad phone. Over heating for reason. Even i dont play games. üò≠üò≠ I want return it. Battery drain too fast. Only give backup of 2-3 hours. Plz Amazon help. My 30000 get waste. It's not even 24hours. My old realme narzo is better than this
2,Hi All. I have purchased OP Nord 2 for upgrade from my two years old Realme X. But my experience with Nord 2 is very bad. first its display is very bad quality compare to smartphone at 30k range. Even my Realme x display looking good against Nord 2. Its major highlight camera also very poor quality nowhere near to flagship sensor as OP advertising. Daylight pics are pathetic. After system update App Clone function is not working not able to use my 2nd whats app account. Call Recording function is not working which is my main requirement that is working flawless in my realme x. I think OnePlus make fool of us. Everyone who is purchasing will regret afterwards. So beware of OP Nord 2.
1,"Nord 2 software is full of bugs.Clone app is not working after the last update. The ones who had installed lost their data. Fix is expected in the next build, however, one is not sure when that would be available.So, if one is using dual apps, then think twice. I still need to carry my old phone as dual app is not working.Also, OnePlus care(support) has no clue about extended warranty. Paid for extended warranty, 4 days have passed since then but one plus support has no clue.Photo access from gallery is very slow. If one is having hundreds of photos in gallery then pictures take time to load when scrolling through them. Even my previous 2 year old phone fared way better.Software optimization is lacking."
1,The phone overall is great but the OS has lots of bugs. Like its not even 1 day but I had the cloner app installed for Whatsapp which suddenly gets removed after latest update. It shows that no app is installed for which cloner is applicable. I would expect Oneplus to have their software sorted out if they are targeting the premium range users.
5,"I am writing this review after using this Mobile from Last 14days. I know the confusion of a person who is going to spend Big amount of money on mobile. I gone through the same phase and I willl try to give my honest review about OnePlus nord 2 and cover all the aspects of it. I will make sure that after reading this review you will easily make your decision.1) Camerarear camera : 5/5front camera : 4/5Awesome Rear camera with 50MP main perform super. I have attached images for reference. Focus is very fast and dynamic range is also Plus point.front camera is also good buy note best but I can say that over-all it's good in this price range.So many users are complaining about colour os code merge into oxygen os but I feel that camera quality is improved due to this. camera features are well organized compare to only oxygen os.2) software experience : 5/5It's awesome experience for me as I am coming from MIUI ( redmi note 4 ). Clean UI without any bloatware and ads.3) Performance : 5/5All applications are working very smoothly. I never encounter any lagging issues till now.  I didn't play havey games on it so I am not aware about gaming performance. over-all I can say ""Phone makkhan ki tarah chalta hy"".4) charging time : 5/5super fast charging.5) Face recognition Speed : 5/5it's very very fast similar to charging Speed.6) Fingerprint sensor Speed : 4/57) Battery Life : 4/5It's give you 6-7 hours screen on time which is  good. For me Full charging Last for 1.5 days.8) Carrier Aggregation and network quality : 5/59) Look  : 5/5when you hold it on your hands it's look very primium Mobile. I have grey colour which comes with Matt finish.10) Ram management : 3/5This is bit disappointing part in OnePlus nord 2. I think this will improve after software update so no need to worry. 11) Heating issueYes Mobile is heating bit when you use continuesoly for long time. But this is classical OnePlus issue and It can be solve through software update.12) Haptic feedback : 5/513) Display : 5/514) speaker : 5/5dual speakers with High loudness makes is awesome üòéconclusion :If you are normal user and looking for well balance Phone in all aspects then OnePlus nord 2 made for  you in this price range. Just buy it and please don't forget to Thank me later üôÇ"
5,-The refresh rate is just awesome-Camera is fabulous-Gaming is excellent-65 Watt charger charges in 38 minutes-Display is soothing-Color is just wow.. nothing like before.-Wow dealIn short it is the best android launch of 2021
1,I believed in one plus and bought this but camera clarity is below the mark..no light enhancement photos are very dull..not worth it at all
1,Using it since 2 days and facing so much problems. Restarts automatically in Recovery Mode. Too much bugs in Oxygen OS. Not able to clone app inspite having required Apps. Not happy at all. Seems that I have spent my money for a 3rd class category phone.
3,Battery drains fast üòëSuperb charging speed (0to 100) 33 minsü§óDisplay goodBack camera thumps upFront camera quite weeküò¶Brightness okay!!
5,Splendid in style
3,"Delivered yesterday and initial impressions was good . But then when i enrolled my finger print that's when the issue started. The phone wasn't able to read the fingerprint at all . No matter how many times i tried it didn't work . Since the one plus store is very near my place i took the phone over there and they said the had to calibrate the sensor and after that i haven't faced any issue as such .Update after going to the store , still the issue persists technician came and verified the same and the replacements on the way . Hopefully won't face any issues with that one ."
3,The phone's good but I don't know why my apps keep getting closed automatically. I am a little disappointed with this behavior. It happens randomly. I don't expect this kind of nonsense with a 30k device.
1,I was very excited once I received the phone.But i dont know why the phone switched off by itself after 4hrs of usage and never started again. Can be poor quality of the oneplus new series. Now a days oneplus is not working well for its customers
1,I am using one plus 5t currently ..Ordered one plus Nord 2 to upgrade my existing phone. Trust me the display of this Nord 2 looks like a cheap smartphone. Colours of one plus 5t are way nice and better. One plus is losing its credibility and brand value . Looks like a cheap smartphone. Using Nord 2 don't give a premium feel.
5,value for money but battery not good
1,"Battery back up is bad , hardly one  hour only .I want to urge all the buyers please comment frank and true so , one may avoid these bad things."
5,This is a brilliant Mini phone but market price 700 rupees Amazon price 1300
5,All things are Excellent Nothing is Damage and Forget to pack.
5,Very convenient.  It can be used as an emergency phone. Charge will last for 2days.
1,"This is a useless and worst phone. Wastage of money . Purchased this and the phone was not reading the Sim card. Replaced the item,but when received the replacement,again this useless stuff was not able to read the Sim. Not working at all. WORST,DONT BUY THIS."
1,"This product is tiny and good for carry, but battery backup is horrible, even its not running 3 hours in standby.don't buy if you want battery life more then 3 hours"
1,I have order it no of times but sim didnt work in any of the device.Do not buy
1,This mobile is very smallest to small  and price is high  it's not better than other mobile phone
5,Amazing product it is works good
4,Super on
4,"Really amazing product but the manual to use it is not clear so have to do some experiments to discover some features, also it is a little difficult to make Bluetooth calls otherwise product is good.(Edit:-Mic could be improved)"
3,Sound quality good handling good
5,"Battery life is quite good, sound quality in call is amazing but in Bluetooth audio there no bass only treble..... , Its mic quality i think can be much better... If u speak in low tone then it will not catch your voice ,you have to say little bit louder or take mic to ur mouth to speak... , I think the price is bit high.... It has magic voice that can change your voice during call which is pretty amazing ... You can use this to prank your friends"
2,Don't buy it
1,"I needed this phone badly, delivery was great, but phone is damaged, so iam very furious about that, Amazon should check items properly before delivering."
1,I received a damaged product.just because we couldn't put a sim to check the product(within the said replaced day policy) we have to keep this damaged product..it cannot read the sim
5,Product is very useful battery backup for 1 day in heavy use and 2 day for minium use but lookwise it's best and very very handyYou can put it in your jeans pant upper mini pocket very easily.I Love It
5,"Works as claimed, both as a phone in its own right as well as a Bluetooth earphone. The FM also works but the stations are not saved. The audio option needs some mp3 files but there's no space to load then."
3,Battery quality is too bad. Battery life only 1 hour.....Sound quality good.Value for money.
3,not  up to the mark when comparatively to other china products small phones
5,Good quality
3,I buyed 875 rupees for this product at amazon.But the max retail price is printed on back cover of mobile is jist 300/-rupees.But black coating is pasted on that 300 price which v cannot see it..Then it looks like some fraud item is given to me..my trust on amazon was very downfall now...
4,I love this product one of the best mobile battery life also good in this range buy it no problem.
5,Small hai pr cute hai
1,Sim card not working

3,all thing is good but camera quality is not so good as compared to other phone on this price range
1,"During the photo session , delay noticed when we are changing the phone  from portrait to landscape.  Phone has been freezed  couple of time while taking the photos ,Phone  is up -to- date with SW/OS/Security updates"
5,Battery life is extraordinary.Cameras are okay.Performance is good.Nokia phones never disappoint
3,"Basic necessity like vibration alert is missing, highly inconvenience. Rated 3 star for this"
4,Camera quality not good. Nokia 6.1 plus has better camera than this one. I stil can't believe that this is Nokia mobile's camera.
1,"I purchased it on August 1st 2021. After using 3 month , this mobile is lacking.While I don't even play any game in this mobile.and use some common app like youtube , whatsapp, Google , Facebook and some apps for study"
5,I Red about Itel being most trusted Brand below 7000 and made my mind after seeing the product and specs. Especially Price with these specifications is quite impressive. I m also user of Itel Feature phone and upgrading with Itel phone SP now. The screen size is very good with Triple camera is what I liked about the phone. ...... My recommendation is this phone is Value for money.
5,1) On time delivery from Amazon2) best product below 6K3) Great camera and big battery 4000 mh almost 1.5 day it‚Äôs battery backup.
5,"Clearly the best phone in the price range. I am impressed by the screen, speaker and camera quality"
5,"Received yesterday! very good üëçhandset at this price, features brilliant including System User Interface like Samsung and Asus 10g above , storage and fast processing cores like snapdragon 700 above, even though its 2 gb ram its still pick up fast for files reader, send and received, download and upload speed with no heating issues or 1 hours continues heavy files transferred at the same time when internet connection is active.All connectivity speed time perfect for such low price Moreso it's Indian made so i am sure every parts and services will be available right at my own city for repairing or services! Only disadvantage part is there is no recycle bin like Itel vision1, but there's is always an option for Android.Battery is perfect for medium internet user, RAM usage should equivalent to storage capacity meaning storage free space should not falls below 5gb for heavy RAM usage like PUBG, Free fire, Fire Arena, Mobile legend.Camera pixel density, HDR, etc is better than others companies 10g above no lag or lack or whatsoever while video recording and capture time delay is very less means no shaking no blurring and light AI management is perfect for low light room, but should never compared with 74 mega pixel which is 16g above because this is 6g affordable handset and AI support is fun and easy to control that's why they call mobile unlike DSLR camera for manual shot.Go for Itel at this price range you can get the trend and fashion from others companies but never the complete details of hardware like this Itel vision2!"
2,"The smartphone‚Äôs only attraction is punch hole camera with 6.6 inch display but rest everything is poorly disappointing from android OS to camera quality, making it below average and low performance device with no good impression, where the specifications does not even match actual features. I cannot continue keeping it, therefore returning back for full refund."
3,"Ram,camera is ok.takes 6 hrs for full charge 0 to 100%."
4,"Good one for a budget phone. Camera, battery and processor does the job!üëçüèª"

3,"The most irritating things are RAM management, photo after clicking does not saves instantly you have to wait, sometimes camera freezes during video call. Go for 2000 rupees extra and buy oppo or redmi, they are much better."
1,This is another Chinese brand on the market trying to open up a market for itself. The specs look good but the performance is not up to mark.
5,G o o d  p h o n e  g o o d  c o l o u r .
5,Great features for this pricing. Nice large display and good camera performance. Also comes with Fingerprint sensor and face unlock at this price point.
5,Good product with nice camera and design. In-display camera looks really beautiful. I recommend this product for everyone looking a value for money device in less than 8K.
5,Great photo Ossam phone
5,"Been using it for a few days and specs really hold up. I had just bought this as it was good value for money phone I could find with 4GB+64GB. But after using it, I realized the other features like the display, battery backup and camera are all great. Screen is highlight!"
5,"Happy to write 1st 100% Satisfied product review regarding Tecno Spark 7 Pro (Magnet Black 6GB RAM 64GB Storage smart phone). Liked Unique features like Kids Mode, Special functions, FREE from Harrassment filter for Spam calls and SMS, chip-assisted protection, Display Eye care setting, Truely worth of price satisfied with its features. Competes well with other top branded phones."
1,"I purchased Technospark phone from Amazon. in. Almost 10 days after, the touch screen of the phone stopped working. Since the product is defective/faulty kindly initiate refund. The refund policy of Amazon is showing 7 days refund. In order to maintain continued relations with Amazon,kindly provide early solution."
5,"I bought the phone after a lot of research,as i wanted a value for money all rounder and boy there are so many options...This one has it allLOOKS -9/10 -Looks stylish,suave,upmarket and yet simple.CAMERA- 9.5/10 - Fantastic camera at this price , both pictures and videos are amazing with great ai featuresBattery,Display - 9/10Go for it if you want a vfm all rounderCONS-1.Not really a con but it has single front flash whereas the specs mentions dual front flash,so though usage wise it's not at all an issue but you expect better communication.OVERALL-9.5/10 -- GO FOR IT!!!"
1,"Not dual front flash,Only single flash"
5,"Only few days back, Purchased Techno Spark 7Pro( KF8 Model, Android 11 ) with a Silicone back cover , charger , NO earphone at Rs 10450/-, in effect. It's a fantastic model at this price, having many awesome AI like management and control features, very powerful battery, awesome camera features, Front Dual flash, very good MONO sound quality and so on.Only CONS, as I found was that although there's an option for activating CALL RECORDER in this KF8 model but I couldn't locate how to listen/play to the recorded content...this confusion needs clarification."
3,"Its a good value for money phone, resolution is not good however, if you have been using some decent phone with good display then you will feel it right away, other than that its a good phone with solid performance, I just felt that its brightness is bit less on full level its not as well lit as my other phone on half level. I am really impressed with its performance however it runs all games and heavy apps with ease. I bought it as my secondary phone and i am quite happy with it."
1,Please if you found delivery by appario private limited... Please don't buy... I got 2nd hand mobile and returned. Mobile is okay okay... But I will recommend to you go with redmi not 9... Looks great... This techno looks like dagar.....youtube videos not looks good.
4,Nice mobile to use that. Back camara excellent. Front cam not bad. Need to improve some settings. In Mobile hotspot settings not able to manage connections.Have a good battery. But slow charging.
5,The phone works well without any performance issues like time lags or apps hanging midway. The screen resolution is excellent and gives a crisp viewing experience with bright colours and good clarity. The camera has an excellent resolution and is able to take equally vivid photographs during day and night-time. I would absolutely recommend this phone to anyone who‚Äôs looking for a seamless experience at value-for- money prices.
4,"Amazing finishing, great speed worth for money."
5,"I urgently needed a phone and I bought this phone after being recommended by a friend. It seems to have everything in it. Amazing AI camera, long battery, great display etc. Moreover, it's Andriod 11. What more can I ask for? Check the pictures I posted. The camera captures great light and has sharpness. I am a happy Tecno customer."
5,"I love the specs. I had just bought this as it was cheapest phone I could find with 4GB+64GB. But after I recieved it, I realized the other features like the display, battery back and camera are all amazing. This phone is clearly the best phone for 10k."
5,"After a month use:Happy With:-Battery Life: one time charge for more than 1 Day- camera quality: 100% satisfied with the photos with good detail- Screen good for watching movies netflix, watched all episodes of Family Man 2 on this phone. Brightness and good color- so many colorful theme options"
3,"The phone is good but there is some thing it is missing like e compass is not there, while other company is providing everything in this range, techno should also do all I feel bad if you are giving ‚Çπ 10000 from your techno like this. I didn't expect this from techno company, just remember that if you are taking 10000 then phone should be full loaded,Me and many of my friends and my family members all use techno mobiles, but if this action happens, you will neither buy us nor anyone for advertising, I am very angry with techno company, remember if competing with other companies If the mobile phone is to be loaded in the range of 10000, there should be no such action, if the mobile is able to be returned, then I definitely do it, I do not use it, I am sad at night about this mobile,"
5,Just ok it‚Äôs budget phone don‚Äôt accept much from this phone.Battery üîã- first day full charged 2 days after a month used now fully charged 1 day only . üïìValue for money üíµ - it‚Äôs not true! Many options available in market and online platforms.Looks and design- not impressedBut if like this brand then you can stay with this otherwise ü§ôGo for other brand under 10k
5,"I was the first person to buy a Tecno in my family. And once, others saw the performance, this is the third Tecno phone. And as usual, Spark 7 pro also hit the bull's eye in terms of value for money. The camera works amazingly video calls and even for clicking pictures in the night. Best buy ever!"
4,"Little heating issue while charging. !Camera quality was good, fingerprint reader working fast. Product was good for in 10k,Selfie Cam flashlight Super working."
2,"DON'T BUY THIS PHONE  -  I dislike the product because camera is not  good,the quality of camera is lower than chinese phones and is not really 48MP . Low brightness problem , brightness is very low you will have to use it in full brightness which will drain the battery quickly. Battery is also not long lasting. Charger given with the phone looks like it's not meant for this phone you have to turn the cable up-side-down for charging and also the charger won't fit correctly but however it charges the phone and also it takes a long time to charge . And you will not get any type of earphone with it. And the most disappointing thing is that the phone downloads apps on its own and also you can't stop the download ."
1,"I purchased this product in July. It is stop working in september when i took it to the service center to get it repaired, they said that its mother board has to be changed then after 10 days we are unable to repair it and providing me DOA letter and told me to contact from where you have purchased Will get a new mobile instead and when I talked to Amazon customer care, they said that we have noted your complaint, you will get the solution by 14.09.2021 and when today I again talked to Amazon customer care, they say that there is no complaint Yours has not happened.Please help"

2,1) very slow operating.2) camera not good.3) selfie camera not happy.4) Alexa app not inbuilt.Overall it's a face mobile by amazon.I am feeling so bad for I have activated amazon Prime for this mobile.
1,Very bad product. Camera quality is worst. Also display quality is wrost.I want to return Or replace but customer service not allowed to do the same. I recommend do not buy this product. It's not worth to invest 13k
4,"It's a good , overall it's good for normal users,use of 5g technology downgraded the camera (cost cutting) ,may the punch hole in front could be smaller ,but the look of the phone is very great it's feels excellent in hand,those who need 5g for budget can rely on this"
1,Worst üëéüëéüëé
3,"At first looks, its seems high end phone.Surprisingly no touch sensorWorst part that you can use either sim card or sd card in 2nd sim slot, it is no where mentioned in technical specs...Will use and share further information later"
2,Camera is not upto mark. If you will compare with other redmi phones below 10k ranges.
1,Phone is not so good as expected just say one word thik thak
5,"This product is good, it's ultra slim, though it's having 8mp front camera, photo quality is nice...But for other viewers of this reviews, I'm only telling that if you setup fingerprint, doo set it up on pressing, else you'll end up like me factory resetting the device in it showing maximum fingerprint attempts reached, the phone is locked..."
1,It's a worst phone
3,2 Megapixel Wala Mobile Bhi Acha Clarity Deta hai
2,"I can't imagine this worst ever product, poorest camera quality, front even worst. Lot of grains coming in images. Don't know why they are saying fast charging, it's ordinary charge, taking 2 hours to charge. Sound quality is poor, my four year vivo phone is still louder than this. Pathetic device ever"
1,"Very disappointed with Redmi.The phone with such third class features doesn't even deserve to be priced 15999/- ..... Total waste of money.... And there's not even return policy.. ..Camera quality sucks, not smooth enough...such a disappointment it is..."
1,"Please do not buy this phone because of price,5g and alexa.The phone has lot of complaints like heating while charging and for using continuously 30mns, hanging problem and slow processor not good camera no fast charging it takes more than 2 hrs for full charge.Finger print not up to mark finally there is no return option  only replacement and  support for replacement is worst."
1,"Waste of money, too many ads and background services. Please don't purchase MIUI PHONES and that too on AMAZON."
2,I will not recommend this phone. Nothing is good here except 5G which cannot be verified now. Battery is poor. Display is average and both camera are very poor. Alexa is not inbuilt. I have decided not to buy xiaomi phone any more. Repending very much for buying two phones. I should have bought Samsung instead.
2,"Received phone on 29th July‚Ä¶ Initially everything was good but after normal usage of almost 2 hours phone hanged and got very hot and camera quality is very pathetic, and while many apps were not respond properly like Paytm and Amazon. Returned the product on next day itself‚Ä¶ Not worth of it."
2,Display quality bad camera quality also bad Mobile heating not worth this price
3,"Dislike: Fake Promotion for Alexa Inbuilt, Fake Promotion for 2 Sim Card Slots. Camera is average quality. Battery draining fast for a new phone of MI category. Just because of few sales... MI is tarnishing it's brand name. Compensate us with updated software immediately or replace the phone. What is this... U can't play with customer trust just like ths, even paid for the phone at one go.. is ths how MI treats customer these days?  I can assure ths to MI ths is my first & last MI phone and I will proactively recommend other users to snub MI unless massive software upgrade is there."
1,"Dear all,Appearance on front side of the product not upto mark.previously i have poco m2 pro tat is far better than this in performance and in specificationsPlease dont go for this product, only thing is 5g and tempting in flash sales. This product is not upto mark.Totally dissatisfied after using the product for 2 days.H Naidu"
2,Phone looks good but audio is not clear
5,"So one week has finally over, now I guess I am ready for the review. Even after seeing so many negative reviews, I still bought it, and I don't regret, I don't understand why many people hated it, I guess it is just some petty ""Boycott Chinese Stuff"", cause I really don't face any issues. But then again don't expect too much because you are not paying excessive amount. I decided to write both PROS and CONS together.Great battery life. Even if you play games like me, I play Genshin Impact, graphics and storage is higher than Free Fire and PubG, yet it doesn't consume too much charge, I can easily play up to 5 hours with 20%-30% charge decreases.Fresh rate is also very noticing, my mobile don't freeze even if I play for 6 hours then browse in social sites. I tried to use it as much as I can for 3 days still no damage in battery life or game experiences.I really like the back camera, though I won't suggest it if you are looking for a phone because of photography, still the back camera is very nice. Selfie camera is average, or maybe a bit lower, still okay for me. I won't show any photo cause privacy issues.MIUI was 12 when it reached my home but in between 2 hours it asked for update so this phone indeed has MIUI 12.5 stable version. Which makes the phone unique internally.A lot of daily used apps are pre-installed but you can uninstall and reinstall as your preference, I don't need Facebook, so I deleted it and it actually got deleted from the phone, normally this types of apps don't delete either they just shut down or stay right there, so this is why I like this phone.Although the phone hasn't AMOLED display but trust me in you want, there is no difference for it, the display is still vibrant and beautiful, but a bit blueish, you can notice it only in Dark Mode if you got a excellent pair of eyes.Since it is 5G set, so generally it has more antennas, hence a strong connection even in a deserted place. And for this mobile I do agree that 4G sim card work better in 5G phones.Lastly, a lot people complaint that it doesn't have dual sim, actually it do, but if you put dual Sim, you can't install SD card, cause 1st sim slot is normal slot but second one is hybrid, you can either fit sim or fit card. Though I believe 128GB is too much of storage if you don't store any video with long duration.(1 hour- 10 hours)So at the end, it is my best phone. I really like it."
1,"Worst of Battery backup, drained within 5-6 hours after full charged. Front camera resolution is very bad. Back panel body heat up too much after 60-70% battery charged.If you complaint about problem in customer care so they booked a technical person for home visit but technician didn‚Äôt visit to home and try to solve your problem on telephonically and marked mobile condition Okay without check mobile physically."
1,"Battery does not sustain even for a day, 5000 MAH battery is just for the sake of name.Camera clarity is also not upto mark, Alexa also does not work properly.Not worth buying..."
1,"Front camera is terrible, like VGA camera. The phone doesn't feel smooth even on normal usage. Better go for some other mobile without 5g in this price range. No one would have expected such a third rated mobile for 16k. Totally not worth the money. The best part is, I couldn't request for a return."
5,Dual sim but expandable memory with one sim only. No extra slot for memory card. Otherwise mobile is good.
1,"Phone started hanging on first day itself. Camera is not at all good. No picture clarity even in rear camera. Battery backup is bad.I personally did not like Redmi UI. It has lot of flaws and yet to cover long way to compete with Samsung or Stock Android user experience.I won't recommend to throw away 15K for this Chinese phone. Go for Samsung blindly for mid range phones. Or if you can extend your budget upto 30k, go for Google Pixel phones. They are amazing on every front. You get iPhone kind of premium experience with Pixel."
1,"Worst camera at this high cost, common slot for 2nd sim and memory card, Wifi network and mobile network is weak compared to how it worked for previous phone, etc etc...Even my Moto G2 of year 2014 have better front and rear camera quality then this phone.Prefer to add Rs 5k more and buy oneplus basic model."
1,Wrost product both cameras are not good it's not worth to pay 15k I think mi 9 is better then note 10TAm trying to replace
2,"I think these people have made the rest of the thing too weak just to give 5G phones.Plus point:1) Low budget 5G phone2) Battery life is sufficient3) Smooth Handling PhoneNagative Point:1) Camera image quality is worst (both front and rear).2) Display quality is bad and doesn't actually give real color. (Even if you set a refresh rate of 90 MHz)3) After 1 minute video recording, the phone is getting very heat.4) Lots of Un-useful apps where you can't uninstall.5) The phone camera function is too simple and does not offer many options. AI is not working actually.6) They offer a approximately 20W fast charger but the phone does not charge quickly.7) Hybrid SIM slot, you cannot use both SIMs with memory card."
1,"Not very much satisfied with camera quality, speed is also low and sometimes screen sticks also. Only plus point is it's 5G which is not very relevant as of now."
1,Camera is worst. I don't understand how do they measure it as 48megapixel. This is one of the worst mobile for camera. Don't buy it if you are looking for camera. Rest is good. Need some third party review before buying such phones on launch.
5,Love ‚ù§it
5,very comfortable in my hands...I am happy these products...Thanks  Redmi üåπüåπ
5,"Pros:5G90Hz display48MP camera, Macro 2xC type chargerIR blaster, 3.5mm jack, AlexaLimitations because of price band-18w chargerno AMOLED display but 90hz is really smoothA great starter phone at this price."
3,The camera picture quality is very low.... It's not look like 48 megapixel.....I specially order this phone for pics but not worth it...Its a average phone doesn't meet my expectations... Better go for Oppo 5g phone for better picture quality....not recommended redmi 10t 5g for purchase.
4,Before buying this product I was thinking whether I have to buy this phone or not after so many negative reviews but finally I purchased and now I'm satisfied with redmi note 10T...Camera quality is not good nor bad...Battery life is also satisfactory...It have Dual app option on app->manage app option and is working fine.Alexa is also working fine now but not worked first time... Done some investigation to make alexa work...Sound quality is also nice...Purchased on independence day sale 10 Aug 2021.Till now it's working fine.Will share more after using it...
1,Received buplicate charger
2,The phone is good. But not satisfied with its software. It does not have facility of all call recording. Also it notifies missed call frequently even if you have noticed it. As it's my practice to give my review onlyafter several use. The more problem with software i will show whenever I see it.
1,"The worst front camera ever given by redmi. I have been a costumer since the production of redmi note 3 and this ia by far the worst camera experience ever. Also, it took me a lot while to realise that the vibration motor is not the same as redmi note 9 pro. They should mention such details in the description atleast, bit there was not detail of haptic driver in this device"
4,The phone is very much nice. Everything I found is Good in this category. The only thing which is disrupting the quality is MIUI.
5,This product is too good. I like it nd my mom also like her gift of this phone. it's camera is wonder full.nd selfie falsh of front camera is too good .I agree this
3,It's get very hot even after a short time of usage. Camera is good. Battery backup is long. Charger also get very hot when it's charging the phone. Other than that everything works properly. Offers good features at this price.
1,Very bad product I am already returned and replace but very bad Amazon cheered me
1,"Worst product please don't buy... Battery does not last for even 7 to 8 hrs. And... Worst thing is... I am not able to see the pictures and songs on my SD card. If I restart the phone, I can view the files for 10 to 15 mins and then again it shows nothing. I replaced the product and again same issues... So I returned it. Total waste of time and money"
5,"The phone is loaded with 32 gb out of which u get 24 gb to use...and 3 gb ram of which nearly 1 gb ram is always free on heavy usage also... Themepark has nyc themes fonts, games are running smooth.. Infrared sensor makes it universal remote.. That's great too... I am using it for a month and enjoying it... I am thinking of posting a video review soon"
1,Video Player is loading.
5,Fantastic phone i m really Happy
1,Writing this review after 4 moths usage.  I have bought this phone for my kids online classes. First one week phone was working fine but then started issues in network connection.

5,First of all after Nokia 1 which launched in India in 2016 after that this is the mobile for new comers or secondary phone users. Till date i was using Nokia 1 as secondary mobile. But now i am upgrading it to Nokia c01 plus.. Nokia 1 will be for my young son...Now to the point as always Nokia Love it Trust It Keep it.... Nice Phone. Thanks Nokia A Lot.... Thanks Amazon... I am thinking to purchase another Nokia c01 plus during Great Indian Festival Sale on Amazon........
5,"Likes - Lightweight ui , nokia signature sound , plastic build but good.Cons - lots of bloatware apps installed while setting up the phone , all can be uninstalled . Facebook can only be disabled .Don't expect any heavy duty performance from this , this is good for basic tasks , light web browsing , WhatsApp etc."
5,ProsGood price rangeVery light weightGood for persons shifting from basic phones to andriodCornFull Charge takes about 2 hoursOverall a very good buy in this price range.
1,"Actually, I received  this product on dated 22 September 2020 on 8.30 PM. you can check mobile activation by EMI number.Then I activated  mobile on 09.15 PM same day.Next day around 4.30 to 5.30 PM when i saw Mobile is automatically Switched off.I think Battery is drained then i charged mobile. when charging is complete then i felt Mobile cover is hot. I tried to start mobile but not start. After 2 to 3 time start attempts then Mobile Start.Then every day same problem.Now last 2 days Mobile Screen completely Off.Try more time to Start but Mobile and Screen is not start.I was comminucate to Amazon Customer Care but they did not answer."
4,"Pros -The phone is very good in the price range.It is light weight.Battery, camera and display is decent.Viewing angles are good.You get clean android 11 experience, you can install regular apps also, not only go versions.Cons -It comes many bloatware apps, you can uninstall some, rest you have to disable.Mobile device manager app automatically installs useless apps and makes phone slow and heated.Now coming to the heating issue.To solve this, please disable the Mobile Manager app from settings -> installed apps -> system apps, this app is using very large amount of data and installing bloatware apps automatically, leading to heating. I don't know why a company like Nokia used this cheap tactic."
1,The first thing I observed after unpacking the phone is the poor design and horrible touch display. The phone started to heat after using it for 15 minutes.Only advantage I could think of is it's good wifi range and Stock OS.Regretting my purchase already! üòî
1,"The video quality is totally poor. The video call through WhatsApp is a frustrating experience. Half the video coming in black shadow. Frequent call drops, poor network reception. When phone is locked and you get a WhatsApp or telegram call, you won't get a notification. Camera quality is very disappointing. I never thought Nokia will bring such a piece of junk and Amazon would sell it too."
5,"This is a budget handset. It makes no sense to compare with other budget handsets, because there are no software updates available in other handsets. This serious security flaw is not there in Nokia handsets. Even Samsung rarely updates their budget phones. None of the chinese companies update their budget phones, so you are stuck with whatever software you have today. Also, default Android Go interface is fairly easy and fast to use.Pros:1. Nice IPS display for the price.2. Back camera is ok3. Touch is responsive and phone is reasonably fast.4. Made in India, non-chinese phone5. Useful for people who want to reduce smartphone usage, yet have a practical device.6 Rear camera is recessed, so phone can be placed flat on table, without need for additional back cover.7. Rear cover is textured, so gives nice grip and no smudges.8. Software! Nokia regularly updates their software, so you always have latest versions.Cons:1. Front camera is poor. Haven't tried with front flash2. Lots of bloatware (Can all be uninstalled however). Why Nokia, why?I received a phone which was opened and repacked. There were smudges on the screen and  it was clearly repackaged. The phone works fine, so no complaints."
4,"The phone is value for moneyüëç... There are some bloatwares like some alternatives of tiktok but they can be uninstalled....the phone has very basic features with Android 11 GO that is a lite version of Android 11. The camera is OK. The only problem is with the OS itself where it feels as if I'm using an unstable beta version of the OS. Some apps and functions crash sometimes(but are tolerable) and that is only due to the OS software and nothing to do with the hardware(because I have a redmi 5A with little bit lower specs than this nokia, but still works smooth n stable(p.s. I have installed a custom ROM in that))But I will certainly say that Nokia has managed it well to create an affordable smartphone that has the security of Android 11 and the simplicity for the indian public. You can't get this combination easily in the indian market. If some issue goes intolerable then I am going to install custom ROM and solve the issueüôÇ."
1,There seems to be some issue with the hardware. It shows vertical bands while making video calls. The lower part of the video appears dull. I got it replaced but the problem is same with the replaced one. There is no return option.
1,"DO NOT BUY- WORST PHONE OF THE YEAR. Problems are- body heating with little bit of use, software hang and after that amazon technician will be start a question and answer session and at last they will be prove that customer is wrong.So, Do not buy this phone. WORST PRODUCT."
1,"Very pathetic bult quality, hangs all the timeThere is a feature to record calls from unknown numbers. The amazing thing is other person will also know that you are recording this call. Be careful this might your relationship with peopleIn my case, I was not aware who enabled and I was using this phone for 2 months. I will have to call allof them let them know that it was mistake"
4,"this is a pretty good phone for its price, it can be better with some quality of life improvements like  a type-c port and a finger print reader"
1,It's just only phone don't buy this
4,"bought it for my dad, very light weight and battery friendly. good for one hand use with clean android. one thing is missing - finger print sencor."
5,Good for first time users and elders. Considerably quick as it uses Android 11 Go version.Lacks fingerprint reader but compensates with face unlock.
3,"If you want to purchase a secondary phone for calls and messages, this is the right phone for you. Light weight, good battery back-up, stock android, no bloatware."
2,Phone is good light weight but upset with camera
1,"Phone has video call issue, during video call half screen will have black shadow."
1,Camera is worst during video calls. Over heats. NOT RECOMMENDED even for first time android users. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY DON'T WASTE LIKE I DID.
1,Not at all value to mobile what the use I buyed on 28 sept and it's 23 Oct so many failiuraty coming to the device it's so frustrating
2,Over heating problem ...when am watching YouTube the phone automatically heating
4,Wish ear phone & back cover was available.
5,Nice pic
5,All features are good to use as a smart phone
5,Best mobile at this price range
5,Best budget smartphone.
4,"good phone at this budget, but camera quality is not good."
5,Binod.
4,"We haven't seen the ‚ÄòPrime' branding on a Redmi smartphone in a really long time, but now Xiaomi has brought it back with the Redmi 9 Prime. Xiaomi explains that this model has been launched because its Redmi Note 9 series has become more expensive due to the GST hike and Rupee-Dollar fluctuations. The Redmi 9 Prime is priced below the Redmi Note 9 series and starts just below the Rs. 10,000 price point. Has Xiaomi gone overboard with cost-cutting, or does the Redmi 9 Prime offer you good value for money? I review the new Redmi 9 Prime to find out.At the beginning of our Redmi 9 Prime review, we stated that the smartphone is a prime contender for the best smartphone under Rs 10,000 currently in India. Redmi 9 Prime is a budget all-rounder that ticks most boxes right with its value-for-money performance package.The camera unit may not be the best but it gets the job done. The lack of night mode is a bummer though. You can pick Xiaomi‚Äôs own Redmi Note 9 (review) that gets points for its big battery, decent display and an above-average performance unitI bought it for youtube review but it changed me"
1,This phone is unnecessary creating black market ...By launching the phn in flash sale 90% phone are booked by bookies and sell in open market for Rs1000-2000 extra cost. I stopped using Redmi everyone should also do so.
5,nice camera
4,Good but camera quality not good
3,Only name change by mi . Not as expected
1,"At A price Point of 12000 this is definitely not a best phone because In Box Only 10W Normal charger is available2- At 12000 , How a 13 MP CAMERA IS worth?Narzo Is a better deal than this at 12000rs"
5,"Hi Guys  I write this review to encourage you to buy this Powerful Processor Smartphone with easily enough 5020Mah Battery with Full HD Plus Display, proves that it is one and only Real Value of Money Budget Smartphone of Covid19 infected year 2020. Must buy it before MI increases its price from Rs 9999 to Rs 10999.However, I'll recommend everyone to buy a 4GB Ram 64GB Variant as one has to pay Rs 2000 more for increasing only 64GB Storage to 128GB Storge and for Rs 11999 we have available Realme Nazro 10 with more Powerful Quad Camera along with 18W Fast Charger for which one has to Spnd more Rs 600 more to purchase separately for RedMi Prime Customer! Same difference also in Rear Camera also as Realme provides 16MP while RedMi 9 Prime only 8MP! It must be mentioned here that Camera Quality of RedMi 9 Prime is worth of Money if you buy 64GB Variant!In short, I'll recommend to everyone to buy this Smartphone before it's price hike as after increasing GST to 18% it has become just a Dream to buy a Smartphone with Powerful Battery back up, Powwrful Processor HelioP80, Quad Camera and Full HD Display!Thanks for reading my review!"
5,Only camera quality is poor.  Other all are good.
2,"Pros.* Perfect P2i Protection*  Low Rate* Good build quality for this price* Android 10* MIUI 11 { waiting for miui 12 }Cons.* camera is below average* Average display quality* No earphones in the box* OVER HEATING* Takes very long time to charge battery.* Poor audio qualityIf your are planning to buy for students { Online class }, its worthless."
4,good but not as advertised.camera is just ok
5,"I have never seen this type of mobile under this price. Because so many specifications in addition with FHD+ IPS DISPLAY.Coming to gaming (#PUBG) awesome yaar playing HD with High graphics smoothly (@G80 powerful gaming Processor). Coming to battery it takes 1:30 min approximately from 30% to 100%.paking also super received two days earlier. U know one thing u can't find another mobile under 10k with this type of specifications (hoping in the future also).If my review helps you to clarify what type of smartphone  you are looking for that makes me very happy.Overall :Best budget phone (@pisa vassol)Long lasting battery, Super for gaming, camera also good not bad, fast charging, fast unlocking fingerprint sensor, type-C. Overall I loved it, Thank you Amazon."
5,"By good luck, I was able to get this phone in the third flash sale. Earlier i had participated in two flash sale but the phone was going out of stock in a few seconds. I am very happy with this phone. it is performing very well. no other company are providing great specifiation in this price segment as this phone has. this phone has media tek helio G 80 processor, full hd plus display, quad camera setup along with 13 mp primary camera and 8 mp selfie camera. phone comes with 5020 mah battery with 18 watt type c fast charging support.however in box you will get 10 watt charger but you can buy quick charge 3.0 (18watt) charger on mi store in only 500rs.  but there is one issue for those customer who are interested to buy this phone is that, black marketing is going on. offline seller buy this phone by the help of their group network on telegram and whatsapp by giving some money to console and sell it by overprice. thus the customer who truly need this phone are returning disappointed. i think COD option should be disable to stop black marketing."
5,"Good mobile, Quality is good. Colour of mobile awesome, budget price, Battery Backup is good, Camera Average."
5,Outstanding mobile... In 10000....4gB 64 gB varriant....
1,"Have tried in 3 flash sales, right from 10 minutes before to 1 hour after the flash sale went live. Stock is 100 Percent claimed already when sale starts, there is no option given even for a fraction of second to add to cart.It is a fake sale just to increase its brand image. Disappointed. Disgusting. Ratings are only 52 after 3 flash sales, that itself tells the story.If the stock went out just after it started and ratings are only 52, what sale is it making, keeping 10 units for each flash sale?There is no news on how many sales are made in each flash sale, that speaks for itself."
4,Money worthy deal . Awesome
1,I Quite Disappointed with it because1- In Box Only 10W Charger is provided2- Only 13 MP CAMERA IS AVAILABLE AT 12000WHERE AS IN NARZO10 48MP MAIN CAMERA IS AVAILABLE AT 12000I suggest to only 10000Rs vaireny
1,This product is very very very bad quality.Made in china but not india
4,"During normal usage this phone gets heat up  upto 40 degree CelsiusAnd during charging it's charger heats very highAnd this phone's battery  last long only for 22 hours if we use for normal task only.Is that heating issue is common or it's a defective piece ?Update:- I got replacement of redmi 9 prime on 21 sep 2020 and this time product is perfectIt gives great backup of 1day 5 hours with heavy usage (i.e online classes, YouTube, unacademy etc)Phone doesn't heat but still charger heats"
4,"The best phone to buy under 10K Category, Back Panel is of Plastic Material, Glass or Metal would be very nice, battery drains a little fast, Sound Ok, Display Ok, Camera performance is also good, images are a little over-processed but looks good, No headphone inside the box Transparent back cover is present inside the box."
5,this product is awesome.camera is 2/5battery 4/5performance 5/5Design  5/5
1,"Really Disappointed by Amazon sent me""Made¬†In¬†China"" product!No ""Made¬†in India by Redmi"" ? (the reason, I selected Redmi. but disappointed)Giving '1star' because,no '0 star' option is there!!!![1. Giving 1star to 'made¬†in¬†china'.2. Not reviewing for 'Quality & all']"
2,Look wise good. Design also good. Ordered on prime days sale got product on almost 15 days later. Games: - U can't play pubg on high settings. Yes daily task easily do.System os: miui have too much ads.Charging: its take almost 3+ hour to full charge could be give atleast 18w charger in the box.Display : is good fhd norch.Storage type: emmc so read and write speed slow..I don't recommend ..
1,I want to purchase this phone but in flash sale i dont able to puchase so i purchase other phone from flipkart.
4,"I am writing this review after+ 20 days of purchase....i am satisfied with the quality of 9prime its is superb in case of gaming display and camera also..i think redmi should provide 18W charge in box. it's good option for everyone but there one more option NARZO 20 in 10500 /- it's also a great deal as campared to ,9 prime 6000 mah battery , 48mp cam. And 18W charge in box....."
5,Nice phone
4,"No doubt....Redmi 9 Prime is the most budget friendly handset...you get decent quality specs, type-c port and a 1080p display just for 10k !! Everything's good....no need to talk about every sepc one by one separately. Except the only downside being camera...but that is acceptable....you cant get high quality sensors for 10k. Not much bloatwares...no banned apps...no adds...almost clean ui experience...no heating issue.For me, It beats any of its competitors like Narzo 10, 10a, C3 and other similars.  Dont waste money on  downgrade phones like Redmi 9, 9a etc. Now if you compare it with recently launched narzo 20a in this price, yes narzo has better battery but remember it doesnt have FHD display, so you wont get quality video and graphics intense gaming experience and there is not very huge difference between 12mp and 48mp camera, So make choice between better battery or better multimedia.The only reason I have given one star less is because of the price. The price of 64gb variant is abolutely amazing but not for 128gb one and I am reviewing for latter. For 128gb variant, either there should have been more 2gb of ram with a fast charger or the price should have been 11k. Xiomi is charging extra 2k just for extra 64gb storage, totally dishonest.Tip : Using a lite UI like Evie launcher and lite keyboard can help free some amount of ram and extend battery backup.Thank You"
1,Redmi 9 Prime is a Scam I'll try all sales but I don't buy it just 12 o'clock this sale was all claimed no option for buy or add to cart it's a Scam
4,So I was looking for a budget smartphone and redmi 9 prime was the best option among other phones available at the same price range.
1,Very bad quality battery and from 10% too 100% charging take more than 3 hrs. And battery backup very bad üëéüëéüëéüëé
5,"The product is nice with great battery ,and the mostly insane killer looks.Camera is not as bad as everyone is sayingMeanwhile u can't expect more in this price rangeOverall best package in this price segment"
1,Don't go for this if you are looking for good camera. Photos of this Mobile aren't hoto the mark. So I would not recommend to buy this mobile.
5,Excellent phone i love it in this price
2,There is no made in india label on the phone . I think I get old storage. The box and phone is labelld with made in China label. How it is happened??The phone details shows the manufacturer is in Andrapradesh. But i got the phone manufactured in china..? Is it legal?? Any problem with using with this phone???
4,"Five stars for Full hd display, battery backup,fast chargerTwo stars for user interface, yellow page app with call application is huge privacy concerncan't forcestop annoying inbuilt waste app, forced MI apps over other apps"
5,Best in Class
5,Very good
5,A good handy set and have so many features
5,Battery backup is outstanding
2,"Whats the main use of a phone? To make a phone call right?. The sound quality is so very poor. I have to sit in a closed room with absolutely no disturbance(even switch of the fan) to be able to hear the other person clearly. Even by connecting to the bluetooth headphone i find it difficult to hear the other person. After buying the phone i realised, that 5G in india isnt going to be launched in the next 3-4years. To make this phone a 5G phone at a afforadable rate they have compromised on the display, the charging speed the sound.I am stuck with the phone because amazon has a replacement policy and not a return policy which i also realised after buying the phone.I wouldnt recommend it to people for sure.i am samsung has much better models"
5,"Today purchase  this phone,good overall. Nice product, camera  clarity  also good.Light weight  model with Samsung brand ,gray color  also nice.."
2,Battery is worst even if you are using randomly still Less than a Day .Apps are not working properly getting struck though it is a new phone can buy better phone in the same price .Really disappointed with Samsung device

1,Mobile gets hang often gets multi colour display heats up while charging
2,Third class product don't Purchase... Software issue sound problem..A series is worst... Don't go for Samsung... Writing this after 2 week use... Samsung looted my 18500
1,Finger print not working face reader also not working I want replacement of mobile
4,"The phone is good,  attractive and easy to operate .  Camera quality is superb.Phone charging is slow as it comes with 9V adapter.  It takes 2 hours to charge 100% . I did not like about Charger cable is, its very short,  atleast 1.25 mtr cable is required . Phone doesn't come with earphones which is very weird after paying so much money . It could be more better as expected from Samsung. I took this because it is 5G."
1,* Charger is not good not working and not effective*And the charger is not active in the phone*The battery life is very low andpoor*Only we are using the phone for one hour and The charge is not remaining in the phone for 24hours*This is the problem please  take an immediate  solution for my problem
5,"Liked. Excellent and fantastic phone.There are many tones available in this phone.Select suitable one according to the premises and environment. A louder ringtone shall satisfy all their needs. Further it is stated that BSNL 4G sim is not receiving calls in the 5G samsung galaxy A22. But Jio is giving good reception.If BSNL 4 G sim is provided, it always show as ""Net work not registered"". The cretarian may kindly be clarified."

1,"I didn't expect this quality from samsung. The screen always get hanged. You have to switch off screen to get it again live. Display is poor. The audio is not good. Max volume is so low that you have to often use earphone or other devices. Only the camera quality is good. Overall, it is not worth your money."
4,"Galaxy A22 5G makes it to India, complete with 11 5G bands. So I like itBut...Battery life is everage,Camera quality not suitable,Memory value is excellent."

5,"This mobile looks very beautiful.the mint color gives a vibrant look.camera, battery are good enough for daily usage.picture quality is very clear.my wife loves this a lot."
1,Selfie camera  poor in quality

5,"This is my honest review after using it for 20 days, in this price range it is best one,the only problem i faced was the ear pain, couldn't wear it for more than 2 minutes, its too much tight, so i made it loose by putting it on my book for 48 hours, rest is good, price, sound, clarity, bass and wire length."
1,It has stopped working within warranty period and Amazon does not show option to return or replace it within warranty period.
1,Received second hand headphone
4,"Im going to give a small comparison of this product with two of the headphones i have been using recently.This includes Samsung level u ( rs 2249/) and the ant audio w56 in ear wired earphone ( rs 599/)ProsDecent build qualityExcellent sound qualityApt for watching movies.Soft cushioningMicGood quality cableConsExternal noices creeps in a lot ( less noice cancellation effect).Jack is not gold plated, but I won't complain about it because the gold plating on most of the jacks of headphones in this price range will wear off after a months usage.On comparing the boat bass heads 900 with the ones mentioned above, I noticed that the bass levels were pretty much equal between the ant audio w56 and boat bass heads 900. Samsung level u has the least bass compared to the other 2In terms of audio quality, the boat bass heads and Samsung level u are in the same level, the clarity of sound is a bit less in the ant audio w56 compared to the boat .For outdoor use, I would prefer the ant audio w56 as it has better noice cancellation compared to the boat.ComfortI have read some reviews complaining about the boat bass heads 900 that it pains in the ears after a few minutes of usage. But I have not experienced such problems.Build qualityThe plastics used is not the best, but acceptable. Ear pads are well cushioned.SummaryOverall a really decent product from boat, excellent sound clarity and good bass makes it good for watching movies. Most suitable for indoor usage, good value for money ( bought it for 799 but will be available for 599 at certain times.)Audio quality 4/5Bass 3.8/5Value for money 4/5Comfort 4/5Build quality 3.7/5Thank you for your time."
4,"The Boat bass heads really live up to their name by providing amazing Bass for music lovers.Pros:1. The design is stylish, especially the white one.2. The headphone is easily foldable making it convenient to carry.3. Mic for calls.4. Excellent Bass.5. Very Cheap (Bought for around 900 during sale).6. Durable and lengthy Cable.Cons:1. You cannot wear it for more than one hour, beyond which your ears start hurting due to the tight design.2. Slight distortion at 100% sound levels."
1,"exactly after 30-32 days,mic problem, in-line mic not working, and when connected headphones it automatically mutes all volume by reducing audio levels automatically, tested on different mobile phones, problem not solved. Microphone either works or speakers. cannot use headphones for calling purpose. Your voice is not delivered to other end with this headphones. Now I don't have option for replacement or return. Obviously the seller will tell me to go to BoAt service center which is in mumbai city as shows google map and I live in Pune city. Very bad experience, my all money is wasted by this BoAt brand, I should have bought Audio Technica or scullcandy branded headphones in this same price segment. Utterly disappointing."
1,I had just got this headphones day before yesterday and by seeing them i was happy as they look cool  ...But honestly i will tell u that as  i wear these headphones like just for 2-4minutes while listening songs...my ears start paining and i remove them but still pain was there for a long time for that day .but  yeah song quality is good but still they pain..now today i had request for return of this item
4,"I got this headphone for 599.the build quality of this thing is pretty good it feels solidBass is amazing and overall quality of the sound is also nice no doubt.I am very satisfied with boAt's after sales services.my Headphone got an issue with sound (unfortunately) don't worry that doesn't mean you will also have the same issue it was just a 1 in million caseso I went to service center and without asking a single question they got me replaced with another headphones.one more thing I have to mention that you may feel discomfort after wearing the headphones for quite long, because it is slightly tight, may be eventually it will get loose."
1,Please don't purchase this product. The one side speaker is off within 2 months. The call was disconnected after connecting this headphones.Very bad product.
4,Awesome Sound but jack is not gold plated!
5,It's a original boat product ... Made in China.... Sound quality is awesome ... Disadvantage- It's going blow ur ears... If u don't like bass then don't buy it
5,"Let us go through the advantage and disadvantageAdvantage1) Value for money Head set that is a bass monster and clarity is awesome2) It has a bundled mike so that you can use it to pick up your call on mobile as well.3) Snug fit to the ear and really responsive sound volumeDisadvantage1) NoneI would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a new headset with mike phone. The music quality is mind blowing, awesome."
3,The sound quality is excellent but it hurts the ear lobes after wearing them for 30 mins. Need to put extra cushioning the ones available are not enough. Also it does not have the volume buttons included.making it difficult. Otherwise it's a good buy.
5,If u love listening music... If good sound quality .. Good bass matters to u.. Then definitely buy these Headphones.. Extremely good bass and sound quality .. Durable.. Looks wise really awesome.. Noise cancelation is super awesome.. Don't think just go for it guys.. U won't regret buying these headphones at all.. Grantee..
4,"Everything is good about this headphone. The clarity, noise reduction, bass is all perfect. However after using it for a month the left side stopped working. I raised a complaint with BOAT and within 2 weeks I got a replacement. I appreciate the customer service by BOAT."
1,"The worst headphones i ever bought. Bought these headphones for ‚Çπ749 and when i got delivery the left side of the earphones was giving distorted soundVery bad experience with boat , No sound clearity and no bass quality , its a useless productI m wondering whats the quality checking of this brand , they dont even test their products single time , very bad experience with boat"
5,"I liked the super bass feature and the attached microphone. I purchased SONY headphones and before the year ended and the warranty was over, it was completely DEAD. I hope that BOAT does not end up with the same fate. As one consumer mentioned in the review, when he contacted the makers of the headphone complaining that he should get a replacement for the faulty headphones, the company immediately arranged for a new one. The same happened with me with the SONY product but I got terribly pained running from pillar to post to get a replacement. It NEVER happened. Go for BOAT headphones. They are a value for money. I invested Rs. 799/- and I am truly satisfied with both the microphone and the speaker quality. Thumsb Up !!!"
5,Best In Class.For 799 Rs (Superdeal) I am shocked with its bass and really suggest you to buy. It also comes with a mic for great hands free voice chat.
5,Very nice headphone for all pubg mobile players.. I used to use scullcandy headphone before but the way this headphone work is brilliant.. I can identify footsteps and bullets direction more accurately than before.. Only problem is that if you have by mistakely kept high volume and if you fire akm then it might hurt your ears coz already this is a bass headphone and akm or M762's sound is very high which can give you headache or short-term deafening.. So take care of that.. Overall the product is good
1,"Please don't buy this, The product was good, worked well for two weeks. Then suddenly mic was not working. We tried contacting the customer service for Boat. But no response. Service center also not picking up call. Don't know what to do with this product now, as can't return also already crossed the return timeline due to followup with customer service since three weeks. But no action was taken. Also this is made in China. So suggest don't waste your money for this product."
5,Good Product decent sound Quality in this price range its way beyond expectations. Must Buy for Pure Bass Lovers
5,it has a very nice look and it's worth of money..go for it and there is no chance of repent..
5,"I have purchased white one first and I fall in love with sound quality,build quality,n amazing bass , theater like surrounding sound clarity ant that too at so much reasonable price....immidiatly after a month I got black color n gifted it . Planning to give one more gift to sister....my smiling face talk more than star rating as it's project happy customer experience..... instead of purchasing a earphone worth 500 upgrade to Boat 900 extra bass headphones with microphone.... awesome quality in terms of product,sound,look, comfort with microphone usp at low price point...will add soon after six months another review after using...this is one month review and genuine review from user....."
1,"I bought boAt headphone few months back, not more than 6 months. But its right side damaged and sound is not coming. Now what I shall do? I can't take this and go for a service centre to my nearest town which is 90 km away from my place of residence. Only thing I do is I purchase another headphone either from Sony or Phillips. I advice all not to go for boAt headphones. They are not reliable. This is my experience"
4,Good looking headphone with mic.Sound quality is awesome
3,To be honest you guys this headphone sound quality is horrible too much treble I see all other people claiming it has a allot of base but no I‚Äôm a base lover there‚Äôs no base if you higher up the volume it hurts the ear I didnt expect this I wanna exchange already! This was my first headphone I purchased and Im totally disappointed since I use my apple earpiece it sounds much better than this headphone such a waste of money ! Now another issue it stop working within a month and there is no option to replace also this is a horrible experience ever like thus are the worst thing I‚Äôve ever bought online. Don‚Äôt buy it amazon lies!!! There was no option for warranty since they didn‚Äôt gave any bill or nothing !!
4,"Editing this review after 10 months, so starting with the pro'sSo the Audio quality is good you'll get surrounding feel where it's needed & if you are bass lover then you will like it very much, watching Hollywood movies on it feels great.Build quality is also good, most of the components made with plastic and then some metallic & the cushions are soft and their material quality is also good.Now the conseven though its cushions are soft this headphone is painfull for your ears if you are using it continuously, headphone fits much more tighter on your ears than it has to be so thats why...I was using this headphone with Lenovo vibe K4 note and suddenly it stopped working with it, it was working fine with every other device but stopped working on my device, even my device working well with every other headphones even i tried another bassheads 900 and it was working with my device but my bassheads 900 stopped working with my phone... i know its strange.Then few months later right side of headphone stopped working and then soon after left side gave up.Boat seems very good build quality and sound quality but i experienced 8 out of 10 headphones of boat stops working after some period, But the best thing is if your headphones gets any issue within 1 year then you'll get brand new headphones from Boat, you just have to register product and ask for replacement with details of your headphone issue.Even i got replacement for my product & it's been 2 years since i purchased this headphone and they are working super fine although i had to replace them once because of issue mentioned above."
2,"I bought these for my Son. Both of us use the headphones.The sound quality for the price range is excellent. It got a good Bass, treble could have been sharper. However the biggest issue with this headset, is that it's too tight on the ears ( and I dont have a very big face ).After about 5 mins, your ears start to hurt ( literally hurt ).So while, the sound may be good, it's of no use when you cannot use the head set for more than 10 minutes at a stretch.2 stars only for the reason that these headsets are practically un-usable due to being too tight."
5,"I have been using the headphones since two days and I must say I am quite impressed. By looking at the photos of the product, I thought these are huge headphones. I was equally surprised to see the small box it came in when opened the Amazon packaging. After I took it out of the box, it felt really light in weight. The build quality of the headphones is good. You don‚Äôt feel in anyway that you are holding a cheap product. The fit is really snug. Good amount of cushioning for your years. There is a little bit of cushioning for the headband too which suffices the need. About the sound quality: Listening to music felt good. Nice bass, treble is good, you can hear every sound and tune clearly. However, I felt it needed a bit more sharpness. But hey, what all can you expect from a product at this price. I used it for calls. Voice quality is good. There is a fair amount of booze cancellation on the headphones. Microphone is powerful too. Overall and excellent product for its price. If you are looking for a over the ear headphones and for a good price.... this is your choice."
3,"(Ok so, headphones you buy should be based on who you are (music producer, audio engineer, DJ or a regular person).For non-music produces (normal people):This headphone is ideal for you. Please don't go for studio-quality or expensive headphones for only listening to music (because expensive headphones are for music producers and require a huge amount of power that can't be used with mobile). It comes with a small microphone in one of the wires, is foldable (easy to store even in small bags). BUT, the ear cups are really small to my ears, get heated quickly, so you can't wear it for a long time comfortably. This headphone can be used with all devices and doesn't need a lot of power like the expensive ones. And if you listen to podcasts, I don't recommend it because it is uncomfortable to wear and has bad noise cancellation feature. But if you use headphones for meetings and listening to music, this is perfect for you.For music producers and mixing engineers:I do not recommend these headphones for you. Because if we see the frequency response, it plays sounds from 20-10000 Hz (as far as I can hear). But it plays bass sounds more than other frequencies which can make you biased and wrong decisions while making music and mixing/mastering. Anywhen it comes to power, it is 80 ohms. So please don‚Äôt buy ANY cheap headphones for music producing and I recommend buying headphones that have frequency response clearly mentioned (20Hz to 20000Hz is good) with 250 ohms. Such studio-quality headphones are not cheap though. You can see more studio-quality headphone suggestions for producer s on YouTube.Hope this helps :)"
1,I cannot hear any music from the right side
5,"I will come straight to the point. These are infact a great pair of headphones - but only when you are traveling or require active noise cancellation. Otherwise these are just a decent pair.I have been using this for a while with my laptop & iPhone, for watching Netflix & Prime Video (The Audio Source is anyways brilliant) & listening to music on Prime Music, again, the audio source is great, so I have got a decent experience with the headphones, with nice bass & decent mids. But when you turn the Active noise cancellation, the experience is in a different league - You wont hear any other voice in your vicinity. I have tested this in multiple flights as well. Even if you just turn the noise cancellation on, without any music, it will give a surreal experience, you won't be able to hear any in-cabin flight noise (engines etc.) It has actually helped me have a nice in-flight experience whether to just sleep or watch any movie.Two things which could have been improved upon are -1. With out Noise cancellation listening experience.2. Re chargeable inbuilt battery could have been used."
5,"I have been using BOAT earphone since early thosand 18. And believe me guys this is truly beyond awesome. This is my first purchase after using SONY headphone, SONY is far behind from BOAt, as what i think, after using earphone/headphone of BOAT. I went for this headphone after earpiece of boAt & this is mind boggling. What a sound quality, Hats off 2 the makers of boAt. Awesome bass, treble , u r gonna hear each n every penny of sound clearly. U r gonna be totaly cutoff urself from outer world once u wear this headphone. Its material quality is very good, its totaly durable, light weight. I am giving this review after using 2 week. Dont hesitate go for it guys."
1,"The ear-piece is so tight that ears get hurted within a few minutes of wearing it. It has unnecessary clockwise roation instead of anti-clockwise, such that bottom part of my ear doesn't get surrounded...Even a 5% volume can be heard by a person behind me. And the connector works okay in my laptop, but falls very easily from my mobile phone. Overall product doesn't seems to be sturdy, the wires seems to be can be easily break with just a small strech due to rubber-like substance.Last time I had used Mdr Zx110a which didn't had sound quality as this, but everything was sturdy, comfortable and still working after two years (with 35+ times falls from height and alot of streches), just that it got fungi right now due to moisture conditions...There is no return, only replacement with same product available, I have placed just to be sure if its the problem with only this one or every piece got the same problem."
1,"NOT SATISFIED,1. AMAZING EXPERIENCE WITH MUSIC2. NOT AT ALL GOOD FOR PUBG PLAYERS, YOU WON'T EXPERIENCE BACKGROUND MUAIC OF PUBG LIKE FOOT STEPS ECT.3. MUSIC LEAKS VERY MUCH4. MINE STOPPED WORKING UNDER 20 DAYS5. IF YOU USE IT ROUGHLY THE AUX WILL DEFINITELY GET DAMAGE6. THE CORD WIRE IS VERY VERY VERY LONG, WHICH IS VERY IRRITATING.SOME LAST LINES:-:-ONLY GOOD FOR MUSIC LOVERS, WHICH USE IT RARELY. NOT GOOD FOR GAMING OR ANYTHING ELSE.BE FREE TO ASK ANYTHING ELSE ON MY INSTAGRAM :- ayaanshaikh106"
5,So lets start with build quality it just perfect easily foldable and very light weight had a soft metal strip at top which adjustable according to your head.. the ear coups are small so had some problems with them so there is con and this is only con if u listen to music a lot it best to avoid this since long hours of usage causes pain especially near the ear drum ... Except all the sound quality is just amazing 10/10 for that boat .. also the bass is really good u wiuld be satisfied with that also had a microphone which sounds ok..
4,I am not any critec but on common standpoint I love the feel of this headphone and it has good price to I will definitely suggest this headphone to friends
1,Honestly i didn't like the product at all.. the bass is not good as it claims high bass sound quality.. it's just ok.. secondly I couldn't even wear the headphone for even 5 min.. my ears started to pain.. i tried many times that that's what it is.. the ear pains.. i wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.. 749rs. Is not a small amount that can wasted on products like this..  A big No from my side..
4,"This Boat Ear phone  of mine stopped working in the Mid of April 2020.  It did'nt strike me then to check for the warranty period due to this Covid-19 lock down. Now that I am checking the old orders, I find that its just one year since I brought this product and the warranty too is 1 year.  It lasted exactly for 1 year not more not less. So the immediate question that comes to my mind is ""Is this the quality of a reputed company ""Boat"" ? I have just missed the boat by few days and that too due to this Covid-19 lockdown. Will this qualify for replacement? Please let me know."
1,"Writing this review after using this headphone for 4+ months.Pros:Build and cable quality is good, no wear and tear in cables.Tangle free.Cons:Absolutely 0 on noise cancellation. At 20% volume level, anyone near you can hear everything.Painful to use for longer duration, ears starts hurting as the earpiece is not big enough and sits on the ears.Cannot use it for longer duration.Bass quality and audio quality is average."
1,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.So my ‚Çπ1499 are wasted now..."
2,"[BIG UPDATE] IT BROKE ALONG THE RIGHT HINGE, I WAS WEARING IT NORMALLY AND IT SPLIT OPEN ON ONE SIDE.The extenders are weak. ( Pic inscuded) My boat 400s broke at the centre too. They need to concentrate less on celebrity endorsements and use the profits on materials and quality control. They still worked so I taped it up with a metal sheet. Still will give 2 stars for the sound.[ORIGINAL REVIEW]I've owned boat products such as the Rockerz 400 and some of their earphones and this is the best experience I've had with the product.Review after 1 day of use and will updatePrice I paid 1800Pros:1. Packaging is good for the first time2. The build and finish is on par with headphones costing 3 times as much.3. Range is next level, didn't experience any loss of connection in my entire house with the phone kept in one position.4. Boat headphones have always been super uncomfortable but this time they have actually thought of that.5. The cups are big and soft enough to fit your ears inside so they are over the ear.6. Base is not amazing, let's just say it's above average, the sound is like a 20 % improvement on the Rockerz 400.7. They have gone for a organic approach for the sound so the highs and lows are just ok .9. Battery life is just as advertised8. You literally can't find a better pair of headphones for less than 3k  for sure.Cons1. I was not sure about how they actually look when I ordered cos the image of the product kept changing, it had flat cups and then doughnut type cups.2. It's not as loud as I want it to be3. They didn't include a aux Cable which is crazy as they ship those with all other models.4. It does get warm in these and you will sweat5. No noise cancelling as they mentioned and passive design is not that good"
5,"This is a premium quality product from boAt-Lifestyle. It's professional grade 40 mm drivers truly deliver you to a music nirvana with a professional fine finish. The amazing battery life and the reduced charge time makes it a marathon runner. The ear cushion provides a comfy experience. The sound quality is fabulous and does not give a pain in the ear. It also is easy to carry around as it folds inwards, it also fold towards the sides which makes it extremely easy and safe to keep on a table. All over it is an awesome product."
1,"The boAt Rockerz line is boAt's super cheap lineup for budget buyers. This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is  not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are  entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save  up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones. The only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?1 Build"
5,"These are super comfortable and premium looking headphones. Beautifully designed with very good matt finishing.Sound quality is top notch, good for pop songs.

1,Never have I seen as fragile headphone as this one. I have been delivered a product with manufacturing defect or it already damaged. The bud from the right side fell off as soon as I unpacked the headphones. Boat rockerz has not been upto my expectation. Think before buying.
5,Material is very poor quality but service also very good. Product replace after 10 month even broken. Now condition is new..üëç
1,"Poor build quality. One side of the headphone broke down with normal usage within one month of operation. Never expected such a poor quality from boat. To make matters worse, in entire Hyderabad they have only one service centre which is far away at 15 Kms from the city"
3,"At 1999 they are decent.Pros1. Light weight because made of plastic2. Battery super cool @ 70 hrs3. I am happy at 40% volume, so they are super loud.4. They have thumping base5. Call quality is good for this price.6 connect easily and the Bluetooth range is excellent. I have tried them keeping my iphone in another room and roaming around the home. No distortion or disconnection.7. They fold so are easy to carryCons:1. Plasticky so can break any time2. Vocals are not clear and are dull. If they had crisp vocals, these would have been the best in the industry.3. They would need time to open up. For my ears they feel stiff and tend to heat after 2-3 hrs of continuous usage. Ears pain after this much usage.4. No case or pouch but was not expecting eaither at this price.Over all a decent product in the price range and can keep it as a spare headphone in my bag if i forget my primary headphones (Marshall Monitor BT) knowing they will always have some charge ( 70 hrs battery at 60% volume)"
3,"I bought this 3 months back and it's broken now as it was all plastic and not much flexible. The product says we have 1-year warranty but physical damage isn'tincluded. Bad experience. I have fixed it with fevi quick as a temporary solution, but I don't know how much time it would work.üò¢"
1,"It has got broken, very bad quality cheap product"
5,"I am using Sony Headphones for over 2 years now, which were sufficiently good for me. They got damaged somehow, and new sony wireless  headphones costed a whole lot than this headphone so I would've had to buy the wired ones, so went for boat. So I'll be comparing these with Sony wired headphones in the same price range (<2000) (believe me, I've used all variants/models)Pros:1. The look: The Black ones that I bought look sick. Fallen in love. If you're a black lover like me, go for boat rockerz 450 instead of 510!üñ§2. Bluetooth: it works crisp. I get range in my whole room and even when I keep the phone in my room and go into another room. Excellent.3. Price: I got them at ‚Çπ1199 at Republic Day sale 2020. Worth it.4. Aux cable: They provided me the aux cable. Everybody has confusion whether they'll provide or not, but they did to me.5. Sound Quality : Decent. Nice bass. If you have been using earphones, you'll love these headphones.6. Noise cancellation: My Sony ones didn't have noise cancellation but these do, and it's awesome.Cons:1. I've been using Sony and the sound quality of Sony is better than this.2. Bass of the sony headphones was way better than these. Believe me these are not at all bad(you'll love them) but if you are coming from Sony or JBL, you'll get a bit disappointed.3. Latency: If you want to play games with this headphones, you will have to use the AUX cable to do that. Can't play games wireless ly, because the game sound will lag too much, making them unpalatable. I tried PUBG, free fire, call of duty, etc. Nearly all of them. But I'm fine with it really, because when you play games on your phone your phone is in your hand anyway, so use the damn aux cable.Conclusion: I was getting JBL ones for ‚Çπ1999 but didn't go for them because they didn't have aux support. Sony wireless headphones do have it, but they cost a lot more (4000 atleast) so couldn't buy them as well.If you are ok with spending ‚Çπ4000 go with Sony. If you don't really need an aux cable support go with JBL. If you are ok with wired headphones go with Sony wired as they are in the same price range as these.So at this price range, these are literally the best wireless headphones you can buy. If this is your budget, go for it.I find these sexier than boat rockerz 510 but I'm a black lover and this is my opinion.If you found this review helpful, hit a thumbs up and help others."
2,The body is plastic even the piece that is exposed upon extension. So its highly likely  to break! Mine broke and yours might be soon as well. So I'll definitely not gonna recommend this. If you already have them then Good Luck!
5,"‚ö´ SOUND QUALITY - Sound quality is amazing for this price and Virtualization is good .‚ö´ BASS - Average bass not so good or bad, it lies in the middle .‚ö´ COMFORT - Not so comfortable , but it is better than boat rockerz 400 , The ear cups are bigger than boat rockerz 400 .‚ö´ CONNECTIVITY -  Connecting faster to devices . Range is very good , i didn't face any connectivity loss upto 10m and also it has dual pairing feature . There is an audio latency when playing games and No audio latency when watching videos .‚ö´ CONTROLS - It is very easy to control and They have kept multifunctional or integrated controls ( Refer to the booklet provided inside the box ) .‚ö´ MICROPHONE - Mic is good, Not as bad as boat rockerz 400 .‚ö´ NOISE CANCELLATION - They have used passive noice cancellation , It doesn't not seems to reduce any outside unwanted  ambient noises.‚ö´ BATTERY - Standby time is amazing as mentioned by the Boat , Charging time takes upto 2 hrs 30 mins .‚ö´ BUILD QUALITY AND MATERIAL - They have used good plastic material but the slider for adjusting the size of the headphones is not good , the wire gets popped out when sliding . Pls be careful when sliding . The ear cups and headband cushion is soft and sweat proof , the water gets easily evaporated.‚ö´ DESIGN - It features an on-ear design and the ear cups are bigger than boat rockerz 400 . It is light-weight but not a sturdy design , which is not intended for jogging or running purposes . For gym it can be used to do strength or weight training or weight lifiting workouts not for aerobic or cardio workouts . The folding design is amazing for the safety of the headphones , it can be easily folded which is easy to place on the flat surfaces .‚ö´ LOOK - Premium look with matte black finish , looks sexy when wearing the headphones . ‚óºÔ∏è VERDICT : Waited for a long time to get a good wireless heaphone with premium look and design.

1,I brought this headphone few months ago and now it broke. I just took it out n it snapped. Its even in warranty period
1,THREE MAIN DEMERITSüëé NOISE CANCELATION 0% PRODUCT VERY HEAVY AUX CABLE MISSING....... BOAT ROCKERS 400 BEST. ALSO NOT FOLDABLE HEADPHONE. NOICE CANCELATION IS THE MAIN REASON TO BUY BOAT NOT JBL. BUT THIS PRODUCT VERY BAD........
1,"Recently ordered the product so after using it for about 6 hours constantly, here is my review in pros and cons.Pros‚ñ™Comfort level is better than jbl 450 and  previous boat rockerz edition.‚ñ™nice bass and sound quality.‚ñ™premium matte finish.‚ñ™ conectivity is pretty fast and good.Cons‚ñ™sound quality could have been better. i mean bass is good balance is good but sound quality is above average.‚ñ™no aux cable.I majorly bought it for jogging so i will update about battery backup and perfomance of this headphone afterwards.Update: perfect pair of headphones for jogging. Battery backup of 7-8 hours easily. get you through 2 days easily if you are medium user.Edit: 8 months and its broken now. i loved these headphones üò• and now broken. Poor plastic by Boat."
5,"These are the best you can get for the price of 1399/--Sound quality 5/5Used Both wired and via Bluetooth. (Tested wired on the stock aux of boat 400, also a little less bass on Bluetooth but that's expected)-Build 4.5/5Though I trust boAt but the extention of ear cups is via plastic ziplock kind of thing which may lead to early wear and cause headphones to go loose.-Design 5/5 (Over-ear if you don't have large ears)Awesome design and form factor and the cups are comparatively more comfortable and larger than boAt 400.-Inbox contents 4/5The only drawback here is that there is no aux included like in the previous versions but that's not an issue as it was foretold in item description.Edit after a month of through usage :--Comfort 3.5/5Will cause sweating and minor numbness or pain after longer usages i.e. watching complete movies etc.Battery life 5/5Working as described complete 7-8 hours of backup, needless to say it also charges quickly i.e. within 1.5-2 hours.Overall best headphones to get at the price range of 1500/- and below, just wait a bit for lightning deal and viola best offer ever."

4,"Rockerz 450 is my Second Headphone from boAt, other being Rockerz 510.+ Packing - Comes in a great packing which looks good and easy to unpack+ Design - This is a good looking headphone with a cute Circumaural design (not that big as Rockers 510). Graphics over the ear cups is just nice. When I rub my hands over the cups and I could feel the quality of the material. I was late to notice that the cups can be rotated to 180 degrees.+ Comfort - Smaller headphone when compared Rocker 510, still the cups are large and soft enough to impart a Cozy feeling.+ Sound quality - I am using this one for general listening as well as editing my YouTube videos, and the sound quality is good enough for me.+ Volume and Playback Controls - Playback and volume control on the rear side of ear cup lets you skip tracks and adjust the volume.+ Bluetooth - Connectivity is just great. I am able to move within all rooms of a 1500 sqft Floor.+ Battery Life - I recharge the headphone once in 2 days after using it for 7 to 8 hours with intermittent intervals.+ Economic when compared with other brands in this segment.- Noise cancellation is not working as advertised.- The buttons assigned for volume aren't smooth enough and make a uncomfortable noise.VerdictA good looking, easy to carry, quality headphone, recommended for people who are looking for a good quality headphone within Rs. 1200-1600. I bought my piece at Rs. 1499. and when I write this review a week later, I see that the price came to Rs. 1199 as a part of Festival Sale. So, I think this is the best time to buy it.Moreover, Welcome/Exit messages are just Awesome.While we switch on this gadget, a Super Energetic guy says, Power on.

2,"The mic of the headphones doesn‚Äôt seem to be good, a person on call is unable to hear your voice clearly even in a quiet environment. As for a noisy environment, the noise cancellation is pathetic! I fact apparently the background noise is more clear than yours. Good music quality and pretty comfortable though. In all it‚Äôs a good headset not a good headphone."
1,The sound quality is good. Especially the bass is great. But one of the limbs broke after two months of use. I fixed it with fevikwik and tape but it then broke at another part. I had taken extra care handling it but the kind of plastic used is below standards. I mailed BOAT customer support regarding the same and my product was picked up from my address. After a few days I recieved a picture of my product totally damaged with no explanation given and they sent it back to me. Poor experience with the way they handled it. Also the ears start hurting within half an hour of use.
1,This is my 1st time using boat headphone but I shocked when I see I got a headphone which has some minor scratches maybe it's a used. Headphone. I continually use for 10 days. I didn't see any problem in headphone but after 10 days I see that I'm getting a little noice during charging but ignore this sound . Day by day it increasing. One morning  when I woke I see that headphone giving alot of heat but when I open all screw of headphone I see that battery is burned in fire. So don't buy this headphone brand sent me a used headphone.
5,"The product is just amazing!! It comes in a good packaging, has a great colour and I love itüíô. This üéß can be connected to any bluetooth device. It can remain charged for a very long duration. The ear cushions provides a comfy experience. The sound quality is superb. It's noice cancellation allows u to just concentrate and feel the music. It's worth the price I paid. The main thing I bought this is that it had the calling features and it really works. This üéß is completely light weight. The product comes with a charger for charging and an aux cable which can be connected directly to the phone if we want as it saves charging. It also has an information manual and a 1 year warranty card. This product is a Must have!!"
1,"Worst quality .amazon is waste for selling goods and it never meet the requirements of customer ..such a waste product from amazon that I have bought ... I need a replacement of this boat headset otherwise I‚Äôm gonna proceed legally..Loose wire connection and very delicate headset I got ,I mean even if I place it on the bed it broken such a worst product given by amazon ...I‚Äôm going share this review in all websites if u didn‚Äôt respond"
5,"This is nice one, bass is really great and sound also loud, its like mini home theater on your ears. Completely happy with this. Many not suitable for long listening as theses are on ear headphones.Manufacturer package box is perfect. Thanks to Boat"
1,Product material build is the worst of all.The headphones broke into half while adjusting the cups length just after 3 days of using.Recently Boat has been fooling customers with these horrible products that wont last even 3 days.Styrofoam  made products will last longer than these boat products.NEVER GONNA BUY AGAIN FROM BOAT.
1,As u can see...i brought two of them..and after using them for one month... they both broke one way or another...only in sensitive manner...donno why company is making the extendable belt with very cheap quality... although I'm a big fan of sound quality...these aren't making me to listen to it ü§¶ü§û
1,"I have purchased these headphones for my husband as a surprise. And it was so disheartening, that the product was such a failure. The headphones claimed to be noise isolation supportive, but everybody could listen to the song I am hearing. All I could feel was thump, and the headphones were vibrating as I maxed the volume. I paired my phone with these headphones,  but when I tried any other phone to be paired, it just gave me error messages ""Pairing rejected by Boat Rockerz 450""."
4,This headphone is good for the price but RockerZ 510 is far better than RockerZ 450.The 510 is extra bass boosted while this headphone feels like any other normal headphone .I've used both 510 and 450 so if you wanna buy one then I would suggest you the Boat Rockerz-510 .
2,"Hi guys, as expected both 450 and 400 are alike but slight high at 230hz and thump for 450 and remaining are same as 400If you wanna buy a new one of head set for bass lovers go for it if you are already boat customer of 400 no need to upgradeI also have boat 600 but it lasted for only 1yr approx due to non sweat proof and cushion  has damaged but  head set speakers are fineüòç for 450Pros1) bass2) good clarity3) comfortbut after a hour you feel discomfort but later it will be adjusting for feew weeks 450 rockerz, which i not found on boat 600( AS THEY ARE COMFORTABLE), but very much irritating on 400 rockerz4)  Battery lasted for more than 8 hrs as I used high volume5 ) value for money6) indication for max volume and connection, blue light for idle position, red even for charge and battery l7) quiet strong no room for breakage I hope they had build stronger than 4008) mention of battery in Bluetooth section how much percentage left9) connectivity is good as my home is 3 bedroom it came through two walls and outerdoor more than 15mts untill I go to down floor (400 had disconnected in 10-12 MTS )10) you can connect to two devices once only ( i have connected to iPad and mobile at once ) plays them alternative this is good featureCon's1) As it was not fully over ear2 ) it won't allow you to turn your face as it occupy whole neck (you should expand to max length )3 ) pads are cushion but the gap btwn both speakers are less so some discomfort (boat designers should realise that little bit of space is needed to design as they beat everyone )4) that's itThese heavy than boat 400 in weight and thump little bit in scale of 15/15 for 45014/15 for 400I have used 400 and 600 earlier as I suggest go for it for bass and mid lovers and budget 1500rsButtons are given as it gave on 400They are strudy enough , my previouss I got for almost 4 yrs boat 400 , and 600 last couple of years as am the first customer who bought thatt in 2015 as no one know boat at that time I have recommend for more than 50 peopleNow I have changed my opinion they broke of after 4 months I hope they are not that worthy if they broke out like this in betweenI have attached pictures so that you can handle it carefully already bought customers, or else better go for strong one rather that it's"
5,"First of all i am writing this review after intense usage during lockdown. If you want to buy it, go for it without any hesitation over jbl and mi super bass. As usual amazon's delivery was super fast.The build quality is extremely good but the headphone are made up of plastic. Quality is better than mi super bass headphones and these are very comfortable even when worn for extended periods. Bass quality is pretty good and it also has an in-built mic which cancel much of the background noise. It also has a 3.5mm audio jack so you can use it wired( without any battery usage) or wireless( on battery). The charge lasts around 8-9 hours if used for non-stop gaming like playing PUBG Mobile and COD Mobile. It has a standby tume of more than 100 hours ( yes that is true i have checked it myself) and it delivers lag free voice when playing games and it has a warranty of 1 year which can be claimed on the official website after registering the product. Note- the warranty doesn't cover any physical damage after the product has been handed on to the customer but boat's customer service is very agile.Please mark the review as helpful."
5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day‚Äôs sale, which further reduced the price by ‚Çπ500 to ‚Çπ1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.SOUND: It‚Äôs been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ‚Çπ2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.BATTERY LIFE: Since it‚Äôs only 3 days I can‚Äôt surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I‚Äôm using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that‚Äôs not an issue for me personally.I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you‚Äôll fall in love with your purchase and this product.UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I‚Äôm super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you‚Äôll never regret. ü§ô"
1,"The Build quality is very poor, Never purchase this product. It broke in a month even tho I was using my new headphone very carefully. It broke because the plastic used at that point is very weak and cheap.It look like they have used metal in the head band but that they have just pasted after the rotation point and it serves no Purpose.I am soo much trapped after purchasing this as they will not give service because it is considered as physical damage nor I can use it anymore. A complete waste of money."
5,BoAt gives us a good quality sound than sony headphones
5,lokking nice and desing is very good but during lockdown not able to getting product MRP
1,Had a good review but nowUpdate : after 1month useThe headphones has showed big cracks on both the side .Extremely disappointed ‚òπÔ∏èThe build quality isDon't think it is covered by warrantyWorst design at the extentable part.
4,"These over-ear headphones sound great with thumping bass and clear vocals along with good noise cancellation and bluetooth connectivity. It also has a really good build quality with eye catching looks and texture. The mic quality is also excellent and good for video conferencing calls or recording music/karaoke. However what the makers at boat forgot to focus on, is the ergonomics! I couldn't wear these headphones even for 5 mins as the pressure of the ear cups was too much, causing pain at the ear and neck region. Hence I returned these headphones. Hope boAt concentrates more on the ergonomics next time before launching any product!"
1,"-at this price range sound is well maintained even at high peak.-bass is not soo high or not having much thump in it, pritty low in bass.-noise isolation is just in paper.-padding is well given.- its way bulky.-build quality is decent.-other side cannot here my sound.its defective"
5,"Got this on the prime day exclusive sale. For Rs. 1498 u cant get a better deal than this.First i will come to the build. The entire thing is well cushioned. It is comfortable on the ears. No pressure on the ears like u just have to put it off even if u don't want to. The ears will sweat a little it's true but that is because they cover the entire year. The headband does not feel heavy at all on the head. There is no problems with the connectivity at all. It only took a few seconds to connect to my iPad air 3 and my realme 5 pro (mentioned the model so that angone having these model can buy it worryfree)Second the sound. The treble is a bit low but the base is on point. It comes both with a 3.5mm aux. So playing Pubg with this is no issue. With Bluetooth connectivity u will find latency but with the wire, footsteps and everything are clear af. There is noise cancellation but don't expect like those of bose. Obvio the price point does vary a lot. But for this range this is too good. I am satisfied with my purchase to the highest point. Just get it!!!"

4,"I bought this headphone on prime day sale for 1500/- . For this price range these are really good. I will divide this review between pros and cons.Pros:1. Unboxing experience was good it has every basic thing  aux wire and cable for charging.2 . Build quality: This is the best feature of these headphone. The pads are quite comfy . It was little on heavier side but distribution of weight is good,  it does not feel heavy on use. The buttons are made of plastic but they felt tactile. Overall it looks sturdy3 . Great design , as portrayed in the picture. The patterned pads gives premium feel.4 . Sound quality : The most important part of any audio product. I am no audiophile but i have tried several budget products and some high end products ober years so this might be helpfulThe balance of sound is good , the songs appear pleasing with a accentuated lows . It will do wonders if you like heavy bass.The mids aren't that great and sometimes they felt crushed by the overpowering bass. Instrument seperation is good and one can make out different instrument playing in the background but again they are little overpowered by bass. I know this is asking too much but boat should give a manual controller to decrease the bass like skullcandy crusher. Highs are above avg and the experience was quite enjoyable when when we were listening songs. When I was watching movies I could make out the dialogues spoken by the characters and the movie watching experience was quite enjoyable too . Overall it's a great sound experience for the price .5. Battery : No complaints here ! Great battery life . I don't know the actual backup but it lasted a week after charging it fully.6. it connected to my phone pretty easily  and the there was no drop in connection even if I move a little  away from the phone.Cons1. The bass is  little overpowering for my liking. If you can tweak using equilizer then you can find the perfect balance between all three mids highs and lows.2. It has micro-usb in 2020 which is little outdated.3. The buttons could have been a little better and while turning on the headphones there is a voice which says turned on sound is little loud even when you decrease volume.Hope you find it helpful!"
1,don't buy boat products. Boat is buying a low quality china products and branding as boat in India.I given this 1 star to write a review. It doesn't worth even 1star. It is dumbest brand I have ever used. Even a 100 rs street will give more life than boat.Got broken in right side without any usage. Previously I was using boat 255 and literally I have replaced 6 headset in 1year with one side not working issue. now boat 550 has a very low quality plastic body that will break if you open the headset to place on your ears.
5,Very comfy i hae 1 piece
3,"Contents in the box: User manual, warranty card (1 year), aux cable, headphones.Headphones come with 50 mm drivers, bluetooth 5.0,  AUX cable support.The headphones are very heavy (250 gms). A good amount of padding is done which makes it comfortable to wear, but it puts a lot of weight on your head and neck so can't wear it for long period of time.The build quality is poor. After using for some time the head band starts creaking and making noise which is annoying.The sound quality is very good. Sound is loud and clear. Everything sounds bass boosted, and sometimes feels unnatural.The battery backup is better than expected. Lasts for days with moderate usage. Charges to full in an hour. Lasts long.Latency is same as an average wireless headphones. You will experience lag in latency dependent tasks such as gaming and video calls.Once connected the range is good but facing difficulties in connecting to phone and laptop.Noise cancellation felt okay at first but with regular use it has decreased.AUX cable is bad quality and loose fitting although long enough.Pros:Loud and clear audioGood amount of bassGreat battery lifeAUX supportGood amount of paddingCons:Poor build qualitySometimes bass feels unnatural (too much)Very heavyNot foldable/portableConnectivity is not good."
1,The headphone stopped working after 15 days.power on failure.
2,My earphone has many scratches probably it is a used product.Sound 8/10Bass 7/10Treble 9/10Quality 8/10Clarity 7/10overall you will not get a satisfying experience from this headphones.
1,"Review after using this for  2 weeks :->1. Sound Quality : trash... My (Rs. 650) skull candy anti sounds way much much better than this thing.Lows are dead in this headphone, you will never be able to hear the little details, creativity in the songs.Bass is flat or no base at all , you will feel base only if you play bass boosted audio tracks, beats are very very low , even some beats are feeled bcos of headphone covers the whole ears else there is nothing that these headphone can do .In one word : sound quality of this headphone is just little bit higher than china's 150Rs. Earphones with some negligible better bass.2. Weight : this is really really heavy . I have used a lot of headphones but this is the only one which I was unable to wear for more than 1 hour , my neck hurts.3.At 30% Charge : it starts notifying battery low voice ""oops battery low"" sentence after every minute, which is really annoying if you watching movies, online class lecture, listening song.This is so annoying and makes it unable to use below 30%.4. Charger cable is approx 15cm long, which is useless .Please dont buy this product . Waste of money."
4,Very bad product build
1,No battery back up at all. Everytime I take this to use it never has enough battery to switch on. I have to charge this every single day even if I had used it for only 10 minutes and had charged for hours the day before. Completely disappointed with this product. Simply a waste of money.Also sometimes there is connectivity issue as there is some interference and the sound is not clear.
5,"So I've been using them for 2 days now, the sound quality is amazing (both bt and aux), noise isolation does work, for me it lasted 18 hours at 60% volume, it actually only takes 2 hours for a full charge (5v 2A adapter), for those who are wondering about the audio latency, there's no delay on most apps, for some games you might find a 1 second delay, but then again you can use the aux cable and it works fine. When you connect the aux cable you'll notice how it only detects the headphones and not the mic on the headphones, but don't worry i tested it and the mic works fine (both bt and aux). It's a great product for the price, considering the fact that it just released i do recommended you to buy these, just note that though it now says 1999 you can get them for 1500 whenever there's a sale."
1,Got a damaged product. Unable to insert the charge cable inside the charging slot...Did not expect this from Amazon. Returning this within 15 minutes of receiving the product in my hands....
1,"The decision to buy Boat headphones was a disaster. I replaced the headphones within a month of ordering since the right lobe had an issue and it got detatched. After receiving a replacement of the damaged product, I faced the exact same issue. The right lobe got detatched again that too within a month even after gentle usage. Since the product quality is pathetic and the product has an year's warranty, I either want a replacement or refund."
5,"Bought the RED version model. Design is lit as Hell.Sound quality is lit with Bass, little bit of mid and also treble.A bit heavy in weight.No lags in connectivity.Comfortable to wear, as ear cuffs are soft.After long hours of use, heats up the ear but it doesn't matter if you are in the air conditioning.Worth every Penny. No regrets.My OnePlus Dolby Atmos feature enhances the experience."
1,its plastic is of low quality it degradeg with time and broke i used it for 8 months then its plastic started breaking from different areas.PLEASE DONT BUY IT WONT LAST AND 2000 IS BIG AMOUNT FOR SUCH BAD QUALITY PLASTIC.
5,One problem with this because I thought of that first time I am using on ear earphones (üéß) I fill it is slipping and irritated for few minutes and when I listened to the music üé∂ beats and bass is super.phone calls and stream purpose it is good for sound and comfortablity is less due it is heavy compression and slipping down due to weight.So overall it is good to use for less time and not comfortable for longtime users.
1,"I ordered this product as i have been using Boat 10W Bluetooth Speaker since last 2 yrs which is very good in Bluetooth connectivity and sound quality that is why i ordered this boat headphone but when i started using it i found some Bluetooth connectivity issue like when am playing anything the sound and voice getting break, even in 2 meter distance"
1,Great sound quality but I get a defected peice and after 2 to 3 hours left earphone cannot give a little base bt only sound came from it
5,"Got the headphones on its release date for a price of 1350rs and it is definitely VFM at that price!!Pros :- Very comfortable and soft cushioning albeit a little heavy- Clean treble and good bass(bass lovers won't like this headphones as it's not bass boosted)- very good bluetooth range- great battery life- VFM- mic quality is surprisingly decent- noise isolation is good but not greatCons :- the stitching on the foam feels a bit gentle, and the headphones creaks when flexed... so not sure about the long term reliability- 50mm drivers is a gimmick! I used Sony xb450ap before and it's 30mm drivers were better in every way. But it's also 2x pricey and is wired.. so, you get what you pay but don't get fooled by the marketing...- Not a con, but this headphones is not for bass lovers. Bass is good but not prominent/boosted."
2,"I bought it as a cheap replacement for my Steel Series, and strictly for official teams/skype calls.What I wanted - A Bluetooth headset with Aux compatibility with a good mic. Comfort wasn't in my Wishlist as this was completely for occasional calls.The headset volume was ok, both over bluetooth and aux. Very tight on the head that, you feel an instant ""Uncomfortable noise cancellation"".Tested the mic on the phones, and my voice was nearly audible. Tested it on my laptop, and the other side couldnt even hear my voice. The voice tests shows a max of 32% even when I shouted,Moral: Dont go by reviews by kids who just need volume and bass.And Amazon has no direct return policy, So a replacement is being sent. Waste of time"
5,I will not take much time..... directly comming to the point....* Sound quality beyond expectations...it really has good highs mids and lows.... Treble is a bit high but its fine ...sound is crystal clear...and immersive...* It comes physical noice isolation wich works fine.... dramatically increases sound depth...* Battery life is pretty much same as mentioned.* Bass is pefrect for all purposes...not only for gameing....not only for music....its very balanced and satisfactory ......* it could feel a bit heavy for small heads.... otherwise comfort level is 9/10 and wich is far better in this price segment.....one can easily use it for hours...* No connecting issue in my device.....yes a bit delay in gaming....but with aux...it works absolutely fine.....* Both the colour variations are pretty cool....but i orderd black and grey variant...bcz i feel this is more classy... Red one is also attractive...but its too bright...will look cheap on some dresse....you have to dress according to it....and after some frequent uses .....colour will get dull.So i prefered black version...but its ypur choice.* Over all the device is master piece of art by boat.....so pocket friendly...and beating easily so mamy other branded premium headphones....you can go for it for sure.....you will not gonna regret buying it ...trust me..
1,"What i got was a second hand piece.The box was already opened when i got it.When i used it, surprisingly the bluetooth cuts off when i put my phone in my pocket ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è . What i got was already returned by someone else. Sound quality was also awful.I think it is replica. üò§Don‚Äôt go with. üôÇI returned the headphones and i got the refund. üôÇüòå"
5,"Over the ear headphones we generally see in premium category This is purely budget oriented. Seriously awesome 1st of all very comfortable over the ears but if yu use it for more than an hour you will get sweat on the ears and 2nd thing is decent sound quality decent base . 3rd is battery life and two way connectivity. Definitely at the price of Rs1499(prime day deal) simply awesome. Build quality is plastic we can't expect more at the price of Rs1499. Definitely try the product you won't feel disappointed. If you wanted to try over the ear headphones üéß for the 1st time in your life use this headphones so that you will get habituated the after few months go for premium brand over the ear headphones like BOSE , SONY , Senhizer etc."
1,Having blutooth connectivity issues sometimes. Mic also not working properly.
3,"Best ever crystal clarity i have ever heard from any over head headphones.üî•üî•üî•But most importantly don't buy these if you are true bass lover and need thumb in ear for every song.Built quality and comfort are best in this segment but i honestly feel they are bit overpriced for 2k boat should have launched at 1.5k.Even with 50mm driver bass is the most weakest point.But watching movies and YouTube, Netflix is üî•üî•üî•You will be able to listen small details in videos.If you don't want bass but clarity then don't give any other thoughts.I even had zebronics zeb duke and boult pro bass boost they are beast when it comes to bass output but they lack clarity by just 20%Lows and mids are clear than any other in this segment.Suggest you to buy these only at 1.5k for 2k they are dammn over priced.Battery life is tooo good for 28hr+ than claim.You can also twist and rest on chest when not needed.Sound leakage at 90 level it's 10% but really you will listen these all around 70% volume.Me personally ‚ò∫Ô∏è was able to use them for 3hr+ continuous.Even one big advantage that non other offers under 2k is comfort 10/10,After wearing for longer session other headphones makes some inner pain feel like vacuumed ear or pressured but these problems were not at all present.And one big importantly BOAT has great After sales service than any other india lifestyle brand no worries as they provide free pickup and drop service at your home.It's all indian brand but MADE IN CHINA.But all headphones india are made in china up under 2kBoult Boost and zeb Duke are great alternative for this if you don't get 550."
5,"Here's everything you need to know.Pros:* Perfect fit* Not heavy* Decent bass* Beautiful design* Quite comfortable* Awsome battery life* No noticeable latency* Very capable to get loud* Crystal clear sound quality* Ear cups fully cover the ears* Easy to launch Google Assistant* Great connectivity (Bluetooth 5.0)* You won't hear anybody while playing music* Blocks about 80% of surrounding sound when not playing musicCons:* Would've been very convenient if it had a USB-C port for charging* Mic quality is average but I don't expect any better from headphones which aren't gaming headsets* Coming from Zakk H04 Blaze which are on-ear headphones, the bass is a little less compared to on-ear headphones* Fancy LED lights like H04 Blaze would've made it look better in dark but that has nothing to do with the headphones itselfConclusion:Bought it in a sale for 1500 INR. Good value for money and is worth buying even for the regular price of 2000 INR. Go for the red color, you'll truly admire it, the black one is quite dull. The sound quality is amazingly nice and these headphones are very capable of producing good bass. If you really like a lot of bass, use an equalizer and you'll be pleased with it. These are not active noise canceling headphones and I know that, but the passive noise cancellation is suprisingly good. Excellent purchase, no regrets."
1,"Price : 1499, Ordered during Diwali sale.Received on 11.11.20201. I received a damaged package, also the right ear cup of the headphones had several dents.2. At the very next day, it started to struggle in bluetooth connectivity.3. I placed a replacement, AMAZON was too nice and they have arranged an immediate replacement.4. But the Seller was too bad, they have sent me a package with broken seal and it was clearly an used product.(Replacement package)This made me to hate 'Appario' to the core.About headphonesPros:1. Great comfort2. Amazing battery backup3. Physical noise cancellation, not bad4. Can be connected with two devices5. Decent bassCons:1. (Bluetooth) Every time you need to reconnect it twice, after conncetion it will struggle to play audio for 10 seconds later it will be good, IDK why.2. While playing games like PUBG, it definitely need to be used in Aux mode. There is a minimum delay in audio while connected through bluetooth."
1,"Music sound is nice. But the microphone does not work at all. I lost a very important deal because of the same. No matter how hard you scream to get your point across, the person on the other side can hardly hear you !!!!!! It would be better , if BOAT just directly told the users that microphone is not available, in which case i wouldnt have bought the product. If zero stars were available, this product deserves it.4 months moderate use - check the pic, it's broken !!! Best SC"
1,Boat used to make great products don't know what happened to them. The audio quality was really bad compared to the iconic rockers 400 and quality of headphones itself has degraded the charging port came off on the first charge itself. Sad to see their whole range of products diminish in quality.
1,"Got boAt rockerz 400 the first time ,with exchange i got a refurbished product, full of dust in the box.The headphones are really bulky..No noise cancellation but noise isolation.The earcups covers your ears so the outside noise doesn't come in.20 hours backup.. superb.Bass just okaysound at max volume is unbearable coz of sound isolation, can damage eardrums coz of loudness."
5,"Oh this is really good. Some might find the bass to be a bit low. For me it was adequate although sometimes i prefer to use an equalizer. If you want to get deep bass all the time, use an equalizer. Even if you dont use equalizer it will still deliver thumping bass. It delivers distortion free sound at high volume. Sound quality was pretty good. Sound isolation is ok. If its raining heavily you wont hear the rain at all.  The best part is i got it with 500/- discount.The bluetooth range is good. There is no distortion of bass. However when it came to call quality it was like 50-50. Could be due to my phone as it is pretty outdated (will check the call quality using other devices). Mostly i used this for watching movies or listening to music, so call quality doesnt matter that much. Watching a movie with the headphone was a superb experience. You will get that theater kind of vibe.  Ear cups and padding on the headphone is excellent. The quality of material used is premium and top notch. Overall my experience has been very good (probably the best affordable headphone i have used so far)"
3,"This is an over-ear headphone and as for all budget over ear headphones, the primary priority is comfort. But this headphone is miserable on that front. The ear cups are well padded and accomodate my ears perfectly. But the clamping force is too much. There is also something about the design that exerts more pressure on the lower base of my ears. I had watched a few reviews on YouTube, where they also mentioned this problem. So, I kept the headphones for stretching using a cardboard box and 3 books. This could reduce the clamping force over a few days. Also, it can grow comfortable over time. Personally, I find Sennheiser HD 206 to be more comfortable at this price range (having used it before), New Republic Starboy is also a good option for comfort, according to reviews.Update- I got a replacement but this one was comfortable (not much clamping force). But unfortunately, there's a issue while connecting the aux cable. The left ear cup become louder. Returning due to this. But overall, it's a really good earphone."
4,I bought it and it was not working after 17days. Since it was not under return policy of Amazon. The customer service helped with warranty and it was able to get a new item from nearest Logitech center. Voice quality is nice but the it decreases after some use.
5,"I know reviews are personal opinion, but it did surprise me when couple of people give bad reviews - cause its an awesome headset for the price you are paying.I got a Sennheiser PC 8 (http://www.amazon.in/Sennheiser-PC-Over-Ear-USB-Headphone/dp/B005HWEZGG/ref=pd_rhf_cr_s_qp_1_FXWK?ie=UTF8&refRID=0C1EE3FG0Q2GVK79KCH2)And in my opinion it was such a piece of crap in comparison to Logitech H340 Headset.The only problem or the headset's awesomeness - however you want to see it is that it's mic picks up every minute noise, including my friend's mouse clicks who is sitting considerable far from where I am.I highly recommend you guys go for it.To make the mic perform better what I did is wrap a piece of foam around the mic so that it doesn't create the swoosh sounds when you say something that ends with 's' (see the image attached).Over all awesome product - loved it.And Amazon's delivery has been on time and as usual delivered a great product."
4,"This product is amazing as it is comfortable and easy to use if you are working for long hours.  I have been using this headset for the past two months but to be honest this was a re-order and the previous one I had used for approx two years (had to replace because the headset cover got torn - the only minus). The audio quality is excellent and noise cancellation even though there, you can hear the surrounding environment if it is not a quiet one. The mic quality is also superb. The price is a bit on the high side but it's worth it if you look at its durability and I got it on time without delay and at a discounted price too thanks to Amazon Prime!!"
5,I bought this headset for my 7 year old son to wear it during online classes. It's perfect for small kids as it's lightweight and sits gently on his tender ears which makes it possible to wear for longer time. Though it's expensive but serves the purpose. I have also tested it for sound quality and it's very clear. I would highly recommend it.
3,After testing may bluetooth headphone i have ordered Logitech H340 headphone. Its very nice quality of product with sound and mic. ITS NOICE CANCEL ACTIVE headphone that good about this product.But there is two minus point about headphone- it does not have control over mic ( on / off  or volumn + / - )  inself.- its headphone grip over head can not be locked so it lose its grip while we move around.Overall its good product
1,"After paying a premium price, performance of this product is like 100 rs othe earphone..even far below..noise cancellation works in such a way..that it cancel my voice and otherwise person keep complaning ..please speak louder....after shouting..I got complains from otherwise..headphone antena..or voice handler..such a small..even voice does not reach to it..i feel bad after pusrchasing it and put it in junk"
1,"Product worked only for a day on freshly installed windows 10. As soon as there were some patch upgrades, it stopped working. Looks like it is not compatible with windows 10. I checked in 3 win 10 laptops but no luck.Product website and Microsoft forums also mention that this device does not work after Windows 10 upgrade. These compatibility related information must be put on the product description page else gradually customer will lose faith from Amazon's marketplace. Whether you accept this review or not its your choice, but let me assure you that this was the last electronic product I bought from Amazon."
5,Worth the price. Got it for 2k and outside it is 2.5 sow orth the money. I've dropped this for over a million times and yet lasted me for two solid years with high quality. This is my first purchase through amazon for this headset and they delivered right when I wanted it. Love it
5,"I've had fantastic luck with this headset so far. I've had this set for over a year now and I use it almost every day to teach over the internet. I have tried using it for more demanding voice recording and there is quite a bit of noise recorded as well so you might want to pick a higher-end model if you are pod casting or something of that nature, but it is perfect for chatting online or listening to music/movies/etc."
2,i had seinheiser headset USB for skype calls and for backup purpose bought this headset.  But sound is coming only one side from this side which is disappointment.  on the other hand sound is coming from both the sides on the sienheiser headset.  This headset looks good but not meeting the functionality and no controls on the headset to put mute and sound adjustments.  The sienheiser has that and also cost less than this headset.
5,"I have been using it almost 8 hours on all working days for last 8 months ! I am into training and consulting profession, so mike quality and noise cancellation is important.  The product is of great use and surely I recommend this to people who has to deliver training or conduct online reviews. Wire length is sufficient, so that I can stand and move little back while training so that I appear in video. Easy to use, just connect USB. Comfortable and no problem even though I wear for long hours.  Looks professional. As of now, I did not find any problems  it is working great for me."
5,"As the headphones don't have buttons to control volume like Plantronics, it don't support volume control. When coming to noise cancellation it no where differs with Office headphones (which costs 8k). Build quality is not much good, after few months of usage, the USB port which is plastic covered is fragile and may not lost longer. The head band is some what loose and the wire inside the band that is given for adherence is coming out of the band leading to band becoming very loose. Except build quality I rate 4/5"
1,Not a worthy product considering the price they are charging it will stop working in 2nd month of use.Me and my friend bought it and both of us are facing the same issue. It doesn‚Äôt work at all after 2-3 months. There is some serious issue with this product. I wonder is this covered under any warranty i want replacement?Freaking spent 2600 bucks on this. Totally disappointed.
4,"Absolutely no doubt about its sound quality. It does what it needs to do in terms of sound. But it does fit on your head and it keeps slipping, also a mute button is what min required from Logitech. Better to go for higher version if you can afford"
1,"This type of build is not expected from Logitech, this feel like a cheap product. headsetUSB connector is very weak and loose, wire of the headset is very thin and poor quality at this price.Noise cancellation works okay."
5,"Superior quality, durability. I have been using it for more than 4 years now. Fallen in love with it due to the build quality, design and usability. It lacks a  volume/mute control on the wire but I had troubles with other headset with those from various brand including logitech. I dont know if this model is available now in the market but I really recommend  this. Like it very much.!!"
3,"I bought it few months back and I think post 6 months of its usage, one day suddenly it‚Äôs mic had stopped working. I had tried many permutation and combination but it never worked. My usage was taking office call(teams, skype). I won‚Äôt recommend this product to buy."
1,The headset stopped working within a month. I thought it was only me but all my colleagues who bought this gave the same review. Don't go for it at all. Cheap quality product.
2,The sound quality etc are ok. But it has a massive problem with the mic noise continuously leaking into the earphones. I can constantly hear myself breathing through the earphones and it is immensely irritating and hurts the ears too.  I have to take this thing off the moment a meeting is over.
4,Delivery is super fast and product is good...noise cancellation is also okay.I am satisfied.
1,"This headphone is complete waste of money. Within weeks wire will come out of band. Mic stopped working after few month of use.I purchased for mainly receiving webex, skype meeting. Simply waste of money."
1,"Post I purchased the product it was working all fine for a month and after a month it completely stopped working. Initially, it was impressive and from day one the built quality for not so great. The plastic was of cheap quality and the ear cushioning was also of basic type."
5,I ordered the headset on saturday (ZINGA PUNGA) and was surprised to get it delivered by monday itself. Thanks to amazon as it Packed beautifully inside a logitech branded boxing.Easy to unpack and installs rightaway when plugged into an USB port in your desktop/laptop.Checked the functioning with skype and its brilliant without any issues.Audio is crisp with clear mids and highs but somewhat muffy low.Microphone is brilliant and could record even minute surrounding voices.
3,It's a good product. I am using since last 5 yrs. That's why ordered the exact same piece again. Awesome voice quality but lack of strength in the product. Logitech should pay some attention on the build quality of this product.
5,Good for the price. Satisfactory noice cancellation. I can hear the other person loud and clear. Mic works really well too. Build quality is on the cheaper side though and One needs to be very careful in handling the headset in order to prevent any damage.
5,"1. Better mic compare to H1512. Earphone sound quality is not as good as H1513. To be connected through USBFor online teaching and meetings this is a better option than H151, because of the better quality of mic."
1,"By seeing the specs, I felt that inside area of ear cups is complete cushion. But actually the product comes with two small paper like pieces of sponge which comes for a road side product.  I really don't understand what it means shown in the pic attached."
4,Purchased only because of noise cancellation mic to take office calls at home. Serving my purpose decently and the audience was able to notice the difference.
5,Purchased it keeping in mind the volume of calls I had to take at work. I needed something which ideally serves the purpose and not necessarily just a headphone. I use a MacBook hence it's USB enabled connection was seamless. Just plug and play
3,"Even though it's Pricey the Quality of sound is good. Does not have volume control.  The cushion are thin, could have been more thicker for a good cushion."
5,"First, I was mainly purchasing these headphones for the wireless and battery features. What I received was a great quality sound, and greater battery life than stated.Pros:- Battery Life - This was one of the biggest reasons for purchasing these headphones. I was looking for a set of headphones that would last longer than 4-6 hours and stumbled across these. I run the headphones for ~6-7hrs a day for four days. On the fifth day, I run the headphones until they turn off on their own. This normally happens around noon. This gives me a battery life of about 28-32 hours, beyond the stated 25 hours.- Great Design ‚Äì I fell in love with headphone, from the time I set my eyes on it. It is stunning looking and great design.- Sound Quality - The old headphones I was replacing with these were kind of tinny in sound quality. These headphones have really rich deep bass. I was extremely pleased with the sound.Overall, it checks all boxes for a stunning Headphone at a very affordable price. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
1,The product quality seemed to be Better in the intial usage but began to cause crackling noise.Has a cushion and beautiful design but functionally it's not good upto it's pricing.Note: Boltt also promises to give you a free movie ticket and gaana subscription if you upload screenshot of it's review on Amazon but cheats you once you have upadted the review.It does not give you the codes.
4,"This is a first impression for the Fire-Boltt Blast 1400 Over-Ear Bluetooth Wireless Headphones. Before you read further you should know that when you buy the headphone, you will get a warranty subscription along with a 3 month Gaana HD+ subscription and a free movie voucher for Bookmyshow. The only way you can register for warranty is once you have left a review here on amazon. Having said that, this impression is completely non-biased.Build Quality - The headphones are huge. I have a pumpkin sized head and I was pleasantly surprised that they turned out to be bigger than I thought. Build quality is superb for a headphone in this price range. The vertical and sideways swivel mechanism is smooth and sturdy making it quite portable and able to fit any head shape. The arching hinge is made of thin aluminium making it light, flexible but sturdy. The ear cushions are quite soft and don't irritate my ears at all. BUY A HARD CASE, so it always stays protected when you travel with it.Sound Quality - (I have tested the quality based on usage with my MacBook Air and One Plus 7T) The passive noise cancellation seems to work well. The ear cups work well in preventing sound leaking out and seeping in. Bass is decent. It is clear but there is no thump to it even when you max out your volume. The Lows could be clearer. The mids and highs are definitely crystal clear. I have tested it both through the audio jack and Bluetooth on both devices and the quality through the audio jack sounds better (no surprise there). Overall I'd say sound quality is quite good, not excellent nor great compared to other headphones in this price range. But the overall package added with the passive noise cancellation is great I'd say.If you can wait for the price to drop below 3000, then this pair of Headphones is an absolute no brainer of a buy. Considering that it is portable, wired/wireless and has passive noise cancellation, I'd say it will suit the needs of a budding audiophile cum music producer as well. NOTE - I don't know why the website says Google/Siri assistant built-in. It doesn't have that unless I am an idiot and cannot find it."
5,"pros- this headphone have great battery life- sound quality is also good- best headphone to buy in this price range just by first look- good customer service- After using for 2 months both ear-cubs came out of housing, and it was without single drop, but i got replacement from customer service.cons- it is beeping very frequently even if it have 30% battery remaining, it may be fixed by company after referring this issue in future, so it's not severe issue"
1,"I was impressed by the reviews on Amazon and ordered this product. Let me tell both the positive as well as negative reviews.Positive:I was impressed with the bass and sound quality and the quality of the product. Overall good.Negative:But after getting the product and using for a whole day, I got to know that there's a connectivity problem with the AUX cable from which I was able to hear only one side of the headphone, and also my callers were not able to hear me properly when I connected through Bluetooth on mobile. So I returned and got a replacement. But unfortunately, I faced the same issues and returning it again.It is up to you if you want to try the product and share your reviews."
5,"Review for Boltt Blast140I have used Sony,JBL,Sennheiser headphones beforePros:1.Ear-cups are comfortable and wearing for a long time does not hurt.2.Frequency response spectrum is quite good and the bass is also pretty good.3.The included cable for charging is long4.The Wireless connectivity is good5.In the wired format they have included a 2.5 jack to studio jack connector but the product also works with a dual sided 3.5 mm jack as well as dual sided 2.5 mm jack so yay for that.6.There is a thicker than usual layer of padding even beneath the ear cups which is a huge plus.7.Build Quality is really on par with the top contenders.8.They don't feel heavy for some reason even though they are said to be 390 grams probably due to the amazing padding on the head rest.Cons:1.Ears get a warm after 3 to 4 hours of use.(But do note that the conditions outside were also quite hot)2.For the same sound Intensity :Wireless mode ->100% volume ,while in Wired mode->60% Volume .3.Build Quality is good but the polishing work could have been better.So all in all the product is Built Well,Has a good Bass ,Frequency spectrum response is good(Balanced noise),Noice cancellation is also GOOD and it looks clean.Its Cheap at price at around Rupees.2800  but is on par with more expensive Headphones such as JBL55BT,JBL650BT etc."
4,Good
3,"Every thing is fine with the device in terms of blue tooth connectivity, sound quality, durability quality etc...I bought this headphones for recording audio. When you speak, each of your word is shadowed with notice or dissonance in the back ground. Sine my main purpose is not served i gave average reading of 3. Not only this headphone, but  the other headphones available in the market like mi, boat are also having the same issue."
1,"Initial reviewThe sound quality not seems to be excellent but under this price range this is awsome. Writing this review immediately after it have been delivered so not sure about the backup, Build quality is good , I have tried JBL headset that is  more costlier than this one  but the BOLT build quality is superior than other model with in same price rangeAfter one week :The charge indicator goes off after half an hour, I am doubtful that the headset is  charging even if its connected bcz the charge indicator goes off and I am not getting 25H of playtime mentioned it in the product descriptionAfter One yearOne of the headphone speaker not working now and outer leather wrapping start to peel off from 6 th month onwards"
4,"my point of view - i was mainly looking for a decent looking, solidly built, collapsible, with Mic, Good battery life, Over the Ear BT headphones at a bit reasonable price point of 3k-4k upto 6k around budget.Initially i only wanted to buy much popular brands like Sony, JBL, and other known brands.I found no headphones that was satisfying all my needs, a few are available but their mixed reviews stopped me from buying them.About Boltt Blast 140- So obviously this has all Those feature i mentioned above, and at this price point this is a good deal, sound quality is decent, the bass is okay, to make calls is smooth, battery(450mAh) life seems promising but this is something that will take some months to come to an opinion, becuase batteries show their true color after an year or so.  The pack comes with an aux cable and charging cable along with 2 perks(free coupons) to use and a Warranty instruction card.So far so good, will add to review in future.Update : this lasted for 1 year, after that it's one plastic hook that was broken and there was nothing I can do about.... It hanging now... But still working.  But can't fix that plastic part it is ruptured when broke. I am not sure if my daughter dropped it or how it got broken... So not commenting on it... But yes it has that kind of delicate mechanism there which may break if handled without care....."

5,"Premium wireless Over ear Headphones1) Battery life more than expected.2)Build quality is top notch with stunning look.3)Soft cushions, can be wore for long hours.4)Bass and treble are enhanced with 32 ohms of impedance which can be easily drive by any smartphone.5)Best for listening EDM's  This Headphones is awesome for the price range."
1,"Price too much hiked for the value it is giving. Expected very much, but its nothing! Fuski bum hai ye to.Cons:1. Not comfortable for more >=1 hour even in the most stretched mode!2. Bluetooth connectivity is as ordinary as a 100rs/- blue tooth stick which I bought long back.3. Buttons feel cheaper. Dont this it will last long.4. Microphone isn't very sensitive while talking on phone. My 380/- wired earphone is better in this area than this 3.5k headphone.5. Blue tooth pairing with 2 or more devices is not really feasible. For this price they should have included this bit of technology in this headphone.6. Sound quality is only as good as a 800/- headphone I bought lastly.Pros:1. Battery may really long last. It worked for appx 20 hours for me against their promise of 24 hours. Its still fine for me. But because of discomfort of wearing for long, dont know what use it will serve.2. Jamming with the guitar in your headphone is quite a cool option.3. We can use the 3.5 mm wires if the battery doesn't last long.4. Also you can avoid blue tooth near around your body by simply using the 3.5 mm jack given.5. If you like the Premium Gaana subscription, you might feel good for 3months free subscription it is giving in extra.Last word - They have simply hiked the price without really covering all the aspects of such a costly headphone.It is good buy only under 1500/-. Not a single rupee more than that!!I would have given a 5 Star rating for that price, but really disappointed with the company's pricing strategy! Only a money making company. Not a value giving Company! Sorry for bitter truth üôèüèº"
3,"Good over the ear headphones with inbuilt mic.Speaker quality is quite good.Mic is non reliable. At times people will be able to hear you, at other times you will need to shout to get your voice across.Biggest problem is battery low alert. It starts at 30 percent and alerts every 30 seconds. This renders the device practically unusable after the battery drops down to 30 percent or lower."
5,"The only complaint I have with it is the cable length. It is short for use on PC which is primary device. But for mobiles which will always be in hands or in the pockets, not a big deal. Bluetooth is amazing! loud sounds, clear, and each and every sound can be appreciated separately! Bass is good too. It is not overpowering as to dampen other sounds. Great buy! Waited like a month for these to come back in stock! The ear pads are SOFT and BIG so they completely cover my ears as much as they envelope them. :)  I used BOAT for 3 years (still am) before these and they  are still going strong! but the ear cusps are ON EAR not OVER EAR so this is a good change. watching YouTube streams, or listening to a variety of songs, playing games like BIOSHOCK, PUBG, DOTA, SEKIRO, CoD, DRAGON AGE, etc feels amazing on this one!"
1,"THIS IS THE MOST DISAPPOINTING HEADPHONES I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. IT IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS IF YOU RECEIVE CALLS WHILE USING ON BLUETOOTH. THE CALLER CANNOT HEAR YOUR VOICE AT ALL. WHEN I RECEIVED THE HEADPHONES, I ASSUMED IT MUST BE DEFECTIVE. I ASKED FOR REFUND BUT WAS SENT REPLACEMENT HEADPHONES. EVEN WITH THE REPLACEMENT, THE SAME PROBLEM CONTINUES. IF YOU RECEIVE A VOICE CALL, THE CALLER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HEAR YOU, WHILE YOU CAN HEAR THE CALLER. I CHECKED EVERYTHING IN BOTH THE HEADPHONES, EVEN SHOWED IT TO MY ELECTRONICS DEALER, BUT IT WAS OF NO USE. UNFORTUNATELY AMAZON DOES NOT HAVE REFUND POLICY FOR THIS PRODUCT. I HAVE WASTED MY MOENY & WILL NEVER BIY ANY ELECTRONICS ON AMAZON INDIA. AMAZON, IF YOU REALLY HAVE A CUSTOMER CARE SUPPORT, PLEASE GET ME A REFUND & REDEEM YOUR REPUTATION"
1,"Had purchased a Fire Boltt 1400 headphone that was delivered by Amazon on 23 Sept 2020. Within two months of use the Bluetooth button ceased functioning. This was reported to the seller, who guided me to the manufacturer. I contacted the manufacturer's customer service through E-mail. As advised by them I was asked to provide all the details along with copy of the bill, a short video of the defective product & some other details like pick up address for replacement. The defective product was picked up by the company's courier service & I was assured of replacement within approximately 15 days upon receipt of the defective headphone at their warehouse. According to the tracking record of the courier service, Delhivery, the headphone was returned at the company's warehouse on 28 Dec. 2020. I am sorry to state that I have not received replacement of the headphone till now. I have sent four reminders to the company and shockingly the company is neither responding nor acknowledging my mails in this regard. I feel cheated & robbed of Rs.3499/-, the amount paid to Amazon for this headphone.So please beware & be informed if you are planning to purchase a Boltt product."
1,"Hi,  All Amazon buyrs following Issues I found wuth some good features also.First Good Features.This after 6 month of usage I am submitting this review.1) Good Packaging2) Amazon Delivery is fine.Issues.1) Bluetooth always gives poor quality sound when we use with Phone call. Person on other end did not get clear voice from us.2) Battery time is not more then 15 Hrd.Conclusion: I will always regret that insted of buying Sony Headphones who has a strong service center support I choose this China made product. Any way its a waste of money. Do not go for it.HTH,NilkanthNavsari,Gujarat. INDIA"
5,"Hello,It is very good headphone. Its sound quality is very good and quality material used to made this headphone."
1,"Extremely Poor Mic quality, the person on other side feels like your voice is just too heavy and not clear at all.switching between PC and phone isn‚Äôt that great as well.It switches to PC quick but not as quick to the phone."
1,"The product is okayish, more or less like anything else in the 2500-3000 rupees price range, won't go into technical details, once you bought the product you're on your own, if it works it works, if some problem arises, the one year warranty is nothing more than a scam, that's the problem with these disguised drop shipping companies, they only know how to import stuff and rebrand them with their own, the service is trash, the slider from both sides got loose and it no longer stays on the ears, been posted many times about all the details required on their website and mailed them 15 times and they said they don't cover it in the warranty, although, there's no physical breakage at all, I asked them about how and where to get it fixed as the slider design is not common, it's so annoying that first they give response after 10 mails and when they do, it's worthless it's okay even if it is paid repair, but they never responded afterwards. Better go for the top brands or independent companies if service is important to you."
3,"Pros:- Nice looks- Comfortable over the head and ear because of cushioning- fits well, length can be adjusted. Fits nicely over the ears- Got quick replacement which is working good nowCons:- Pricey for given set of features- Bluetooth connectivity is limited range. My other over-the-ear headphone bought at 1/3 price provides long range and strong bluetooth connectivity than this- Only volume and start/stop controls on the headset. My low end headphone provides next song / prev song controls too, along with pause- Even though covers the ears, doesn't reduce noise much (not that they claim, but was my expectation)- For the given price of INR 3400, more functionality could have been provided"
1,"I bought this headset all hyped from the info, but my experience was very underwhelming. First, the microphone was not working at all. it was not able to capture my voice. I requested for replacement and that was done very quick so hats off to amazon's service. The replaced one had mic working but it isn't reliable at all.its been a month of using it so here are my pros and cons.Pros:1. decent sound quality on bluetooth, gets better with headphone jack2. kinda have microphone.3. comfortable on ears.Cons:1. battery takes many hours to charge and doesnt last as long.2. Sound on headphone jack is better than bluetooth.3. Upon turning bluetooth on, stereo doesnt connect automatically, requires me to open bluetooth settings, disconnect, reconnect again and cross my fingers."
5,By just browsing on the Boltt website for not more then 5 mins it was confirmed that I wanted to but the Boltt blast 1400. The Headphones fit comfortably over your Ears and not on your Ears which is a big plus point . You won't find any other Bluetooth headphone in this Range that fit Over ears. Connectivity of the headphones are rock solid did not have a Single drop in the connection no matter what. The treble and Bass is equally balanced . There is no Sound cancellation hardware in these headphones however the Ear Muffs on the Headphones seal the external sound Upto 50 %. The built Quality of the headphones is above Average or Close to Good but not GOOD and definitely not excellent. The Buttons are located in the right place easy to Operate. It has a 6.5 mm jack for audio sharing which is my favourite feature  I connect the headphones to my Old Home theatre via Aux and play music wirelessly. The price of the product is definitely a Steal deal. The package includes a micro Usb 2.0 cable for charging and a 6.5 mm to 3.5mm aux cable for audio sharing .The headphones do have a Dedicated 3.5mm jack to listen to music if your headphones run out of power but no 3.5mm to 3.5mm  audio cable included in the Box. The box also incly few coupons for free gaana.com for 3 month and coupons for movie tickets. Overall it the best Headphones on this price range .
4,"Pros:1. Very sturdy design2. Long battery life3. Good audio sound quality4. Can connect another headset using Aux cable , so that same audio can be listed by two people at a time5. Comforatable with long usage. Could use it comfortably for continuous calls for 2-3 hours.6. Combination of wired and wireless gives added flexibiliy.Cons:1. Struggled to connect Webex on Widnows 10 laptop. The bluetooth mike does not work properly.2. Multipoint functionality does not work the way I understood. As soon as I connect my mobile, I can't hear the ongoing audio on my laptop which was connected and playing earlier.3. Many people complain to me that they can't hear me clearly on the call. I have to use my hands so that the voice gets directed to the mike."
1,Pathetic product from Boltt. Bought this to use to take calls using Zoom & Teams but it‚Äôs not working. Peanut can‚Äôt hear you as well as every few seconds disconnects. No noise cancellation.Even if fan is running people  can only hear lots of noise.In nutshell I would not suggest anyone to buy this if you wanted to use for taking calls. Buy it only when you just want to listen music. Even u can see delay in sync while seeing YouTube videos.
5,"1)Build quality Excellent.2) Bluetooth connectivity seamless.3)Sound Quality, perfection to fall in love.4)comfort ,hmm 10 min of usage and my ears feel very uncomfortable,might be it needs to be aged a bit.Overall it's a good headset .Above are my first impressions ,and used just for 10 min."
3,"First off when you see the headphones, they look premium. The comfort of the ear pads is very good and it even fits big eared people like me (No pain on ears even after use for 4 hours plus).The bluetooth range offered is also adequate, I could get the range for upto 20 feet, it was surprising as usually the headphones I owned before all could not provide such range.After a week of usage, there have been some loose screws and they cannot be fitted back in place due to some manufacturing defect hence I cannot enjoy the music , I believe the return/replacement window should be atleast more than a week, you cannot judge the defects of a product within a week. Would have been glad if I could get a replacement."
4,Fire-Boltt Blast 1400Giving this review as Boltt company has made it mandatory to register the warranty online.Forcing customers to give review is so ridiculous.Actual review will be updated soon.
1,It is like a bull worker on your head can‚Äôt bear it for 3 minutes one full music no.  No great sound terrible mic.  the package.This is  old Tecnology junk that costs 3500/ my sons 1800 bucks head phones have fast charging every thing in it is better than this. I decided to return it with in 5 minutes of opening and called Amazon.  These guys say their policy is only replacement.  I tried to convince them for half an hour another 10 minutes with the hire up of Amazon just did not work.  Beware these guys deliver junk With in 24 hours.  Now I need space to store it.All I am asking is replacement with another brand Amazon refused to do it.  It is better to buy in a store to avoid this kind of Cheating.
1,The first headphone had lots of crackling and distortion so a replacement was requested. The replacement arrived promptly but seemed like some one elses replacement piece or a refurbished one  . All the inmer packing was open and box was externally taped. The distortion still exists so not only headphones are not upto the mark but seller also seems to be shady sending out a used piece as replacement for a faulty ouece.
5,"TL; DR: Soft AND large ear-cups; medium-lightweight; good build quality; above-average music experience. Read further for a detailed review.The main factor for me while looking for an over-ear headphone was that it actually has OVER ear ear-cups. And I should say that it definitely fulfils that job.Pros:1. The foam in the headband and ear-cups is very soft (for reference, as soft as a mushy banana) and has partial memory-foam, meaning it adjusts according to the contours of the ears.2. The earcups are huge, dimensions (length/breadth of the oval): 10cm*8cm (outer); 6cm*4.5cm (inner).  2.1. They fully cover the ears, and one can keep wearing them for long without much discomfort.3. The above ensures a good passive noise cancellation though (no ANC). Since it fully covers the ear, ~50% of the noise is cut down without music played, and ~75% while music is being played.4. It has a well-built structure and good quality materials and leather used (haven't used for long but will probably last).5. The headband has a metal strip running along, so it will remain sturdy.6. It has good flexibility. It is highly portable, and at its smallest, the overall dimensions are less than 18cm*13cm.7. The earcups can rotate along 2 axes, meaning they won't be vertically protruding when resting the headphones on the neck and shoulders.8. They have both wired and wireless options to listen to songs, so not useless if the battery dies down.  8.1. The AUX cable provided (which is 6.3mm to 3.5mm jack) is 1 metre long (sufficient for moving around a bit)9. Because they have 2 audio jacks, one can listen from 2 devices at the same time (for this, you will need an extra cable)  9.1. Alternatively, your friend/peer can connect their wired earphones/headphones on the extra jack and thus you both will be able to listen to the same movie/music at the SAME time, which is an AWESOME feature.Cons:1. It has a MicroUSB port, not a USB-C port (but the appropriate cable is provided in the pack so not big of a problem)2. Sound quality is not the best in the market, but pretty good in the price range. Just that audiophiles might not find it up to the mark.3. After a couple of hours, one might have to remove them to get some ventilation as the leather material doesn't let any air in, and might cause accumulation of heat.4. It is mildly heavy, so after a while, one may initially feel the need to remove them for some time.5. Maybe not appropriate to use while exercising, due to the same no-ventilation reason.6. The controls (volume, play/pause) and microphone only function in wireless mode. When in wired mode, they are pretty much like any other headphone (not headset) in all types of utility.7. Good quality plastic and leather is used, BUT I feel it might get worn easily. I will update this review after a little while of use.So, guys, those were the honest feedbacks of my experience with these headphones. All I can say is the 4.2 ratings these have got are well-deserved and NOT a result of tacky business tactics like giving incentives for giving a good rating (like in the case of OneOdio).They are definitely valued for money in this price range and will give you a bang for your buck‚Äîa premium experience at a fraction of the cost of other branded products.If you're not an audiophile or music connoisseur who is looking for a top-class experience, I see no credible reason for you not to check these out.Good luck out there. Cheers!"
5,"Writing this Review after testing it for a Month and I'm amazed by it's Performance...If you are planning to spend Rs.3000 on Headphones then I'll suggest you to go for Boltt Blast 140 Headphones an they are Over-Ear Headphones which has some great Sound Quality, Clarity and Deep Bass and one of the most important thing it has really Great Battery Life (20-25hrs).Morever I only charged these Headphones twice in a Month and I've using it daily for about 2-3 Hrs ...When I was purchasing these Headphones I was in doubt that only 9 people have bought them so far and price is also comparable to JBL and much higher than Budget Headphones king BOAT but when I took a risk and came to know that my risk was totally Worth and really Appreciate Team Bollt for these Wonderful Headphones...üíØüî•üëå"
4,Sound quality is very good . Excellent for listening to music . Below average while using for talking to people after connecting via Bluetooth to your Phone. People whom you are talking to complain they cannot hear you . No noice cancellation and you can also hear whom you are calling with difficulty. Listening to music on this is excellent
3,"Absolutely great product for listening purpose but not a great for calling or skype meeting microphone in this headphone below average and when you are talking over the phone or in meeting with this headphone the person at another end will feel that you are talking for a very long distance so, call quality is disappointing and many times it gives trouble to connect a microphone with skype calls.Connectivity is great. fast connect and autodetect. sometimes I experience noise glitches in this headphone so, noise cancellation is so so.In nutshell, if you are looking for an all-round product which will help you in calling, skype meetings, and binge-watching then, you should go for a higher range like Sony but not this. but if you are using this only for listening purpose then this product is value for money."
1,This is very bad product in this range . Upper features does not match as shown in the description. In this product noise cancellation problem is very high . When I am connecting my headphones to my laptop and using internet in my laptop seeing videos & listening üéß the  music üéµthen  my headphone disturb the voice of online videos and music.please listen the voice of customer and I have no customer support and I call the customer care but no response for me. And many issues my headphone such ex I'm listening the music then suddenly between the music beep sound and beep sound is irritating when I listening the song. So I request please doy buy this product. I boycott this company
4,"Have been using the headphone for over a year now and I will rate it 4/5 for its price range. I purchased the black version of the headset and I have mainly used it with wires with little wireless testing.Pros:1. Very comfortable. I have a larger head than average. I also wear glasses so if your looking for a headset that's comfortable with glasses on, this is a good product2. Battery lasts as long as advertised. No issue with bluetooth as well as battery life till now (I primarily use it wired though)3. The bass is not the strongest but its there and its comfortable to listen to. If your not a heavy bass music enthusiast, then you wont go wrong with this headphone4. Blocks some outside noise while listening to something, but when its silent you can hear everything. I dont listen to excessively loud noises or music while using my pc and yet I have missed out on conversations towards me at times due to noise cancellation/blocking.  Noise Cancellation rating 3/55. The ear cushion material was much more sturdy than most headphones in this and lower price range. My ear cushions deteriorate very quickly usually due to sweating etc.Cons:1. Music quality is a bit lower when using bluetooth. I forgot the reason why but its best using wires2. The headband is made of plastic which breaks in  ~ 1 - 2months on high usage especially at the left/right rotating junction for both speakers. I had to stick mine with super glue to continue using it  (no longer able to rotate the headphones left and right)"
4,"Well these Fire-Boltt Blast 1400 Over -Ear Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with 25H Playtime, Thumping Bass, Lightweight Foldable Compact Design with Google/Siri Voice Assistance are good enough to watch movies & listening normal music (normal music) because these headphones doesn‚Äôt support very Heavy Bass like (Sony MDR-XB450 On-Ear EXTRA BASS) Headphones have. Even they have HI-FI SOUND & CAPTIVATING BASS  40mm large-aperture drivers... then also the heavy bass Games, Music, & Movies doesn‚Äôt sound good.Noise Cancellation is kind of okay not that great.Bluetooth Connection is good enough.Battery good on single charge & use of 6 Horus daily battery backup runs for almost 1-2 days without charging. But there is one problem too that as soon as battery level comes low at 30% the sharp beep sound starts. The quality  of Aux Cable is not good.All over these  Fire-Boltt Blast 1400 headphones are good but not that great...!"

1,"This is quite a bad product for the price. Besides, the seller is not even bothered to package it properly. When it arrived, the cardboard boxes were clearly opened and even torn. I've attached images just after opening. It came in a terrible condition.The product is also bad. The bluetooth doesn't even connect properly to the TV. I finally succeeded in connecting it and the connection suffers once you're more than 4 feet from the TV. (The TV is an LG 55 inch in excellent condition). The sound quality is also poor. I don't understand all the rave reviews here for this poor product."
1,On Time delivery - 5 star for DeliveryAudio Quality - Not as mentioned.Calling - Too much of disturbance at time of calling.Too much of ear irritation & pain after wearing for merely 10 - 15 min.Overall review - NOT WORTH THE COST OF 1499/-Got the delivery on 27th Aug and initiated refund for the same on 28th Aug.Advice not to buy......
5,It's just awesome. I got the product at the correct time. Thank you Amazon. The sound quality is excellent. The bass is great. The earcups are very good. It gives a great experience of music . The clarity is pakka. I love this one and recommend to all. In this price it just great. Overall wonderful product.
4,"OK now I will give you a detailed review of Boat Rockers  400. I am reviewing after 10days I got the product.PROS :* Light weight. It is similar to carrying a 100 pages notebook* Sound Quality at the best level especially Bass is simply superb.*Noise cancelation is at the top.. I travel by local train often.. I sat near the Window seat and used this headphones one day, I was totally amazed at its noise cancelation. I am unable to hear a little bit of sound of the Running Train.*Dual working mode. This is simply superb, even battery is dead u can listen to music* Best battery.. I charged for less than 2hrs and used it about a week.*Cheap when compared to other brands. No brand offers Wireless headphone at this rate. Most of brand doesn't offer dual working mode too.*Boat offers one year warranty for this product. Any defects BOAT collects the product from door step and repair it and return it to the door step.CONS:*Only I problem with this is that it's not durable. But it's natural that if the headphones is of light weight then it won't be durable but it is better to increase the weight rather than being less durable.* Since it's less durable you have tocarry it with any POUCH else on Neck,. If you keep in bag there are more chances that it may break.*Wired mode and Bluetooth mode doesn't have same quality for all songs. Don't know whether it's song's mistake or Rockers 400 ''s mistake.*It's very small, at the initial stage I felt pain on ears if I use it more than 15 minutes.. Later I didn't feel such pain..Now my personal opinion is, if you are looking for a good headphones at cheap rate go for it.. Wait for any special offers. I got it on INDEPENDENCE DAY SALE @ 999 INR I also got 50rs as AMAZON PAY cashback.. So effective price is 950 INR.Wait for a best deal"
5,"I'm giving you a Honest ReviewPros1. Come with both feature you can use Wireless and Aux2. It is Foldable3. 6 Hours battery life after 2 hours of charging4. Good Noise CancellationCons1. Build Quality is Not good you should buy A headphone case2. It will hurt your ear but only for sometimeWithout thinking just go for it, No big brand will give you this Feature in this costHope You like my ReviewHave A Nice Day"
5,"I thought after reading the reviews, that the product would be bad, but trust me Boat Rockerz 400 is a very nice product. I personally am using it for about 6 months and there is no such problems. The provided aux cable and micro usb cable are of good quality and will not disappoint you."
1,You gets what you pay for. The headset is on offer for 999 most of the time. It's not worth it's mrp.The headset is very uncomfortable to wear and it's difficult to use for even 15 mins during the first week. The cushion is very hard and the finishing is rough. Both not suitable for a headset which press over the ears.The sound quality is just average what you could expect from a sub 1000 headset.One more annoying issue is the automated messages on turn on and connecting.
4,"1500 for a wireless headphones.... bit firm on your ears while using it for a long time, as need to adjust it them after 10mins, but amazing sound quality and a very good battery back up for around 5 hours. Boats banging... Definitely it's a yes from me..."
5,"Being wireless headphones, I was bit unsure of the output, battery longivity and the strength of the product prior purchasing it. The following review is after 2 months of normal every day of usage of 1 and half hours during my commute.Sound quality-----------------Positives-----------1. The output of music is fine and decent.2. Syncs well with every genre quite well to give a balanced sound output.3. The quality of the sound is deliverd as it should even at high volume level prohibiting any kind of distortion during playback.Negatives------------1. When connected via Bluetooth, if you are using online music apps say gaana for streaming music and you want to toggle to a chat app say watsapp or the sms interface to write a message, a slight attenuation of sound is heard when the headphone is trying to switch from music playback  to capture and play the keypress sounds through them.2. At low volume, noise cancellation is not effective enough irrespective of the genre being played.Battery life--------------Positives-----------1. As I have mentioned before, I use them almost 1 hour and 30 minutes in a day for 5 days a week which turns out to be 7 hours and 30 minutes as total usage once I charge them full. Although I charge them after the fifth day of use but then also the battery is not low which requires immediate attention and charge.2. It is great battery performance for what the company claims and for being a budget Bluetooth headphone.3. Even if some one who is a heavy user and find their headphone as their best companion for 8-9 hours a day, once charged full, it will keep you entertained for a good amount of time.4. The headphone can be used wirelessly even if it is on charge (NOT ADVISABLE).Negatives------------1. There is no way or an indicator to check the status of remaining charge of the battery and estimate the time to go zero.2. I have observed the charging time from 0% to 100% takes almost 2 hours and some minutes. So, please make a note of it.Material quality-------------------1. The design is simple and is sturdy.2. The cushion at the over head band is ok and gives optimum comfort.3. The height adjustable extenders seems to be metal which makes product feel strong and promising for a good amount of time.4. I have read multiple reviews where they say the cushions on the driver is painful initially and persists if used for long period. As the drivers are of standard size and not too big, if not placed correctly on the ears, may create pain for few. As it is greatly adjustable, just make sure you are expanding the sides of the headphone fully and just gently keep them on the ears. Do not press them inwards with your hands much. Thus, you can get good comfort and enjoy your music.My final verdict-------------------I am having no complaints about it's built quality, sound quality and battery performance. For a even better experience, I may upgrade to an expensive and high quality product some other time if I need to. But, I am convinced to a considerable extent with the headphones."
4,Sound quality is good. Not comfortable on ears if you wear it continuously. It pains due it's tight grip. Outer plastic package cover was intact but inside headphone package was in damaged condition. Not good.
2,"My expectation was too high for Boat. I bought a Bluetooth speaker boat 600, it was great. But this headphone have some problems. It makes a small ""piiii"" kind of sound and the bluetooth connection sound is so loud and cannot adjust the sound, will damage your ear. The sound is better than intex, iball and other lower brand obviously and battery life is good. So, 2 stars is what I'm giving."
1,"TL;DRBass is good for regular songs, but disappoints with bass heavy & trance music. Extremely disappointed with the Bluetooth performance. Also, amazon needs to re-check the hours they asked us to set for work addresses.It's been hours (not days, hours) since I received this product. I'll start with Amazon.I got this delivered to my office address. It says on my profile next to the address that it is my office address. Delivery times till 6 PM. But the delivery guys choose to ignore that tidbit. They decide to deliver it at/after 9 PM. Now, since the office is closed, they decide to leave it with the security guard. They did not call me to check if it was okay to leave it with the guards. I had not mentioned that it was okay to leave it with the guards in my order details. They just decided to do so of their own accord.Now we talk about the headphones themselves. The images were misleading to say the least. The earpieces are significantly smaller than expected. I was hoping they would cover my ears, but they are too small to do so. Then comes the most common problem that they are too tight. But since the boat support guy says they will loosen over time. Here's to hoping for the best. In the meanwhile, my ears will get crushed.Here's another problem. I wear prescription glasses. Now my ears are being crushed in the front by the headphones, and in the back by the temple (and temple tips). The only good thing that came out of this experience was that my glasses no longer fall off my face when I face down.Nevertheless, I put them on, hoping to hear some music. The Bluetooth connected easily, no problems there.But, and here comes the next issue, I can't shake my head to the music & I can't turn my head if somebody taps my shoulder. Basically I can't move my head. So now it feels like I have a neck brace that does not actually support my neck.Then, a fly happened to pass by. I raised my hand to move it from the way. And lo, another problem was displayed. If something appears in between the two i.e. the phone/laptop & the headphones, the Bluetooth starts cracking. And before we start blaming this on the laptop/phone, I tested this problem with a Bluetooth loudspeaker. Things worked fine there.And just to clarify, all of these issues happened within a distance of three feet (About one meter).Then I decided to test out the bass heavy songs. Put on trance music. And I was a little surprised that it was able to keep up. However I then cranked up the bass to see what happens. And was soon disappointed. The low frequencies in bass heavy trance are not as prominent as they should be. This is noticeable when there are prolonged periods of low frequencies.The aux cable is okay, nothing great. Works fine as expected.To sum up. It's a BIG NO from me.Update 1;I received a call while listening to songs, so I tried to test out the mic and if it works. I was shouting while wearing the headphones and the person at the other end of the line still complained of low voice. This happened once, so i thought, maybe they had the volume at a very low setting, then i got another call, this time for work. They also complained of not being able to listen my voice. Then i tried calling a friend and see if it works with them, as I can ask them directly to test it out with me and have them increase/decrease their volume. But sadly, no luck there.Had to return them. Maybe this was a defected piece. Placed for a replacement product. Let's hope the replacement they send is better.Update 2;The replacement they sent me was just as bad as the original one. Meaning, no boat rockerz for me. Very bad product. Design & Quality both. Changing the 2 star to 1."
5,"Now its already been so many days using this boat rockerz 400.I purchased headphones from this company for the very 1st time and believe me, this one is really something beyond my expectations even it's better than many other brands I used in the past, as far as price is concerned.So here is my review, what I really observed.‚ñ™Ô∏éSound quality is premium in terms of clarity and sharpness, not much distortion even at the maximum volume.‚ñ™Ô∏éBit BASE centric, if you love higher bass then you are surely gonna love it.‚ñ™Ô∏éNoise cancellation is far better than any other in this price range, can surely pick it up for calls as well.‚ñ™Ô∏éBluetooth range is pretty good, I roam around my entire house on the same floor, and feels its always connected.‚ñ™Ô∏éI never compromise with comfort, and in terms of comfortbility it is superb, it is as light, that no one can directly judge while looking at it once, but at the same time due to its lightness it is little fragile, so it should be taken care of.‚ñ™Ô∏éBattery is literally laudable, I really dont remember when I charged this one last time, I normally use 2-3 hours daily, and its around already a week without charging it.‚ñ™Ô∏éAux Support, yes even if there is no charge we can use the aux cable provided.‚ñ™Ô∏éPrice is low comparatively to other brands, so for me its always going to be a value for money deal.So at last the conclusion is, if you are searching for good bass along with comfort,lower price and yes if can take little care off, then you can go for this one without even a second thought.I will recommend this :)"
5,"It's best one now a days  as boat is trending today because of its bass and sound quality. It's excellent in condition and durable. Just Bluetooth is weakened sometimes if charging in less or my handset problem , obviously it will but I don't know what happens and I don't care coz it works most of the time best like 9 out of 10. And the headphone is little uncomfortable if your head is big it makes my ears pain you will need time to settle it down properly."
5,"It is awesome. I got the product delivery before time. Thank you Amazon.The sound quality is the best level especially bass is superb. Noise cancellation is on top and required for conference calls.Best battery backup, charging for 2 hours and I was able to manage it more than 8 hours.It comes with both features wireless and aux.It is also foldable in case required and light weight.Worth for the provided price, it is value for money."
1,"One of the best headphones in the price range.The material quality is good.Sound quality is great...Battery life ***** (5 star)But the disappointing feature is the Bluetooth range.. when I travel in train and keep my phone in the denim pocket and headphones on the ears...the music starts chopping... The Bluetooth doesn't disconnect but the music goes blank, skips..If I then keep the phone in my upper shift pocket or hold it in my hand...it then works fine. Also faced the same issue while travelling in a fast moving vehicle or walking under direct sunlight...But it works flawlessly indoors.I ordered a replacement thinking it could be a manufacturing defect...I received the product in 48 hours... So awesome delivery...and the same guy accepted my return product....but Im facing the same issue with the replacement headset as well....So it seems that the brand is unaware about this defect.I hope boatrockers get back to me on this.After a few days.... Same issue...  When I keep the  phone in the trouser pocket,  the music is not heared in the headphones... Poor reception... Tried with multiple phones/ brands...Moreover noticed a lot of issues when under sunlight.  Don't know you but I face these issues mostly when I'm under the open sky during the day."
3,"Hey guys, i bought these headphones in September2017 during great indian sale. It cost me around 999 rupees.So I'm writing this review after using these headphones for 1 year.‚óÜSound- sound quality is superb bass is good and songs are clear even at high volume so 5 stars to boat for sound quality.‚óÜBluetooth connectivity- Bluetooth connectivity is, i would say average. Because sometimes connection breaks when i put my phone inside the pocket of my pants.‚óÜ Battery life- Battery life is guys amazing. Battry lasts upto 6-7 hours easily aven after intensively using these headphones for 1 year.I used to listen songs using aux cable and i guess that's why headphone jack of my phone got loose. So I'm all dependent on Bluetooth now.I would suggest you guys not to use aux cable with your mobile phone because your headphone jack might also get loose.‚óÜ Some ppl say in reviews that headphones are tight. Yes headphones are tight when new. But you will get used to it within 1-2 weeks. I can now watch 2 full movies back to back without any pain in my ear or head.‚óÜ Build quality- The only con that this headphone has is POOR BUILD QUALITY.Guys headband of my headphones broke in just month after buying it. And once headband breaks, your headphones are completely useless. I glued it using fevikwik. After that it broke many times,it kept breaking from same place again and again so i got fraustrated and filled it with 1 full pack of 5 rupee fevikwik. After that it didn't break from that place but broke at another place.So in total it has broken multiple time from 4 places.I glue it and keep using it. It breaks and i glue. This is happening since last one year.And this does not come under warrenty.Final words- Guys sound quality is superb you cannot get this sound quality at this price point and Battery life is also good.Only con is the build quality of these headphones. If you're ready to glue it again and again, go buy itüëç"
1,Be careful. Your ears will get pain due to its poor design. Sound quality is very good but you can not use for long. They do not accept return.
1,"Amazon Delivery and Sound quality of the headphones are ok. Found another problems with this product. I use to use this product 3-4 times a week. Head band broke on 5th month. I called Boat customer care and they said that the band is NOT covered under warranty as it is a physical damage. Product will be covered under warranty if there is an issue with bluetooth or sound quality. if I want to fix the band, then I have to pay. I felt very bad as the band broke for normal usage. Second thing - Ear will pain if you wear it for more than 30 mins. It is unbearable after 45 mins. It is unusable now and  I switched to another brand and it is working perfectly. Bluetooth connectivity is bad. if you are using it while walking, then it gets worse. Don't think about using it over the call. bad call quality. Flimsy plastic build. I will never buy any product of BOAT again."
4,"The charging lasts over a day if you use it a lot. Bluetooth connectivity is good, output is great. Only 1 con- if you use it for a long period your ears will hurt a little bit."
5,"Build Quality: 5/5 for overall quality but 4 for quality of buttons.Sound Quality: 5/5 for all types of music , you can listen to the details of the song with the best bass .Battery Life: 5/5 up  to the mark.Bluetooth Connectivity: 5/5 with in minute it was paired for new device it depends on your quality of the phone/laptop you are using, In this case it is oneplus phone.call connectivity: 3/5 slight disturbance at the receiving end not worth for phone on bluetooth avoid or connect the aux cable provided.Value for money: @999 6/5 :)Amazon delivery and Shipping : 5/5 with in 2 days as I am prime member :)Buy it is worth for the money you give for this product."
1,"I bought this headphones, thinking that this would be a great product, after watching its ratings. Boy, I couldn't been more wrong.First, if you have glasses(specs) don't even think of buying this headphones. It hurts a lot after 10mins of wearing. You may have this pain hours after using it. Your ears will be crushed between headphones and specs' temples.Second, Even if you don't have specs, you can think of this product, But I won't recommend it.Third, It's microphone stopped working after a week of use. And won't connect with Bluetooth on my phone / laptop.Fourth, *IT CANNOT BE RETURNED! Yes, you could only REPLACE it with a new but same model. If you don't want this product, there isn't much you can do about it after once buying it.The sound quality, noise cancelling and battery backup is good though.GOD, I am writing this review with pain in my ears."
4,"Bought these for a friend but used them for a week straight and these are my thoughts for these headphones.Pros:-Build is good, Made entirely of plastic and it is hard.-Headphone cable and charging cables are provided with the headphones and are of averagely good quality.-Bass is good and profound in these headphones.-The Bluetooth connectivity is good and works for 8 meters straight and 5 meters with 1 wall in between.-Battery life is good and lasts easily for 5 hours with 70% volume.Cons-The hard plastic is prone to scratches if used roughly.-The earcups are not of good quality.-The headphone clamp is too high for my big head, I felt fatigued after an hour of usage.-The bass is too muddy and takes over all the frequency responses.-Mids are recessed and highs are not detailed for the price.-Distorted Guitars and Sub- Bass is not represented well and the high end sometimes becomes too shrill for my ears.Overall for the price this is the only headphones with averagely good performance and Bluetooth connectivity. I would totally recommend this headphone if you chose portability over the sound and comfort.If this review helped you in anyway, do click the like button below."
1,What's the point in selling resale units to customers with damaged packaging!!! If resale units are sold can't they be done in a complete new package!!!And above all the controls on the headphone doesn't work with the Audio jack plugged in!!! It only works in Bluetooth/Wireless mode!!! That's just ridiculous!!!
1,I bought this product seeing thousands of reviews and even 1-2 of my friends had it. But the problems started right in the first week.The headphones keep getting disconnected from the phone's bluetooth as soon as you pause the song or the video and this keeps happening every few seconds which is very annoying. BoAt replaced the product since it was within warranty but the new ones had the exact same issue. Seemed like they returned the same headphones back to me. Now I'm waiting for my 2nd replacement.I would request everybody not to buy these headphones at any cost.
3,"There is only problem with this earphone - BAD Design! The sound quality is excellent, bass is good and battery backup is also good.. BUT the fitting is so rigid that once you place the headphones on your head, your ears will start paining badly in barely 10 minutes and will be red in no time.. the pressure is too much on the ears and you can't adjust in anyway to make it any better.. Too bad because this would've been a great product otherwise."
2,PLEASE DO READ MY REVIEW BEFORE BUYING IT OR YOU WILL REGRET THIS.If you are looking for good bass quality you will regret buying this product and if you want Crisp and clear sound quality you will regret it. I request you please don't buy this product at all is you want a normal quality or maybe you can say low quality headphones then you can purchase it. It's really bad quality headphone. I replaced the order so that I was thinking it was a defect part or the sound must be defect but this was my biggest mistake by doing this. They send a defect one with inside box opened already and broken headphoneüò° I really don't understand why do they send this broken once why could not they check it while sending to costumers or are they doing it on purposely . Anyways I regret it buying this earphones and wasting my money and I want to return it back again and I want my money back. And I'll go some good brands like Sony or JBL. Pleaseeeee read this review I'm not any bot writing this or I'm not doing it for fun why would I waste my time and write a review üòë Thank you.
4,"The model ""boat rockerz"" itself says It's rocking...Sound quality is gud..it has good bass & one can feel  stimulation of our ear drum..The only drawback is it's not that much convenience.. one can hear songs only for few mins after that the tightness over the head causes pain in our ear & headache... It's  not recommended for long time use."
1,"Bluetooth connectivity is pathetic,the moment you start the music and put your phone in your pocket and start walking,you hear grrr sound, and you keep hearing it frequently in between the tracks,and it keeps loosing connectivity completely if you are listening and walking together.bad experience.bad product."
1,"Not Expected from Boat, Waste of Money, I paid for this 1714/- I only Bought this for Pubg GameI am a Big Fan of PUBG game and please don‚Äôt even think of buying this product for playing games like PUBG. There is a sound issue while playing the game u r not able to here the sound in game delay 3 second while playing games This happened to me while playing  PUBG only. Moreover, you just can't hear a thing when you play pubg using the Bluetooth mode. You'll have to connect the aux cable to hear it.the mic quality is not so good. it's not durable. but it is better to increase the weight rather than being less durable.Wired mode and Bluetooth mode doesn't have same quality for all songs. when I put my phone into my pocket I constantly have to carry my phone in my hand and that too I has disturbances if I move sound quality is not good these are very uncomfortable not expected this from boat either it is a faulty product or boat makes such bad products my recommendation don't buy it you will regret later and they don't even change your product, Also this blue tooth has pathetic distance. I go at most 4 meters and if there‚Äôs no line of sight with the phone connection starts disconnecting.Sound quality is average and sometimes you can feel a disconnect in audio is volume is below a certain level. Build quality is such that you can't wear it for more than an hour because your ears will start to hurt. I use Skull candy headphone before this as comparison boat rocketzz 400 was dumb you can only able to hear base and little amount of songs sounds .and it's connectivity was poor only at aux mode its goodOverall it is an average product but at this price is very high,My ear will start paining after 30 minute usage. Will get distracted. So this product is not recommended for watching film. Another issue I had noticed recently is it does not connect automatically with my laptop which If I goto Bluetooth settings it shows the headphones is connected but I will need to reconnect it again..Waste of money, even my Sony 110 for 599 is more comfy.My expectation was too high for Boat."
4,I had purchased this product one year before.Pros.1) Sound it Loud and crisp2) Very Good Bass3) Very Good Battery Life (I am getting approx 5 hrs 30 mins with one charge after 1 whole year)4) Supports Dolby and Windows Sonic (I had tried both)5) Material is good6) Service is good (In past my service experience with boat is good)Cons1) Its hard one ear (I am getting pain if i use continuous more than 1 hrs)2) Materiel is good but not slandered3) Bluetooth not so powerful (some time Bluetooth starts losing connectivity if any person comes between device and headphones.Its main con is we cant use it for long it hurts on ear.
3,"It‚Äôs a nice blue tooth headset. It‚Äôs not a very comfortable one though, prolonged use can put a strain on your ears, because it‚Äôs non adjustable. The buttons are just okay, as they are not properly designed. The noise cancelling is there but not so much. The ear heads should have been slightly bigger.You can get the phone calls on this devise but it kills the clarity and microphone is not great. Not best for talking on phone, but can manage quick calls.All said, in comparison to other products of similar price range or lower it‚Äôs a good headphone. Can say it‚Äôs okay for the average sound quality which is not bad but not great either. The battery backup is good, but could have been better. The spine padding is fine. Design wise it‚Äôs simple and clean, which is a plus.So if you‚Äôre on a budget and want a decent Bluetooth headset, go for this. Don‚Äôt have high expectations and this will serve you good"
5,"First of all Thank You Harman for launching an affordable headphone. Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it. You won't regret afterall it is by HARMAN.#thelongestreview?"
1,Not liked because his product is made in China so that I am returning
5,"Would I recommend this product to others? Definitely yes.Pros:Light WeightBattery LifeCons:No 3.5 mm cable, only blue toothI was in search of a light weight wireless headphone that I can use for long hours. I have a Bose now but I cannot use it for longer than 2-3 hours as its heavy and ears and head start aching.This Infinity one wins there. I have used it for 6-7 hours without any aches or pains.The ear pieces do press a little on the ears unlike over-the-ear ones. This one is on-the-ear.  But it is not uncomfortable and gives a good fit.The sound quality is good too. Noise cancellation is not big. With low volumes, you can hear surrounding noise.Battery does last for a long long time. I used it daily for 4-5 hours for about 3 days with one charge. Am truly impressed with it.And it folds, hence carrying it around is convenient too.And I got it in the lightning deal at 1500 Rs. Worth the price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a non-expensive wireless headphones with a decent sound quality.I am giving it a 4 because I am not sure of its durability. If it lasts foe 6 months at least, then I will come back and update the rating to a 5."
5,"Hi all,After a week rough usage i am sharing my opinion.i through that under 1499 INR i should not expect the headset with all features except sound,but this one made ,my through wrong.One of the best budget product it is. ""Infinity (JBL) Glide 500 Wireless On-Ear Dual EQ Deep Bass Headphones with Mic (Charcoal Black)"".Pros:--1.product quality is good on this price.2.sound quality is extraordinary,especially ""Gaana website songs"" are awesome,prime video streaming sound experience just like a theater.3. Battery backup ~20hrs is good is this product.Cons:--1.aux port not enabled in this version.2.No other reasons here."
1,"Hello Amazon Team,In the Carton box it is mentioned as Manufactured in USA but in the product it mentioned as China . This is breach case , pls look into & Update."
2,"I bought this headphone as a replacement for my in-ear headset. I attend lot of office calls due to WFH. I wanted to have a Bluetooth headphone with great battery life and decent mic quality. To be honest, I can't use these headphones for more than a hour, my ears are paining a lot. The cushioning is very poor and cheap quality. Giving two Star, as it is basic sense to design a headphone with proper cushioning for comfort. People who enjoy too much bass can be happy."
5,This product is better than its old counterpart i.e. JBL infinity 501. With more upgraded features in an affordable price and under a trusted brand. The most catchy thing is it's 36 mm driver and 72 hours playback time as compared to earlier 20 hrs. playback.
1,This is waste of money. Guys Don't go for this headset you will get lot of ear pain and you can't feel any Bass exist in it. Please don't buy it I had purchased later I found such a worst product and returned immediately.
5,"I am impressed with sound quality of Infinity glide 510. It's a value product at a reasonable price. My initial impressions.Pros:1. Good sound quality- mids and highs are clear even with a punchy bass.2.Decent build quality at this price.3.Excellent Bluetooth connectivity and range. I am especially impressed with the range.4. Battery life of 72 hrs which is an unbelievable offer at this price.. (I can't comment on battery life now)5.Pretty decent noice cancellation ( not active)Cons:1.The Deep Bass mode is useless, which spoils the sound quality ( It is set in deep bass mode, you can change it to normal mode by long pressing the volume keys together)2. I could feel the pain on the ears after an hour's usage.I am sure, you won't be disappointed with this product. It's quite a catch at this price. Hope it will be durable."
1,"Highly disappointed and dissatisfied . Can't wear for more than 30 min as it starts to pain , completely against of claims in advertising . Battery backup claimed as 72 hrs ... practically 15 hrs . Cushion on ear cups are not soft enough. Bluetooth disconnected after 7-8 metrs ,  If one scrutinized the reviews well , he can understand that top reviews are paid or Fake ."
5,Its awesome product...thumping base...ears vibrating bass..bery good sound quality and in a affordable pricing...
4,"1#Actually its hell of a product I have been using for quite long and this is what I feel about it:Pros-1.Battery -It has a long lasting battery as about 72hrs( as company claims) but I am sure no one using it for continuous 72hrs but what I felt is that when I unboxed the product it was 80% and after 3 days of regular usage like music,youtube,movies I was able to make 3 days with 50%remaining i.e 30% for 3 days and it took me about 45 min to chagre it up to 80%2.Sound quality and bass-This thing is a beast regarding bass and sound quality I can asure you that this wont even dissappoint you in case of sound quality and for bass,if you bass lover like me it got 2 mode-normal and deep bass.If you cant feel enough bass at normal mode you can easily shift to deep bass mode by pressing +and -button together then you will feel an astonishing bass effect even you can feel the headphone starts vibration at each beat and if this doesnt make you enough then I recommend you to meet an E.N.T for check-up Dude belive me it's crazy3.Bluetooth range-Its just great because its version 5.0 and provide greater range even after crossing 3 rooms you can get adequate range without breaking any signal4.Microphone-its like a bonus because it has good audio recording but the only problem is that it works only during calling i.e you can use it to record or send voice message in whatsapp5.Usage of buttons is just as simple as it seemsLets get to cons:(Only two minor ones)1.comfort-Actually it is only one negative thing I felt about the device after my first usage .It is a bit uncomfortable to wear and you will feel a slight pain over your pinna (external ear )after using for 1 hr ,but now I became adjust to it now I can wear it for hrs without any problem belive me,it can take some time to adjust and after that you won't feel any problem plus it's is weight less and small device so you will easily adjust within one day2.Plastic quality-(It is my feeling that )it seems to be a little fragile during transport especially keeping it in a bag so beware of thatOther than these 2 minor factor I never felt anything bad about this device.So my verdict is that I usually loves to hear music with a good bass and effect and I have used many device from Sennheiser,Ant audio,Jbl,Boat,Skullcandy,Audio technica,Sony and many more so from my experience I will recommend this device to many and I would say THIS IS THE BEST HEADPHONE IN THE MARKET THAT PROVIDE BLUETOOTH AND SOUND QUALITY AT THIS REASONABLE PRICE POINT IF YOU ARE GONNA BUY A HEADPHONE UNDER 1000 JUST PUSH YOUR MAXIMUM TO THIS PRICE POINT IT WILL ALWAYS BE WORTHY.A GOOD PRODUCT FROM HARMAN AUDIO /JBL AS ALWAYS#But all these good factors vanishes because of the horrible comfort that is why I gave 4 star.Otherthan comfort this is awesome"
1,I absolutely hated it from the moment I started using it. It feels so cheap. Even though I was sitting right in front of my laptop it got disconnected multiple times. My ears started to get hot after some time. I'm trying to return it but apparently I can only replace it. DO NOT BUY THIS!! IT IS A SCAM ! U CAN'T GET A REFUND! THEY WILL send u the same thin again!
1,"Pls don't purchase it. It has a sound in right side of headphone. Harman group had told me to send this product. I had parcelled this which cost me around Rs 400. Now they have returned the item again to me without any notice. And when I called, they are saying there is no fault. Such a poor customer service.Sincere request, don't purchase it. It has a prominent sound like vibrating string. Add to this such a poor customer care. Their behaviour is shameless. They should learn from Amazon.Update on 20.nov.19: Customer service of Harman group are shameless. I had some recordings. Everytime they will say we will call you back after 24 hours. But they will never call. I am going to file a case in consumer court.Its not a good headphone at all. Pls purchase other item. Forget about customer care, sound quality is not good. There is a Continous belling soung.Thank you"
3,"SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD, BUT THE HEADPHONES ARE TIGHT AND MAY GIVE YOU PAIN ON LONG USAGE. I have not been able to use it for long time since it's too tight for me... And Irony is Amazon doesn't want give refund to me. I want to go for in-ewr headphones but still they don't want to give the refund. And cherry on cake is Customer care shouts on the customer... @Amazon you need to train your customer care people. Ridiculous experience. Please give my money back if you can so I can have another headphones.Update: Amazon gave my money back, and i was able to buy another headphones. Thank you Amazon."

1,"Hey guys , read this before you buyI bought the headphones 1 month ago which was around 14-15 sep. Everything was going well. Exactly after 1 week, which is 21st sep I used the headphone for 3 hrs to attend some meeting and as soon as I disconnected it the headphones stopped working.  I went to the phone shop they said they won't repair this. I wrote a complain at Harman website they had no response.. please Amazon  have a look at this product and I will wait for the reply.Regards"
5,"Superb clarity. Bass in normal mode is enough, no need to change the EQ setting. Highs are little less bright but still comprehensible. Vocals sometimes feel muddy but looking at the price range, there cannot be better headphones. This is top notch quality in this price. Far better than Boat, far far better. No comparison, in fact. JBL is JBL."
1,"It worked fine for first 2 weeks, It's now less than 15 days and it stopped working.Not sure if It charges properly... I can see the red light while charging. Then click and hold power button to start - power button seems to be not working.Is there any reset button to auto fix settings?It's useless now. I can't return it as after 10 days as per return policy. I have 1 year warranty. I don't know how to claim that.It's not a good experience."
5,"The build and sound quality of this thing is awesome. I upgraded to this after my Sennheiser cx 180 street ii broke. For all those who are wondering it comes with a 610 mah battery. I am by no way a audiophile but the sound i feel is excellent. It was by default in bass boosted mode and i switched it back to normal. Battery life, Durability all those things will be updated in a future update. I feel it was a bit uncomfortable for large head, mine is xl üòù but not that troublesome (3/5 for comfort). Edit : The sound of the headphone is excellent after burning in for more than 10 hours. You get used to the headphones after sometime. So yeah its more comfortable now. 2 days of 3 hour per day use in medium volume gets battery down by 10%. Buy this thing eyes closed."
4,"I purchased this on 28 August, it was delivered on 31 August. The delivery was good. Now to the headphones,this headphones has all the things you need to called this headphone. I mean the sound quality is excellent. Bass is good. No distortion in taking calls and decent build quality. It kinda look like jbl t460bt younger brother. I have given 4* because it has a minor issue of producing a sound like ""ting ting"" when you touch or tap right side of the headphones. But it doesn't bother that much so it's a sweet deal. Hope you can enjoy this product.Update: 27 may 2020- I have been using this for past 8 months and their sound quality is best considering it's battery life and build which is far good than other headphones available. The only one drawback is their are not much comfortable. So if you can compromise a bit then go for it."
1,"This is made in China product (written on the box). It's showing it's nature from first day. If sound is not played for 3-4 min and then you play any sound the headphones will not respond until you until you pair it again. I don't know if it is happening with me only. In one hour I noticed 3-4 time sound stopped for like half sec which I did not expected from JBL, me and my phone were on same bed .Sound is nice but breaking half sec between songs is not acceptable. Bad bluetooth connection.I literally search JBL is US brand but still they have quility like Chinese products."
5,"Mind Blowing 3D surround sound Experience, I have sennheiser and Sony headphone but really this headphone is amazing, every notes and vocal r clear and bass is very very very awesome when u r switched in powerful bass such u feel with new bass experience. Overall I give full rate 5/5"
5,"Here is my detailed review of this product after a week of usage:1. Build quality:Earlier was sceptical a bit about on-ear headphone that the outer ear will pain after long use. But this one comes with great built, comfort, lightweight and handy that one can use for longer period without any discomfort.2. Sound quality:I'm an audiophile. Love to hear every single frequency from low to high and set my theatre for the same. Here comes the sound of this product it'll really produce the low frequency approx 80-100hz which is really good for such small speaker resulting good bass, clear sound with balanced trable.Noise cancellation is as expected. You'll be cut out from outer world.3. Bluetooth control and battery:Bluetooth is working as expected and can be achieved at a distance of 10-15 mtrs. Control buttons are good with proper sensitivity battery lasted 18 hours of regular use.Over all a nice product from Herman and can buy without having second thoughts."
5,"This is my first Bluetooth Overhead headphone.Reason why I do not prefer Bluetooth headphone is due to its poor battery backup and sound quality, I always prefer Wired headphones also for its sound quality.But this headphone is a game changer1. Battery Backup: this headphone is really great in the battery backup. I was an average listener and game player. So it was giving a backup for more than a week easily for me. I never thought of charging it from the day I bought it.2. Sound effect: The sound is absolutely good with some equaliser and it‚Äôs best with power amp, and some music player which has custom equaliser in Android. If you are iPhone user and wanna enjoy music in default music player , then it‚Äôs not for you. However we can install some third party music player with equaliser and enjoy the music (eg: onkyo player).And the best part of the headphones is enjoying a movie with deep bass mode. If you are looking for a headphone to enjoy movies for long time with best bass boosted high volume sound effect then go for this without thinking. I really enjoy watching Marvel collections since I‚Äôm marvel fan. Oven never enjoyed such a deep bass anywhere. Even in laptop the movies sounds great with VLC media player(subjected to best equaliser settings).3. Comfort: The headphone gives a great comfortable tight fit. I‚Äôm a big head guy and it‚Äôs really so hard. I can‚Äôt wear it for more than 20 min. But I gave the same headphone to my brother and sister, everyone is comfortable wearing for so long. So I wear it in a different angle and it helps me to fit comfort. This is definitely for round headed people, it has a huge extension but still there is no adjustment for horizontal flexible adjust fit.4. Build Quality: So good and sturdy. Light weight and foldable.5. Noise Cancellation: It gives a nice noise cancelling sound environment with more than average volume level. Compression is perfect for normal head. Since I have round and huge head, it is not giving perfect closure to ears if I extend the length of the adjustment. That‚Äôs the only problem for me. Never mind if you are normal headed.Mic: During call and gameplay I never had a complaint from other end. They can hear my voice clearly.Drawbacks: It does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack and I can‚Äôt enjoy the Dolby Atmos effect from my laptop. For this extreme bass headphone if it gives me option to connect and enjoy the music I would be so happy. But it can‚Äôt be bundles with all futures right. That‚Äôs negligible for me.Overall it‚Äôs a Best Buy for the price range. I really enjoy it and my family is enjoying with this headphone.Thanks"
4,"I wasn't able play pubg connecting with this headset, you will get the fire sound or foot sound with delay of 2 seconds so you can't sync the sound of game which you hear in headset and game play."
4,Sound is good but will only work with mobileNot with laptop or anyother device
5,Infinity Glide 500 is very accurate in terms of sound quality. Build quality seems to be not so good because all is plastic. I was comparing this with Jbl T460 bluetooth headphone. The INFINITY GLIDE 500 is having puncy bass. I could say that bass is little bit overpowering...there is option to switch ON the deep base mode but believe me friends I could never feel the need to enable deep base mode. The bass is too much even in normal mode. So bass lovers will like this headphone for sure. Please allow some time to burn the headphone to produce quality sound. First day you may not feel the headphone good but believe me from second day I was just in love with this as it produces sharp details. So burning time is required to free up the components of headphone. Battery backup is tremendous...as compared to Jbl T460. Jbl T460 has just 11 hours whereas this headphone has 20 hours backup. Price is also very low.Thanks.UPDATE AFTER USING 3 WEEKS:This headphone has really became my travel mate...This has bluetooth 5.0 and it does not even disconnects in Mumbai crowded local trains. Your phone should support bluetooth version 5.0 and it will connect with this headset seamlessly. Lower bluetooth versions are also supported of course...But 5.0 is great for connectivity and battery optimization.EQ mode is not that great and it does not give any difference and there is really no need to push for deep base....it is just awesome in normal mode....Flexible to carry and travel...Great headphones.
2,"I was expected a lot from this Bluetooth headset, but disappointed very much.It like a normal piece, not worth to buy for Rs1700"
1,"Today, I have received Glide 500 wireless on-ear headphone. But the product is not as good as I have heard abt it. I purchased it for brand name HARMAN but sound quality especially Bluetooth connectivity is so irritating that I prefer to return this. I played music on ganna app as well as songs available in my phone but same problem exist both the time. Every 4-5 seconds a interruption occurred and sound became low. So I recommend not to buy this."
1,"I first owned a Bose QC35, however, I felt Bose was not innovating in terms of sound control and technology. This led me to buy the Sony WH-1000XM2 which I used for over a year without any trouble. I was completely happy with them. When Sony released Sony WH-1000XM3, I took the plunge and bought them in November 2018. After a month of using them, I began to hear crackling noises from the ear cups. I ignored them thinking they were some issue with the Bluetooth connection. This issue pursued and the noises became so unbearable that when they randomly came up, I had to immediately remove the headset from my wearing. At this point, I decided to Google the issue and was shocked to see that this was a common issue in most Sony WH-1000XM3.Most of the above issues came up in the warranty period and most, if not everyone had their headsets replaced, however, the shocking part is that many complain that the issues persisted in the new headsets too. Looking at the bright side and the brand name, I was very confident that a new Firmware release would fix everything and just as I thought, there was soon a release, although the issue was not listed, I was hopeful. The new Firmware release did not fix the issue.I still could not get the headsets to the service centre, as I had a long journey coming up, I was considering to use them and then take them to service after my trip, only because the sounds were random and sometimes, they did not show up for a day or two. This was not to be and all of a sudden, the headsets died on me, they would show up in the connection but they would not respond or play music. I tried multiple devices with no luck. It was time to make a trip to the service centre.5th February 2019 (Day 1) I reach Pranank Electronics Sony Authorised Service Centre at around 10. The place is a mess and the receptionist was at her lethargic best, but I believe, she was not trained to handle customers. I asked if I could speak with a technician, when she heard my problem, she just asked for an invoice and my headset, registered a complain and assured me there was no need to speak with anyone as this is a 100% non-repairable product and I will receive a replacement in 7 Days. Feeling upbeat about what she said, I left and went about my business.6th February 2019 (Day 2)I call up Pranank Electronics Sony Authorised Service Centre as a follow up as, on hindsight, I did not believe something could be so simple in India. I spoke with the same lady and she put me on hold and asked their technician about the status. She confirmed, the Sony WH-1000XM3 was dead and a request for replacement has been placed. I asked her if they needed to send this dead Sony WH-1000XM3 for a replacement or if the replacement will arrive without this process being done.12th February 2019 (Day 7)I call Pranank Electronics Sony Authorised Service Centre and was told they did not have an update for me. They asked me to call the Sony Toll Free number. I visit the website and raise an escalation case using my job number. I receive a response within hours. I also get a call from Pranank Electronics Sony Authorised Service Centre mentioning they had a call from their regional office and that they were being pressurised into trying different firmware's, the technician who spoke with me also mentioned that they are preparing an internal firmware which did not have a public release yet and wants to try that and see if that will fix my Sony WH-1000XM3. I was shocked to hear that everyone was working hand in hand and I was told, the local guys were getting pressure from above to keep me at bay. This really is a trust breaker on a brand such as Sony, I bought my Sony WH-1000XM3 for around Rs. 30,000 and after facing issues and bringing a dead set within 90 days and here we are where they are trying to just about make it work and give it back to me.22nd February 2019 (Day 18)As I was travelling for the 10-day gap, I could not really get in touch with them and neither my local service centre or Sony tried to get in touch with me to give me an update. I called Pranank Electronics. The technician was nice enough to inform me that the effort to not give a replacement and fix the existing one was still on. Now that they determined the problem was a faulty motherboard and they were waiting to determine the part number so could order it in. I have no words to describe this deceit. On one hand, I was told that this is a non-repairable item by every person I spoke to representing Sony and on the other hand here we are where they are trying every possible manner to just make it work and dump it on me.I write to Sony, but no response. I explain that I do not want a repair and want a replacement.23rd February 2019 (Day 19)I write to Sony, but no response.25th February 2019 (Day 21)Sony writes back acknowledging that efforts to repair the item are no longer in place and they have placed an order for a headset. We would like to inform you that, we have placed an order for¬†headset and we are arranging the stock from our sources. We assure you that care is taken to ensure the service as early as possible. We assure you that care is taken to ensure the product is delivered as early as possible.6th March 2019 (Day 30)I write a follow up as it has been over 10 days since they placed the order. I begin to wonder if they are looking for a refurbished piece of junk to dump it on me.No response.8th March 2019 (Day 32)I write to them. No response.12th March 2019 (Day 36)I call Pranank Electronics but no one picks up. I try thrice over an hour, but no one picks up. I call Sony on their Toll-Free number. The person picks up, does not apologize, treats it just like normal. I ask when I will have my headset and I am informed that she will expedite it and I will get the replacement headset by the end of this week, which will be¬† 16th March. Sony also has an online option to find the status of the job which is literally useless and give random results. At the moment, it displays that the product has been serviced.14th March 2019 (Day 38)I received a call from Pranank Electronics informing me that the replacement has arrived and I can pick it up. It has to be seen how this replacement works or if they have given a brand new set or a refurbished one.15th March 2019 (Day 39)Upon reaching Pranank Electronics, I was shocked to see that there were massive letters written with a sketch on the box of the headsets. I was under the assumption that these were new. To my surprise, they had repaired my headsets and were giving me back my headsets and not a replacement as promised right from day one. I called the manager of the store and he had no clue about this replacement promise that his staff and the sony centre had made. I called Sony care on the toll-free number. The person who picked up the call had no clue what was going on but did acknowledge that a replacement request was placed. I explained and refused to take the repaired headset, he asked me to hand over the phone to the service centre staff. I had no idea what he spoke but he finally told me that I will be getting a call from the service centre and that he was escalating my case with utmost priority. I was terribly disappointed.I am not sure how long this will go on for but I am having a nightmare with these, the reason I refuse to take a repaired headsets is because of their short lifetime and also because I was explicitly told that these were a non-repairable product and somehow they have repaired them."
5,"This is my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones! So NOT AN Expert opinion :P-) Noise Cancellation is like using a tight In-Ear headphones But this is more comfortable-) This will block external noise like AC, FAN, Rain etc. Block means not 100% but 80 to 90%!-) If you play music! You will not hear anything from outside world! (As I said an In-Ear headphones do the same but it will be slightly painful)-) A tight In-Ear headphones are not a replacement for Built in Noise Cancellation! I just point it out to the people who never experienced a Noise Cancellation headphones in life. This Noise Cancellation is Another level. You will only believe it when you actually get a chance to use it. NO YouTube reviews will give you the real experience.This Noise Cancellation Headphones is useful WHEN- I watch youtube videos / tutorials- I write code- I brainstorming- I travel- I go to bed and hear some songs before sleep- I need to disconnect from the annoying world! around me :)Battery life is really good. USB-C means one less cable, Fast charging is good!, Touch control is awesome, if you put right hand to right ear cup you can come back to the world you are in. it is a huge plus, when mom are dad call me! all I need to do is put my hand on the right ear cup!Overall this NC Headphone Improved my life! Here is how.- Now I can focus more on my work- Less distraction from external noise (It is not 100% But 99% of the time it is 100%)- I hate travelling because of the the sounds and noise will influence my thoughts, I actually waste my time while travel because of that. yes a good In-Ear earphone can help but this is another level. So now I can actually do my stuff in my own world using this Noise Cancellation Headphones!Value?Yes -- if you have 30K to throw away. And it will not hurt your life in any way.No -- if you need to save money for next 12 Months to get this.Sound Quality?Base is there! If you are looking for that.But the nice thing is Sony's EQ can Adapt! That means anyone can change the Sound Aspects according to there needs from the Application. Out of the box it is perfect for my taste!If someone like less base you can change that through EQ.No product is perfect so in this Model what to improve?- Only once device can be connected at a time. (Minimum 2 devices is required now a days! [eg Laptop and SmartPhone])- User replaceable ear cup cushions!- Call Quality. This Headphones have an array of microphones but when when we call someone they will hear all Background Noise. I used it for some VOIP calls, It is usable but built in Microphones on your phone will do a much better job.- More and improved NC! Yes why not. There is always room for improvements.^^ I really don't know what to write as cons.I will Update this after using this for a week or two. bye.Ôªø"
5,Just received my 1000MX3 . Just as you would expect from Amazon. Everything was perfect. Burned just four songs from my Apple Music playlist. That was all that was needed to make my decision. I have been using my QC 35 since the last year or so and used to use it a lot for streaming . I and my wife have a completely opposite tastes in TV Viewership therefore one of us uses the headphones. Noise cancelling is hands down better than QC 35 and sound quality is also better if just slightly so . The feature of allowing outside sound while keeping a hand on one of the cups is also very good. This is my very first impression. Maybe I‚Äôll follow up with a more detailed review after using it more . For now I‚Äôll say that if you‚Äôre confused between QC 35 and 1000Mx3 I‚Äôll say go for the Sony
5,These are my initial thoughtsThey definitely look premiumSound Quality is quite impressive even at full volume doesn't distort.You will hear so much more of a song beacuse of the clarity.I am using Saavn to play music at 320kbpsNoise Cancelling is great but will still have to use it in real scenarios.Ears do feel a bit warm after sometime  but I think Mumbai's humid weather is probably to be blamed.Overall extremely excited to use themI would highly recommend these over the Bose QC35s.
4,Likes1. Great sound quality2. Amazing battery with fast charging(Type C).10 mins of charging led to 70% battery3. Comfortable to wear and Noise cancelling is great4. Bass can be controlled via connect app.In bose qc 35 there is no bass so +Point for sony5. Premium look and touch works perfectly fineDislikes1. Expensive but worth it2. Thumping sound is heard when touch is used.
5,"These are much better than Bose QC35-II. In terms of features, noise cancellation, App, Sound, battery backup, these are way ahead.  I do not own the previous  M1 or M2. I have been wanting to get these for a long time. At last, this version is the perfect one and bought it immediately.Pros:Great Sound QualityGreat Noise cancellationGreat features10 Min charge 5 Hrs playbackComfortable and no issues for long hours (At least for 3-4 Hours)As always you've the option to use the regular 3.5MM audio Jack as wired headphonesCarrying CaseUSB Type-CSony Headphones Connect App lets you tweak a lot as per your likesCons:Not good at Calls. You've to talk loud and sometimes your voice gets muffled to the other person who is talking to youNot able to connect 2 devices at once.Gets sweaty or little hot over ears after 3-4 hoursIm getting about 20-25Hrs of backup with ANC on 60% volume."
1,"I have to mention the satisfaction rate for this headphone dropped from absolutely satisfied to absolutely disappointed. Because to begin with I was quite happy with the spot-on features and enigmatic sound quality. However, quite quickly situation changed for the worse and within two months of usage, I‚Äôve started to experience reduced volume on the right side headphone and noise cancellation has gone for a toss and is behaving as if it has a mind of its own, it is producing blurring noises on it‚Äôs own, perhaps in an attempt to cancel ambient noise. On the sound quality front, I wish to mention I am a purist and user of Apple Music, therefore I can safely say when there is some deterioration in the level of sound quality, more often than not, I am able to notice it. These headphones which are positioned by Sony as a market leader for their brand in this product category, has sadly started to produced a crackling sound on moderately high volume, more of a distortion, especially on songs with deep bass frequencies. This is something one may most probably notice on cheaper headphones which can‚Äôt handle a full-band of frequencies at play I believe. To conclude, I am highly regretting my decision of choosing this over the Bose QCIII, I wish I bought that."
1,"Here's an honest review:I read a lot of praise about this product online and decided to go for it. I really tried to like it, but the ANC caused a weird pressure drop inside the earcups. It felt like my eardrums were being sucked out.I feel that the level of comfort one would have with ANC would depend on the strength of their inner ears. It is a great product & ANC works like a charm, but do bear in mind that many users on Reddit have reported feeling nauseous and having ear discomfort on using ANC.No point in spending 29k on a pair of headphones that I would have to spend time and effort getting used to. It may feel normal for others, but ANC isn't for me :("
1,"Overall, no headphone is closer to these in the market .. I used Bose & Sennheiser they might have natural sound but their ANC hurts.. When you wear these with NC on you feel nothing in the brain its just crisp, bassy & noiseless sound.5/5 for being the best in the market ..3/5 for battery life which I feel gets affected after updates & Alexa support ..Durability 3.5/5 why? .. because they are expensive Rs 30k .. you need to be careful while in the bus or train .. as people tend to accidentally fall on you when the moving transport stops also you could hear a popup in the bass when jerk happens .. sony should fix that next time.. happened to me twice & they are not water resistant so be careful in the rain .. always carry the case .. they also feel heavier in comparison to Bose qc 35!!"
5,"Reached before 12pm today on 19th. Awesome delivery service by Amazon and Appario retail.My first NC headphone and in fact  my first over the ear headphone .  Wanted a headphone with ANC so that i can hear good music even at very low volumes. This does achieve that to a large extent.Sound quality and isolation is good even without ANC turned on. What's really commendable is that the audio with the 3.5mm wired connection in the passive mode (i.e with the headphone switched off) was also quiet decent. Do note that with the wired connection you can still switch on the phone and  enable the ANC  but the app however  remains disabled .App works only when the Bluetooth is active .Found some issues  with the app. Since app is just a softwareI hope it would be updated soon  so not reducing any star . When we try to change mode from ""priority on sound quality"" to ""priority on stable connection"" and vice versa then the music stops and doesn't restart. If you want any equaliser changes these are possible only with ""priority on stable connection"". Further many times the app just forgets your last settings of Equalizer or surround sounds and just defaults to native options. Overall the app just doesn't appear premium like the headphones and is buggy. Seems the app development team was taking a nap while the hardware team was burning the midnight night oil. Comfort is good .Don't have any benchmark of BOSE so can't compare. Even tried to lie down with the headphones . Possible  if you use a pillow and want to lie sidewise. You cannot do it on regular basis but the intention was to try to see if it's possible occasionally. So I hope it should help in train journeys for masking loud snores of fellow passengers , khat-khat sound of train and getting good sleep.  When trying to do this test in my home I actually fell asleep :). The can fits into the pocket b/w pillow and the shoulder. Of course it's not a perfect fit ( like  you are not wearing your headphones at all )  but still it was possible by adjusting yourself.The touch controls do tend to get accidentally touched in this case,  say by your biceps or elbow . I hope in future updates Sony gets an option to disable/enable the touch, say by pressing both the power and the ANC button for some time.Touch controls do sometime tend to disobey you but still not a very big issue. The touch control  also responded when I tried to use a thick cloth but somehow  very not predictable.  Tried this to emulate the gloves in winters.The pad foam  do tend to get a little sweaty after around 2hrs and had to take the phones off for a few minutes . Currently the temperature is around 28deg. The phone pad foams should work very well for winters but it appears that in suumers they would tend to get warm and sweaty in case worn for long time. No comparison with Bose so can't compare relatively.ANC is good but for the first time users it does tend to create a in cabin pressure feeling. I however got accustomed to it in few hours. Thankfully there is an option to control the level of ANC.One thing I would like to mention about ANC . I tried testing the ANC with a 1500w mixer grinder and a 2000w vacuum cleaner as well. Don't assume it would mask the sound totally. I could still hear the whine if the motor very well. If you clap your hand you can still hear a thud  but all these sounds with the music on would be muted by 70-80 percent and  won't disturb you. This is just to align your expectations of the ANC. But ANC is still awesome and it would take some time to realise how awesome it is .  I was hearing coldplay at very low volumes with and without ANC , with the water tap on at full speed  ; the difference was phenomenal. And if you like cranked up volumes then of course the ANC would be even more effective.Battery is very good . Even after 3 hours of mixed  listening  on Bluetooth it was showing as 100percent. Sound quality is good and you can customise the equaliser for two of your own choices also . Bass can be tuned very well. I wish the settings got saved in the headphone rather than in the app.The music doesn't stop if you remove your headphones. Thats strange since this feature is present even in lower models like plantronics backbeat pro available,  at 11k.Regarding call quality,  I switched on the vaccum cleaner and made a call to the other party. They never complained about not hearing me. What I have found is that , unlike in some web  reviews, when making calls the ANC does remain active and the ambient noise doesn't  reach your ears or the other  person. May be the software has been tweaked since those reviews.  However it does appear as if you are talking with your ears covered by hand.  So you have  get to get used to that feeling . Overall found the call quality to be decent .If you have a balding head like me the phones tend to slip a bit :( which is just physics  . But hairy heads won't have this issue.Nevertheless I am enjoying it :)"
1,"I have been using Sony 1000MX3 Since Jan 21 2019. There is manufacturing defect as the quality of holding clip highlighted in the pic broke off even after careful use of the headphone within 4 months. I had reported the issue in April 2019 and subsequently visited the Sony service center in Chembur mumbai in May. The service center denied to accept the job work and took photographs to confirm to coverage in warranty. They were suppose to revert back on the status of coverage of warranty but the failed to respond. After couple of months on hassles, I went again to the service center after I getting confirmation from the support center that they will accept the headphones for repair. On JUNE 27th, I have given my headphone to the same service center. Below are the Job details. Its been more than 45 days and I am promised that next week the job will be done as the part is not available in inventory. I want my Money back or a new headphone as replacement as the product is broken due to manufacturing defect of using low quality plastic and thin clip. Horrible Service Quality."
3,1. Noise cancellation is overhyped. Its good but please do not keep very high expectations. It blocks 40 percent of the surrounding noise.2. Sound quality is awesome. Very good bass.3. Sound is not very loud. There should be one or two more level to increase the music volume.3. Touch control works very well.4. They look premium and are light weight.5. Couldn't charge it with OnePlus 6T charger but nokia 8.1 charger worked.6. They are not very comfortable to wear specially if you wear glasses or you have cervical problem.7. Within 10 mins of use you can feel the sweat around your ears. Actually earpads heat up a bit while in use so you cant wear it for long in indian summer.8. My product had a very poor battery life. It last 6 hours after full charge so definitely the battery was poor.9. Warranty card was missing in the packet but packing was good.10. Usb cord provided for charging is of 8 cm length only. I think it is okay. But there is no type c adaptor provided within the box.11. Google Assistant support is awesome and useful.12. Bluetooth connectivity is okay.15. Sony headphone app is user friendly and a must to have.16. Overall I don't recommend this headphone at a cost of rs 30k.
1,"The ProblemIt was about a few months ago that I started noticing a creaky noise from the right side of my¬†WH-1000XM3¬†while listening¬†to some audiobooks during a walk. At first, I ignored the noise as I thought it is due to my adjustments of the headband.I tried everything from removing my glasses to trying the tightest¬†fit to get rid of the noise. To my disappointment,¬†none of it worked.Visiting the service centre [4th July'20]I called in sony customer¬†care who provided me with the phone no. of service centre near me. I reached out to ""iconnect"" in Gurgaon and tried describing my problem¬†to him to which the response¬†was that there is no need to explain to me the problem, just drive down to the service station. Surprised¬†by the¬†utter rudeness of attendant.I still followed the instructions and drove down to the service centre before 5 pm ( as I was instructed).I drove around 15 km to ""iconnect"" sony authorised service centre in Gurgaon. I patiently waited for my turn in an extremely warm service centre( The AC did not function).¬†Interaction with the service centre employeeI started to describe the issue to an unengaged attendant who was still looking at his laptop screen.Me: I have been hearing squeaky¬†noises from the right hinge of my headphones.He: ""Quiky"" without raising his head and continuing to look into his laptop.( As if the word was funny to him)Me: Excuse me!He: Yes, Sir.Me: The right side hinge makes noises even when the headphones are turned off. It is a workmanship defect.He: I haven't heard of such an issue ever.Me: But, it is an issue with my pair of headphones.He: We haven't been informed by Sony of any such issue.Meanwhile, my father started to record this interaction.To which the employee reacted aggressively that you can't record this. ( In an agitated¬†tone)He said I won't serve you if you keep recording and left his counter.My father yielded and put his phone back into his pocket as we drove aa long way, the headphones¬†were expensive and were going out of warranty in a few weeks.Finally, things moved forward, the service centre employee asked one of the technicians to look into the matter. We waited for another 40 mins. Meanwhile, the negative thoughts of getting my headphones messed up and with further damage crossed my mind as this place did not seem or operated¬†professionally¬†The Technician arrives with his analysis.The Technician: I have checked the circuitry¬†and problem is not stemming from the electricals but is of mechanical in nature. I facepalmed myself and said to myself ""Exactly what I described, Why did you open my headphones""Next steps. The attendant spoke to a Sony employee and described him the problem over the phone & finally created a job sheet saying with the problem described as "" Abnormal noise from the right hinge even when the device is switched off""I asked him, what are the next steps, he said that he would let me know my Tuesday i.e 7th July'20 after he sends a video of this issue to the Sony Official. ( I am not too sure is the sound could be captured in a video effectively)Current status: I am patiently waiting for any update with the fear that I would be returned my old headphones which have now been open by not so professional service centre and might be prone to malfunction and since the warranty is near its end I might have to live with a product is further messed by the service centre.Update: 7th July 20The day I was promised that I would get to know what is the status of my service request.3 Sony call centre calls - Have committed me they have¬†forwarded¬†my concern to the service centre.5 calls to the service station- Either the some of the phones provided are always busy or out of service.I have no idea what is the status of my service request.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After calling the service centre for the 10th time they have finally replied that the headphones have been repaired and I can collect it.¬†Which was informed to be non - repairable defect at the day of the first visit.The situation has gone bad to worse. Kindly help. I feel that I have been ripped off of my money by making this purchase decision.¬†My request to SonyI have been a Sony customer & Fan for long, I remember our First coloured TV was a made in Japan Sony TV, which was a matter¬†of pride for the entire family, Second was the iconic Walkman, then the flat screen Sony Wega ( I remember¬†being mesmerised by picture quality I saw at the store), Sony Xperia U,¬†Sony SRS-ZR7 and the latest¬†WH-1000XM3.I believe the quality of service is the weakest link for Sony in India and this experience would deter me to move ahead or recommend Sony products to my friends and family with confidence. Kindly take this feedback and reflect on what kind of feelings do you want to invoke when a person hears the name ""Sony"". Should it invoke the feeling confidence & high quality that arises from its Japanese origins or the brand with¬†terrible service?Buyer Beware."
5,"Awesome pair of headphones. I tried Bose QC 35 before buying this beast. I want to say that anyone can buy it without even a second thought. Sound quality, Battery life is superior compared to Bose. Confort is same on both. I have weard this headphones for more than 5 hours without any problems. Battery last for more than 30hrs if we turn off noise cancellation. Sound quality is great and it gives that punchy bass which people like me loves most on Sony headphones. Also we can adjust sound using the given equalizer on App.I have noted couple of points during my usage1. We cannot connect multiple devices at same time, which is a biggest thumbs down. We need to manually reconnect devices each time. I think Sony can change this behavior using a software update.2. We cannot use One plus fast charger to charge this headphones even the Sony manual says we can use any charger whose current output is greater than 1.5A. The recommended charger output range is 1A-2.5A, which I confirmed with Sony. So I am charging it with my flipkart Smartbuy charger.3. To get LDAC sound quality, we need to change one option in Sony headphone app, where we can select maximum Sound quality or stable connection. There we need to select Sound quality. If your smartphone supports LDAC, it will automatically switch to LDAC mode."
4,"Who are these for?Casual listeners will love the Sony WH-1000XM3, as it offers a huge boost in sound quality over general consumer headphones when used with Bluetooth. Commuters will appreciate the excellent noise cancellation offered by these headphones, best in the market.Very rarely will I say that a set of headphones is for ‚Äúeveryone,‚Äù but active noise cancelers that are comfortable and sound as good as the Sony WH-1000XM3 fall into that category.They perform well on commutes, flights, and just out on the town. Generally, these are headphones for everywhere but the computer‚Ä¶ and even then they‚Äôre not bad if you‚Äôre not deep into the lossless audio game.Despite being largely identical in many ways to the older Sony WH-1000XM2, a few upgrades have made the brand-new WH-1000XM3 a better buy for the long haul. For example, the ear pads are deeper, and the addition of USB-C charging.I‚Äôm not sure that these tweaks are completely worth upgrading for if you already own last year‚Äôs model, but if you‚Äôre buying a new set of headphones: these go a long way to setting Sony‚Äôs offerings apart from Bose, Sennheiser, and AKG.Probably the best thing about the headphones is that you rarely ever need to use your phone to control your music. Once you‚Äôve got the headphone app installed, you can easily navigate playback with swipes of your finger (forward, backward swipes), adjust the volume by swiping up or down, and activate your voice assistant with a long press. Initially, that assistant was limited only to the default one on your phone but the company has recently announced an update to the headphones that will give them full compatibility with Amazon Alexa as well. All you have to do is update through the Sony Headphone Connect app on your smartphone and you can choose whichever virtual assistant you want‚Äîdepending on what smart products you have in your house, or simply which one answers your questions better. Additionally, you can temporarily hear the world around you by cupping your hand over the right ear cup, which makes the headphones use their external microphones to pass your surroundings on to your ears. This is great for when someone needs to tell you something, or for plane announcements.Are the Sony WH-1000XM3 well built?The chassis of the WH-1000XM3 is the same hard plastic as its predecessor, though there isn‚Äôt any fake plastic leather over the ear cups anymore. Instead, it‚Äôs now a soft-touch material that your fingers can easily glide over. At the top of each ear cup are two wide microphones that collect data for the noise-cancelling unit to destroy outside sound.Battery life-Battery life is great on the Sony WH-1000XM3, lasting 24 hours of constant 75dB playback‚Ä¶ with maximum ANC running. This is an absolutely stellar result and should keep you protected from the outside world for long trips.How do the Sony WH-1000XM3 sound?Great, really. We‚Äôve come to a point in wireless headphones that most of the big gripes are gone, replaced by minor ones. For the Sony WH-1000XM3, the sound is quite good, bolstered by the fact that they target a very consumer-friendly sound by default. The main takeaway here is that the headphones target a consumer sound, with emphasized bass, a little bump in the mids, and a peek at about 10kHz.It isn‚Äôt for audiophiles looking for lossless listening, so I feel like I owe you an explanation. Sony‚Äôs headphones really are best in class here, but they‚Äôre not perfect. The LDAC codec is certainly impressive by many metrics, but only when you can get the 660 or 990kbps modes. Weirdly enough, the 330kbps default connection is worse than SBC in some ways, so you may find you should dive into the developer options in your phone to lock the WH-1000XM3 into 660kbps just to be sure you‚Äôre getting the best of what your headphones have to offer. The 990kbps mode may be tempting, but for me, 660 is a great middle-ground that still exceeds my hearing capabilities.BassBass is heavily emphasized in the LDAC and default SBC modes, but you can change this by using Sony‚Äôs app if you wish. However, you may elect to keep things as they are to really feel the bass in recordings that underplay it a bit. You may find that engine noise masks a bit of the bassline and bongo thumps to the one and only recognized version of September.Mids and HighsMids take a bit of a backseat to the bass if you use the stock LDAC connection without swapping off to equalize your music. You may want to turn the bass down a bit if you‚Äôre jamming out to old Queen records.Is the Sony WH-1000XM3‚Äôs mic any good?Usually, microphones are pretty terrible on headphones, but the Sony WH-1000XM3 is the exception to the rule. While the nature of transmitting audio still means that quiet sounds might get amplified in order to mask shortcomings of the power situation, the actual technical capabilities of the microphone are quite‚Ä¶ okay. However, it doesn‚Äôt combat the proximity effect very well, so your voice will sound bassier than it usually might.I will mention that the microphone doesn‚Äôt do so well with outside noise rejection, nor does it mitigate something called the ‚Äúproximity effect.‚Äù If you have a super bassy voice like mine, you may find that phone calls are a little annoying with these headphones.Should you buy the Sony WH-1000XM3?A gadget that costs Rs. 24000 might sound like it‚Äôs too expensive, but it‚Äôs really not for all that it gives you in return. A really good set of active noise-cancelling headphones is worth its weight in gold, and the Sony WH-1000XM3 is among the best out there. Newer headphones offer some interesting ANC features like the Jabra Elite 85h, but only the Shure Aonic 50 goes toe-to-toe with the raw ANC power of the WH-1000XM3. Even if it‚Äôs not technically very different than its predecessor, that‚Äôs okay: all the WH-1000XM2 needed to be truly great headphones were a USB-C charging port and deeper ear pads‚Ä¶ which the WH-1000XM3 provide.Active noise cancelers are the rare headphones that work well in just about any situation, and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre so valuable. You‚Äôre not going to enjoy listening with high-end open-back headphones on the subway, after all. The Sony WH-1000XM3 are the perfect travel buddies with great battery life, solid sound, and a price point under its main competitors.Additionally, you may want to wait for the Sony WH-1000XM4 to hit the shelves, as they‚Äôre coming out soon (allegedly). When that happens, you‚Äôll have the option of grabbing the WH-1000XM3‚Äôs replacements or grabbing these headphones at a substantial discount.Pros and cons:-Pro: Solid DesignPro: Alexa EnabledPro: Solid Battery LifePro: Deeper BassCon: Plastic HeadbandCon: High Price.If you found this review to be useful, do mark it as helpful.Cheers!"
1,These are only good for noise cancellationi sent it back coz of following issues1.the ear pad cushion had lot of wrinkles and looked old2. the touch buttons are very sensitive and get pressed accidentally a lot.. even when lying down if it touches the pillow and often if your chin will touch the left side nc button the nc switches off3. noise cancelling was not holding and went off automatic after few mins4.during call there was echo and the voice gets amplified a lot and nc didnt work during callsso returned and bought bose qc35 2 and they are much better with physical buttons which doesnt get pressed automatically and noise cancellation is superb and works during call.
5,"I have Audio Technica ATH M50x and Sennheiser HD598 headphones that I've been using for the past 4 years. I also have Yamaha HS5 studio monitors. These are the baseline of comparison for me. I'd never wanted to buy another headphones for myself as I was already set with the two headphones (1 open back and 1 closed back) and a pair of excellent near field studio monitors for my recording deck. But one day my brother got these and was listening to them. I casually tried them on and was blown away by the noise cancellation prowess of these pair. And also was thoroughly impressed by the freedom wireless headphones offered. I was always of the opinion that wired headphone's sound quality could never be matched by a wireless headphones. It's true but these come pretty damn close!Things I absolutely love about the headphones are;1. Noise Cancellation is wonderful!. Whatever happens around you is barely audible as soon as you put these on. It may be weird at first but you get used to the active noise cancellation. And once the music starts playing, you're completely isolated in your own world. Nothing comes through once you put these on. I just totally love that about these headphones.2. Sound Quality: Now this is subjective. There are certain aspects of sound that I like in each of my headphones. On my M50x I like the analytical sound and I like that I can pick up anything and everything. But it gets a little too shrill and piercing because it's treble is too powerful and can be very very fatiguing. As for my HD598, being open back, they have good sound stage and they have the sennheiser veil. They are warm and almost flat. For laid back music listening they are wonderful and you can listen to them for 8 to 10 hours without any discomfort!. As for these, they are the best of both the worlds. The highs are clear and you can pick out the details in all the songs. The bass is wonderfully tight and strong. I've not seen such bass either in M50x or HD598. And I just love it. Even though I prefer the flat sound signature of HD598, I still like the slightly accentuated bass in these cans.3. The convenience: This was what pushed me to purchase. I can't believe how angry I got when every manufacturer in the world started removing the 3.5 mm Headphone jack. I wowed to never buy phones without headphone jack and also mentally became judgmental about wireless headphones. But after seeing my brother's Sony WH-1000XM3s I understood what I was missing out on. It's the convenience.... Not the sound quality or comfort or anything else that gets to you. I now use the headphones more often. So, essentially I'm getting more out of the money I spent on these. (And these are not cheap!). Battery life seems to be as advertised. I used these cans for almost 10 hours straight for the first 3 days and then had to charge them. These charge up in about half hour. Very nice feature.What I dislike....1. Comfort: I have large ears. Even though the cups are large enough that my big ears fit in them, they are not deep enough. After about an hour my ears start getting pinched and I have to adjust them or remove them for 1 or 2 minutes. Curiously enough, this only happens on the right earcup. Either my right earlobe is disproportionately large or the headphone cup is heavier on right side because of battery, because I've noticed that when you charge the headphones, the right earcup heats up. So either the charging circuit is there or the battery is. Whatever it might be, comfort is not as good as the sennheiser. I wouldn't even compare these with M50x on comfort because M50x suck at comfort! These are far better than M50x in comfort and a little worse than sennheiser HD598.2. Mids: As mentioned previously, I like flat sound signature, and these cans have recessed mids. The voices and instruments in the vocal range (like woodwinds) sound muted on these cans. Whereas on Sennheiser HD598 they are crystal clear. Perhaps my ears need to get used to the sound signature or have become accoustomed to flat sounding headphones. Whatever the case might be, mids are lower than bass and treble sounds in these cans. This doesn't take away from the musicality of the headphones though. The tracks sound wonderfully nice on these. You just need to turn up the volume to hear the voices (which in turn makes the instruments louder as well!) The male voices get muted a little. but female voices sound alright.In terms of sound quality considering my tastesSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.8/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9.6/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 9.4/10Yamaha HS5 --- 9.8/10 (you can hear everything in these :-)ComfortSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.5/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 6/10Yamaha HS5 --- 10/10 (you don't need to wear them)Portability/Convenience. This should be your deciding factor to buy them or not.Sony WH-1000XM3 --- 10/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 7/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 7/10Yamaha HS5 --- 0/10 (these weigh 20 kgs and need wires and a sound card to run)Other considerations1. Call quality is decent over the phone but doesn't do well with Whatsapp video call or google hangouts or Cisco Webex (Yes I used these for meetings just to see how good the microphones were. It turns out that direct calls are fine but anything else and they fall apart).2. Controls: They are a little finicky. I'd have liked physical buttons that have a certainty to them. Here you're sometimes not sure if your action has been registered. Also when your fingers are sweaty, they don't slide as easily as you'd like them to. This causes noise due to finger dragging with friction over the control surface.Overall, I'd recommend this to everyone who wants to isolate themselves from the outside world. These are very good at that. But for pure sound quality or absolute comfort, I'd still recommend wired headphones like Sennheiser HD598. The problem with wireless headphones is that the technology (bluetooth) is still advancing and it might be 5 more years until it catches up to the quality of wired headphones. Then wireless headphones will fully take over the wired headphones market because only in sound quality department wireless headphones are lacking right now. The technology of wired headphones has come to its peak. There's nothing more to be done in that. The future is indeed wireless headphones with active noise cancellation. There's a lot to be done in this aspect. These technologies are still nascent. There's lot of scope of improvement in terms of pairing ease, bandwidth of bluetooth connection, battery life and noise cancellation algorithms.These are for people who travel a lot and need sound isolation to enjoy music. These are for people who like convenience over absolute sound quality. Bluetooth technology hasn't yet caught up with the wired headphone sound quality. But it will soon. These headphones are almost there.I wrote this review because no one has been comparing wireless headphones with wired ones. I hope it helps someone who is deciding to get a new phone that doesn't have a headphone jack. If you value absolute sound quality, don't get a phone without headphone jack. The wired headphones still offer better value and sound quality but at the expense of convenience."
2,"It has a lot going for it. But there are many niggling problems that make it frustrating to use and make you feel that perhaps this product wasn't tested properly before release.Cons:1. Ears heat up and causes sweating.2. The sounds isn't balanced. In Ambient noise cancelling mode, the balance is more to the left wherein the left ear cup gives you more bass gain. It gives you that feeling of the right side not working properly.In passive (non-ambient sound) mode, the gain is more to the right ear cup. What kind of a joke is this? This issue is not very prominent but you'll notice it. And once you do, you just feel like dumping these cans. You don't have this kind of a problem even with headphones that cost $10. Unbelievable.3. Can't pair with more than one device.4. Doesn't pair with a bluetooth dongle which I connected to my TV.5. Mic is pathetic. You wouldn't want to make calls with these. Forget about it.Pros:1. ANC is pretty good. Does a great job with white noise. But keep your expectations in check. Also, it doesn't keep out voices.2. App. The sound profile is bass heavy in its natural state but you can use the app to tweak it to your liking.3. Touch controls are a great idea. Don't work in the cold apparently.4. I find it convenient to plug and play these using audio cable. So this way I don't need to pair every time.5. USB Type C.6. Battery life is excellent.7. Ambient sound feature is a great idea and works well.They were somewhat over my budget but I still got them because they are Sony. But I feel let down by Sony. Could a software upgrade fix these issues? Will have to wait and see. The mic is a hardware issue so that's not getting fixed ever. This is further proof that you shouldn't listen to reviewers. All they care about is getting a review out ASAP for views.So overall, I wouldn't suggest you to buy these. I personally regret buying them. Spend your hard earned money somewhere else."
1,"Static noise in right earphone with ANC on. Second day of use. Got to know the problem is quite common. Sony service center after getting all details said the piece is defective.Unable to return as Amazon customer care call agents are not responding.. Putting the call on endless hold... By design I guess.Too expensive a headset to have such a problem. Windy static like noise. Goes away with ANC turned off. But we are paying here mainly for the ANC.Got the replacement headphones. Working fine till now.Update.  After five days of use the replacement headphone too had started giving out random white noise ( cracking noise) in noise isolation mode. Though less than the previous set, it may only get worse with time."
1,"It's good if you are using it just as headphone, but I am using with my Samsung S9+, and listen to music and if a call comes in between, people can not hear me, I have to disconnect Bluetooth and take the call. it's not worth this money and now the return window is over, I can not give it back, don't know what to do?"
1,Sound Quality Isn't Good As I Was Expecting.......Clear Vocals.....? NOClear Bass......? NOBeats.....? Not ClearReally I'm Not Satisfied With This PairBattery Backup Is 10 HoursI'm Using Sennheiser Momentum And Sennheiser Is Much Better Than ThisRegretting Now....... I've Placed A Request For Replacement...... Let's See What Will Happenüòí
5,"I will keep it concise1. Active Noise Cancellation - Sony has pushed the boundaries of noise cancellation a notch above Bose QC35II.Tried this out in flight sitting near the engine, with the NC turned on and it felt i was at home, the engine white noise was totally nullified along with the voice of the crowd which was reduce to a mumble.2. Sound - Not as neutral as Bose but has more punchy bass and lively mids. another pros is about this headphones are. is it has a equalizer options via the sony headphone connect app which lets to change the sound according to your taste.Bose will not let you do that.3. Battery life - on paper its written 30hrs. Took a 5.5hrs flight and was using the headphones for more  7hrs straight, i got a drop of 20% on battery from 100%-80%.lasted much more than 30hrs when i used it for the first time.4. Comfort - The leather used is of highest quality and you can wear it non stop for more than 5 hrs straight without your ears getting fatigued.5- Smart features to allow ambient sounds in the headphones while walking and option to increase the focus on Voice with the headphone kept on.if you are looking for ANC headphones, it has to be WH1000XM3"
4,"These are an excellent pair of headphones with a good, balanced soundstage and crisp, clear highs. There is no point harping about the best in class noise cancellation as that has been well covered by many reviewers. Instead, I would like to discuss some practical advantages of these headphones above even the newer Sony 1000XM4 and many other headphones which I personally believe are not as good a buy as these ones, especially if you can find them for sale at around 16k.Pros:1. Excellent soundstage with deep lows and rich bass, and clear highs2. Best noise cancellation3. Easy on the ears and can be worn for a long time without discomfort (a big plus over many other 'premium' brands including Shure and Bose.4. And this is the most important point - it supports all the codecs your phone and laptop currently support (LDAC, Aptx HD, Aptx, AAC, SBC) which NO OTHER pair of headphones support in this price range OR higher! This means that you can never get this much versatility in any other comparable pair of headphones noe even it's successor the 1000XM4. Now, everyone knows that LDAC is notoriously known for dropping sound quality at 'less than ideal' conditions, a problem that Aptx HD doesn't have, so you can switch codecs whenever needed to maintain the best sound quality as well.5. Comes with airplane adapter (ideal for regular fliers (especially during the pandemic)Cons:Nothing to write about. If I had to be picky, I would say the fact that it cannot connect to two devices simultaneously is a con but as I do not need to do so it does not really affect me.At this price point, with almost similar specs and sound as it's successor the 1000XM4, these are easily the most versatile pair of headphones that offer this level of sound quality and features at this price point. 'nuff said.Tip: For best sound setup after purchase, use the Sony headphones app ear setup section to ensure the best sound for YOUR ears. It does make a difference."
2,"[6 months update]So the side clips came out on their own. Upon reaching SONY service to repair them , since its still under warranty,  they flat out refused and asked me to pay 4k for headband replacement. It's a shame that such an amazing product has got such pathetic customer support. Even after I was ready to pay , then I came to know, the part is not available in Kolkata, rather the entire casing is available @16k.[8 months update]After repeated emails to Sony Support, that made the headband spare part available and gave it to me @5k price. I got my headphone repaired and I can now use it daily. At-least that made it available @Kolkata and within semi-reasonable price. Increased rating to 2 stars for this.Verdict: Go with Bose, at-least you'll get good support.I bought this product in Amazon Festive sale 2019 with the sole purpose of using in office to block office chatter and noise. I tested for a day in office, here is my verdict.Noise Cancellation: (NOTE: I don't play songs while in office because its distracting, just the ANC is on)Good enough to be used in office with a few caveats:1. If there is a sound directed towards your microphone from short distance (office phone/laughter, someone talking right behind/beside/facing you), you can hear it at 90% volume.2. Other low frequency office noise like Equipment/engine noise but not human vocals(which is not specifically directed towards your microphone) is reduced to 10% of their original volume depending on distance . This helps you to focus.3. Office chatter (voice) happening at some distance (6ft or more) are reduced to 30% volume, so you can effectively ignore them.4. During the call, noise cancellation does not work, which is annoying. Otherwise the call quality is itself very clear with no issues.That being said, if you play music in even 20% of the volume, you can't hear anything outside (Practically 0). That helps in focus while working, but I personally can't focus while good is playing(in my mind, I'm dancing :P)Sound Quality:I didn't buy this device for sound quality, but trust me, the sound quality will blow your mind, its the best I've heard till now. I streamed Master Quality Audio (from Tidal) via wired connection, and the sound clarity, depth and accuracy is superb. You'll truly immerse yourself in audio if you stream High fidelity music via wired connection.Battery /Comfort / Build Quality:These are industry standard as expected from SONY. Anyone with SONY headphones knows that."
1,I bought this headphone 15 days back and I have already started hearing buzzing crackling noise when the music is not being played and ANC is on. There is no noise when I just wear them (ANC is off) but as soon as I switch it on it start making this koise when you are not listening tk anything. I never paid attention initially but yeah now I regret.Having used just for 5-6 times in this period this is a worst thing that could have happened to my 25k bucks. After searching for this online it seems like it's a manufacturing fault and there ain't any solution for it.
5,"using this from last 3 days.Pros:1>Awesome Noise canceling. on it and get isolated from neighbors.2>if your phone or TV supports LDAC or aptx-hd ,than you really enjoy the quality of sound.USe SBC mode with DSEE-X with VPT on mode. thats also good. bt LDAC mode gives to better depth of bass and treble.3>battery life is just awesome, used around 10 hours and still, 76% battery is available.4> My brother is having Bose QC 35II, but apart from noise cancellation and better Bass handling, nothing is too great.so if you have Bose QC35ii , no need to upgrade.Cons: Call quality at noisy place , not too much clear. sometimes it just surrounding within my ear only. but at quiet place , it's  good as expected.Overall:  worth to purchase if you have Sony TV , and Phones having with LDAC and APT-X HD support."
5,"Before I start with the review, let me make it clear that my tryst with noise cancellation headphones began in 2012 with the humble yet impressive Nokia BH-905 which I purchased for around 300 USD. My desire for good headphones started in the year 2008 with the wired Bose headphones and another Bose headphone a few years later. I am the proud owner of the Sennheiser PXC 550 for the past 3 years and have used it extensively to the extent that the leatherette coating has worn out beyond salvation.Although I do not claim myself to be an audiophile, I will do my best to review the Sony WH-1000XM3 to the best of my ability. This review will also compare the 1000 XM3 to the PXC 550.Packaging :-------------The headphones arrived in a decent box. The build quality of the box could be improved. The PXC 550 were packed in a much better built box. The product is made in Malaysia.Carrying case :-----------------The carrying case, although hard, is of average quality. The PXC 550 has a softer case in comparison. None of them come even closer to the immaculate carrying case which was provided with the Nokia BH-905 in 2012 !!!Build quality :----------------The 1000XM3 is pretty robust. I did not find much difference when compared to PXC 550. The main difference is that the earcups have a free sideways movement and no hard clicks. There could be confusion as to which one is left ear and which one is right. It will take some time to make peace with the fact that the left earcup has an NFC symbol on it.Ergonomics :---------------While I was used to the PXC 550 with all the buttons on its right side, the 1000 XM3 is in sharp contrast with the buttons on its left side. There is a multifunction button and a power button. The touch pad is located on the right side. There is a USB C charging port on the right side ( the updated PXC 550 still has a micro usb port )The head band is of decent quality and I did not face any trouble wearing the headphones.The earcups when compared to the PXC 550 are a tad uncomfortable to wear. While it is a known fact that around ear noise cancellation headphones will make your ears sweat after say, 2 hours of usage, I felt more comfortable with the PXC 550. Also the 1000 XM3 has an additional cushioning in front of the sound driver which is bound to  touch the ear pinna and cause you some irritation until such time that you get used to wearing the headphones.The headphones will definitely make your ears sweat. Period.So don't buy these headphones (or any around ear noise cancellation headphones for that matter ) to complain that the ears sweat !!!Noise cancellation :----------------------The 1000XM3 beats the competition upfront when it comes to noise cancellation. There is a feature to calibrate the noise cancellation and optimize it as per the situation, The multifunction button toggles between normal mode, ambience mode and noise cancellation mode. There is a feature where the noise cancellation levels can be adjusted for sitting, walking, running and transport. If ambient sound control is switched on, this feature will automatically adjust the noise cancellation levels as set by the user.Those who keep complaining about some ear pressure, please note that this is the basis on which noise cancellation works and hence there is bound to be some discomfort when noise cancellation is active. Take this from a person who has been regularly using noise cancelling headphones for the past 8 years.Sound quality :-----------------I never bothered to ponder over the sound quality when using the PXC 550 as I trusted a 30k headphone to sound well. But when I got my hands on the 1000 XM3, I did an upfront comparison between the two and I found out that the 1000 XM3 definitely sound better (by a small margin) than the PXC 550. Some rogue reviews mentioned that Sony has more bass than the others. I disagree with this statement. The 1000 XM3 has a punchier sound than the PXC 550 and hence one gets a feeling of more bass in comparison. On a lighter note, there is an option to increase bass levels using the software if the headphones aren't doing enough already !!!Connectivity :----------------Found no issues with connectivity. When compared to the PXC 550, the Bluetooth signal was just about the same strength, although the PXC 550 are a bit better. I tried out the headphones with a windows 10 laptop as well and found no issues. The headphones worked fine with my iPad air.The wired connection worked without any issues.The NFC function also worked fine.Touchpad :-------------The touch pad does a pretty decent job. But when I compare to the PXC 550, I felt that the 1000 XM3 has a slower response although it should not be much of a bother.On a positive note, there is a feature of lowering the music volume by just touching the touchpad with the palm. This feature is very useful when you want to listen to somebody without removing the headphones.Battery life :--------------The claimed battery life is 30 hours under test conditions. I did not bother to break my head over the number of hours I got with a single charge.Software :------------This is one factor where the 1000 XM3 outperform the PXC 550 by a big margin. The Sennheiser software was just a gimmick where the user could not do much than check the battery level of the headphones and a few other settings. The Sony software is very detailed with numerous settings and you can really control your headphones using the software. The headphone firmware was updated when I first connected them using the software. Beware that the update takes around 45 minutes to complete and you need to be patient.Conclusion :--------------For 19.3k during the Prime day sale, I am more than happy with these headphones. I did have an option to buy the updated PXC 550 or the Bose QC 35, but I chose to go ahead with Sony.One common issue with any premium headphone is the availability of replacement ear cushions and I still haven't been able to get one for my PXC 550. It is relatively easier to get one for the QC 35 and I hope that I don't have to beat around the bush much to get a replacement cushion for the 1000 XM3 in the near future."
1,"A person has already written about this cracking noise issue and his bad experience with this product . Even after I had read it , I purchased the product because of other positive reviews . It's a big mistake . Within 5 days , the crackling noise started from both sides . So the product was replaced by Amazon . But the replaced product was worse than the first one . Crackling noise started on the first day itself. So I returned the product and applied for a refund . Sony has to address this issue and make a fix . Thank you"
2,"Headphones don't cancel the human voice at all though they are very good (not great) at canceling the other noises. The reason for me to buy is to avoid distraction in office but I was able to hear the peoples voice clearly. I had to return my first pair thinking that there was some issue, but there was no change in ANC performance with new headphones. I don't think these are worth it for the price they charge. I bought these based on the Sony commercial ads and few reviews, but I was utterly disappointed with the ANC performance in canceling human voice. Not sure if this has got something to do with the new firmware 4.1.1 because I got headphones with 4.1.1 by default.I need to appreciate the seller Appario Retail Private Ltd for accepting the return and refunding the amount though the product falls under only replacement category."
5,This is a 30 day review from my side so if you are really planning to buy this product please read this review entirely so that you are clear about your choice.....So I ordered this product and recieved it the other day...superfast delivery....then I unboxed the product...the packing can be rated 4 stars...the headphones look damn good and are very much comfy..sound quality is also good but a little lower than the best...and battery life is amazing...I charged it once fully and I was able to use it for 2 weeks straight at probably 2 hours a day...battery life is best...sound quality is good... comfortable and durable...best product in this range....and don't forget BASS quality is the best...note this is 30 day review so it is very accurate...
2,"about a year after purchase first the battery stopped charging so bluetooth feature couldn't be used, and soon after that the ear protective pads fell offwaste of money"
1,"Made it China! Warranty is just on paper,they don't seem to work in reality.Sound quality is kinda ok but deteriorates after 6 months of usage and that causes headache.The synthetic layer of the cushion isn't of good quality.Bluetooth range is good and battery works fine.Spend a little more and go for good brands."
5,"Its one of the best headphones for this price( i bought it for 2k). It has super powerful bass and clear sound quality. It can be used either using Bluetooth or it can be wired. It is compatible for Android, ios and for PC or laptops. This headphone is for serious music lovers who love extra bass and it is also good for watching movies or for gaming. It has many buttons so i don't have to take my phone at all. Finally i would suggest people to buy this rather than buying boAt rockerz 400."
4,"So allow me write a very technical and accurate review about the amazing Boat 510.Amazon was as usual on time and excellent with the delivery of the product.Now the thing about the headphones isThey work extremely fine while on Bluetooth.I have tried with my pc and some mobiles the sound quality is uncompromised even during the low volume. The bass is very noticeable.As soon ass you plug in the jack in your device, the bass is lost/reduced. The headphones will start sounding flat. With only the highs and mids, no lows. I think Boat should work on this particular aspect.Otherwise the headphones are amazing.Must buy for daily use.But if you're a person who's producing music or working with sounds much more professionally I would recommend to try try Boat 600 or higher.Thankyou."
3,"Well if you're looking for a decent gaming headphones that this product is not the one you're looking for.so straight to pros and cons:Pros-1.  these have a premium look.2. cushioning is good.3. Bass is good.4. Battery is also good(upto 7-8 hrs).5- decent headphones in this price range (i got these for 1500 rs).cons-1. these are not flexible.2. bass is good but you can't listen to melody songs, these headphones adds bass to them too. you'll get bass in almost every song so you have to use equalizers to avoid that.3. this is the most annoying problem i found in this product ,actually this is the problem that comes in almost every bt headphones(so basically if you are looking for gaming headphones don't go for BT headphonesreason:- it uses dual profile system in 1st profile you can use stereo with good sound but you can't use mic and in 2nd profile you can use mic but sound quality changes to mono and you'll have an awful experience with that.)"
1,"First of all, the after sale service is very very poor, I've an issue with the headset,i filed a complaint on their website, the sales guy took the headset & i didn't get any information from Boat rockerz about my headset & still i don't know where it is.So, please be careful with thisAnd rest sound quality is good, battery life is poor & major issue in Bluetooth button."
5,"I got it for 1300 after many discounts....Seriously, these are the best if you want in below 2k range...People who say these are bad might have gotten a bad piece which they can exchange within 10 days with replacement guarantee and the other category people who are fans of Good Treble can stay away from these, these are for people who love that extra bass... These are the ones who are giving negative reviews to this piece of beauty..üòÅI say go ahead and order this piece of music weapon if you are a true fan of bass.."
5,Now I don't know much about bass and treble and such stuff but these headphones are pretty good. I can charge then for 2 hours and they work for 6-7 hours which is pretty good. The sound quality is decent and the range is great. I mainly use it in the gym and the ear buds gets a bit sweaty which I find uncomfortable but you can easily wipe the sweat off. They're pretty stable when working out and don't shake very easily or fall off.
5,"It's really a value for money product. But in the sale of Amazon it's looking costly compared to other as Flipcart. In great Indian festival its lowest price is ‚Çπ1,849/- but in Flipcart big billion days its lowest price is only ‚Çπ1,499/- . It's the difference."
5,Sound quality - excellent 10/10Battery life - excellent 10/10Durability - excellent 9.5/10This is the best headphone and i am sure that it gives top quality sound in the low budget and it can surely beat JBL....Go for it and buy!Note :- my phone is having dolby atmos music service and the sound quality may differ on your use of the headphone.
1,"They crush the ears. wearing them for about an hour is an ordeal. Sound quality is not what it is expected to be. Drums get lost somewhere. noise cancellation, though passive, is OK. but the discomfort offered on the ear overshadows every single positive they may have."
1,"Hi Team,Its a very cheap quality product.As in 30 days its damaged, battery dead, Bluetooth properly not working. Now somebody please tell what i have to do with this cheap headphone.Now i can't returned it as i m out of india.. Please don't buy this product.. Its a humble request. I need to highlight this issue in  social media."
1,"First lets talk abhout sound quality its not good at all, high quality sounds start to cracle and this headset said it has 'extraaaaaaaaa powerful bass' what exactly written on the box literally this headset has zero bass just flat sound, don't get me wrong it has some bass to it but that type of bass also given by Rs. 50 earphones, these headset start to vibrate like hell on full volume some people said on review you can get best bass on full volume but by doing that your partner can also experience the music , cheap plastic used seems like it will get broken just in one fall. Yes it has some good points too, it has good Bluetooth range. If that is the reason to buy it. No correct indicator for its battery. My earphones are much better then this. If you want... Their name is QKZ Just search for them."
5,I have been using using since 2 Years .... still battery is not drained out !! sound Quality is above standard and impressive. Material and Look is Good !! Liked this product. feeling very little pressure on ear but if you want noise cancellation then you have to manage this. overall this is very good product. Nothing can beat it !!
1,"First, this is On Ear headphones and not Over the Ear. Product description is totally wrong.Second, when you increase the volume above 55%, your neighbor can hear everything.Third, Bluetooth compatibility is not that great  when connected with Laptop.You Ears will start paining after 5 mints use."
5,Long battery life.but fitment loose
5,"I took my time to write this review. Didn't really want to rush. And i must say this is one really good product. Sound quality is good, given its very reasonable price. The bass is cool. I checked the sound fidelity using a few YouTube videos that test for the range of frequencies a headphone can handle and reproduce ...i must say this headphone has done extremely well in those audio tests. The setup is ultra easy..i also make conference calls with this headphone (WebEx)..and i have confirmed from the other side..that the mic quality is also good.The only thing I can't yet comment is the durability..as i have used it only for a month..and it has been good so far...Verdict :  go for it. Good one to have. The viper green colour is really awesome...no wonder i was charged additional bucks to purchase it. I have a total of 3 of this headphone pairs..."
1,"A size of headphone is too big... Sound coming outside, plastic head handle... Easily damage"
4,"Pros ...On full volume , bass is commendable . Battery life is cool ...Although I used 3 -4 times for short periods it's been 36 hrs and battery remains untouched ...Same as it was at the time of delivery (90*/*)Product has a comfortable neck cushion which provides thickness to the product , comfort to neck , and durability . ITS easy to connect , use and play ur vibe in attractive look with flamy red colour . The bluetooth compatibility range is around 10m which is more than enough ..After that glitch in sound can be heard.Cons....The thing which disappointed me was the volume decrease button , which didn't worked . But still Not a great problem , Mobile phone may help ."
4,Hi i am writing this review to tell you guys that these headphones are infact great. It got the value for thw money. But i am having a problem i am hoping if someone could explain it to me. Whenever i charge and i put the plug on there is the red light on the headphones which i assume is indicating charging but it goes off in 5 mins and i have to keep plugging it again and again but still it the red light turns off. So how do i know if my headphones are changing or not?
5,The product is too good. Quality bass. Durability is also amazing. I would consider to buy. Simple to operate. Bluetooth connectivity and Aux connectivity available which fulfills both the needs that is what I liked the most.
5,Got these in sale for just rs 1500 only. I thought that these are just like the normal Bluetooth headphones... I've test these with my one plus 6 and really im amazed with the bass it provides...but dont get me wrong...the bass is like slightly better than any of the headphones in the same price segment.... although i recommend it completely...because BoAt didn't compromised with the sound quality and bass deepness with these ones!!
3,"I am giving 3-Star only for the Sound Quality. i'll go directly on Pro's and concernPro's:1) Sound Quality for the price range is very good.2) Bluetooth connection is good. U can connect your laptop and Mobile at a time. So it's a multi-connection.3) Battery Backup is very good for the price range headphone's, I am getting more than 10++ hour's backup for one charge.(At least I have watched 5 to 6 movies in one charge).Con's:1) Worst design or Plastic quality.(I have replaced an item due to some bad noice/Sound like something left inside the  headphone not fixing properly).2) After sometime's(30 to 45min) of continues use you'll face pain on your ear's. which is quite irritating. I have used Sony headphones but never faced any of the above issue's.3) A blue light will be blinking by indicating it is switched On, But during night as it's light display size is quite big and it just keep reflecting very brightly in night. Which is little awkward for someone else sitting or present .This has much con's than the pro's, But if you want a bluetooth headphone for less price and good Sound quality, Then only U go with this. But Make sure you are ok with all con's."
4,A great headphone with amazing sound qualityPros:-1. Amazing design2. great battery life3. fast bluetooth connection4. good sound qualityCons1. not very comfortable for extended usage2. a bit sound leakageI think it is the best headphones one can buy under Rs. 2000 after some tiny problems.
1,If zero star is an option then it definitely deserves it.Within 3 days the bluetooth connectivity stops working and the only option was to connect using the provided cable.My main reason to purchase was to listen to the audio wirelessly but it failed. With cable the audio become low ( maybe my phone is bad ) but still it is manageable.Within one month the cable connection become loose and now it is a complete garbage. Only thing I like is the plastic and cushion quality it provided.Bass is okay but if you are a music freak then you should consider some other options.Also note that I'm using the boat stone 200 for almost 2 years now and it is working beyond my expectations. Maybe they should not enter in the headphones business or maybe it's only my product that failed .... =PConclusion :- waste of money
5,"I've been using this product since last ten days.. it's beautifully designed and comfortable to wear..I liked it at the first instant..And seems quite durable with fit and finish.. on acoustics part I can assure u it's the best ones for bass lover at this price(1500rs)..But mids and highs are not that top notch.. though it's pleasant.. battery backup, connectivity are best to experience.. I hardly charged it since receiving on 1 and half hr of daily use.. Go for it if u r looking to wear something trendy and durable headphones with above average performance.."
2,"I was very eager to get my hands on Boat Rockerz 510 and when its price dropped to Rs 1500, I didn't think twice and ordered it. After 4 days of patience, I got this headphone and the first thing I noticed was its sturdy body. I must say that it looked pretty durable and its sound quality was nice. The pros and cons of the piece I recieved are below:Pros:1. Durable body.2. Great audio quality at low to mid volume.3. Good bass (No thumping though)4. Wonderful battery life.Cons:1. No thumping bass.2. Not much comfortable for people with a little longer head like me.3. Audio leakage.4. Voice crack.After reading other reviews I was confirmed that the piece I recieved was defective so I placed replacement. By then, the price had reached Rs 2200. After 1 week, I received an another piece and as soon as I picked it up, my heart was shattered. This piece was worse than the first one. Its left part were literally dangling as if someone pulled it very hard. The audio leakage in this one was horrible! Let alone thumping bass, the sound quality was itself worst.I was left with no other option but to place return-and-refund.Waiting for another price drop now because by what I have experienced from the quality of both the pieces, this headphone is not at all worth Rs 2000. I might as well die of laughter if someone buys it for its MRP."
1,"I purchased 510 today itself and after 10-15 mins of usage decided to return it!!Please do not purchase. I went through the reviews and even YouTube videos.Hell lot of sweating within 5 mins (I do have heavy face that too with specs), too tight to fit in my head, you cannot play songs at even mid volume - everyone out there will enjoy what songs you are listening to.Music (volume) 1/10Comfort 0/10What else I can say."
1,"I picked up this headphone a few months back seeing all the positive reviews and am giving my review after a few months of usage.The headphones is very good, the audio quality and bass is excellent,  battery backup is excellent, bluetooth connectivity is good, noise cancellation is good because of the tight cushions, the cushions is quite good and i was happy with my purchase. the only disadvantage i noticed initally is my ears tend to get heated up for prolonged usage ie more then 30 minutes.Even after months of usage there is no deterioration of sound or change in cushioning effect.The problem is after a few months the headset itself got loose and i cant seem to keep it around my ears. even a slight tilt of my head causest he headphones to drop off or swivel around my ears. There is no physical damage or cracks in the headphones and its good as new as evident in the picture. Also i have been the only sole user of the headphones and no one else has used it. I have always used it at home and not carried it out.I wish it would have lasted longer then this. My older headphones ( bluedio) lasted for much longer time.  Now looking for a new headphones planning to pick up.Not very happy about as care should be taken for material used to build the headphone also rather then putting all the emphasis on the sound or electronic part."
3,"HiAfter hours charging it shows 90% battery level in Bluetooth details when I connect to mobile.After few hours usage like 4 hours. IT still shows same 90% battery level.What does it mean?Is this product fault or it is normal shows?I need some answers for this, so that I could exchange soon.Except battery level, everything working fine."

Have to adjust to it, not a perfect fit/design. The bass was very noticeable. But while playing battle royale games, the 12 starting troubling too much and had to download the equaliser to make it simple but it was again getting unstable after a few minutes and the microphone when we turn on the microphone the audio in the headphone comes with high bass and gets Monostereo which is worst for battle royale multiplayer games. The battery is just awesome after using it for 10 hours the battery was still 60% which is extremely good. Battery life is about 30 hrs with casual usage. the range in a closed area is about 20 feet which is also extremely good but Bluetooth 5.0 is better. I was getting some delay while gaming, about 300ms. Good for online meeting etc but not for gaming. I got it for rupees 1895 which is quite expensive.And I had download the boat lifestyle app to use the Alexa feature with but the headphones but it's just an advertising trick we have to press a button on the app it again and again and we have to also link our account with Amazon which also take some time. The app sometimes does not even detect the headphones and the UI of the app is also not so good."
5,"Amazon delivery service is superb ! Ordered the item late night and received free prime delivery at door step 11:30AM next morning.Pros:1.)Product is having excellent sound quality & Durability. Has premium fit and finish. It's a large headset mostly suited as home entertainment. Available in nice 4 different colours red,blue,orange & Green.2.)Bluetooth connectivity is great having good range and hassle free setup. I could easily pair with my Laptop,Mobile and Ipad covering Windows/Linux/Android and IOS.3.)Sound is crystal clear with no any noise or interference even at max operating distances.4.)In every review I read about the ""ultra-powerful thumping bass"" experience. I was kind of skeptical whether so much bass could be a spoiler. However the output is very adequate with great vocal clarity. I would say perfect. (I am also using original Iphone wired ear buds. Sound quality/bass on it is good as well.5.)Superb battery life. I am using it extensively from the time I received it and looks like battery duration wont be a problem at all. Also it supports Dual mode allowing both wired and wireless. As per specs with a 400mah battery it should fast charge and full charge in 3hrs from any micro USB connector cable.6.)Calls made paired with my oneplus6 mobile were crystal clear without any interference. The built-in mic seems great too.Cons:1.)It's a large headset mostly suited as home entertainment ,I prefer ear buds while travelling or at office.2.)Your ears tend to pain after wearing it for sometime. It's OK though.3.)Sound leaks and is like an external speaker if the volume is above 70%. For this headset I would say the optimal operating volume should be less than 60%, where you can really listen,immerse and enjoy the music.4.)Could be broken/damaged if dropped accidentally from a reasonable height.I liked the product very much and highly recommend if you are looking for near premium/professional Wireless Bluetooth Headphones. Go for it !!!"
5,"The bass and surround sound effect makes you feel comfortable and enjoy music even at high volumes, keeping the noise to the minimum. An excellent product for that price ! totally worth the purchase"
4,"I use it with my MI Note 4, and I've been using it since last two months.Things I found totally satisfying:1) The bass is good.2) Looks quite cool.3) Battery back up is good, I use it for like 1.5-2hrs a day and it works for 3 days generally.4) Noise cancellation is nice, I go for jog in the morning, and travel on Mumbai locals with it on my head.Things I'm not that satisfied with:1) It starts to hurt my ears in like 45mins or something.2) The sound is not that clear and crisp. Product has been emphasised for bass, so the music clarity is a bit bad.One thing I'm really frustrated about:1) I can't keep my phone in my pocket, the connectivity suffers. Many a times, even when I'm holding the phone in my hand, I face a hell of glitches and slurs and stutters and it annoys me hell.It would have been fine if it happened less often, but it happens a bit more than sometimes."
1,The Bluetooth doesn't seem to work properly. Once u connect and just keep the phone 1 feet away the connection is disturbed and u can't listen to songs...not once but i cancelled the product and got a replacement but the same problem with the other new product also...so returned both finally
2,"I got new headphone. Opened and it and connected to system, the left ear piece was not working. Complained to customer through online system. They replaced it with new one. Today only i received the new headphone. Working fine. Will revert with detail review after use.But food for thought, i have seen all these (Irrespective of brand) headphones, the left speaker does not work after some time. Even the wire going to left speaker is intact but still the left side stops working."
2,"Edit: after charging it 4 to 5 times, the charging socket broke off and fell inside the headphones. Now it won't charge. No service centre in Pune so I have to file a claim. Will update once I get a response from the company. Sad, I didn't expect this.Just got these headphones and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised! Sound quality rivals other headphones ten times the price, build and finish is excellent. Yesterday I was listening to music for about four hours and the battery only went down 10 percent. They're very comfortable for long term wear, though they are a bit bulky. They block out noise pretty well too. All in all an A-one product at a very reasonable price."
1,"If you are looking for a product that lasts, do not buy this. This is my 3 Boat product, previously owned two in ear headphones, and this is my third. None of their products last. The 2 in ear headphones last about 6 months each. Initially the product works fine, it provides a really good acoustic experience. With the Rockerz 510, I first had Bluetooth battery charging issues, then the sound began to get distorted and then I raised a ticket and got a replacement. The replaced piece worked for less than a month and the distortion started again and I have to raise a ticket again to get it fixed and all this within 9 months. Also the Audio Cable and Charging Cable quality is just pathetic, I had to replace it with new ones twice."
2,Dont buy it..if you are playing any game like  PUBG it lags audio and it doesn't support sometimes mic while playing PUBG and other thing if you playing PUBG and trying to listen song the audio quality is just like chinese earphones with lots of noise..and it doesn't support multiple things at a time
5,Nice product...üëçüëç..
4,"It says 8 hrs but since I use this to watch lectures it gives more than 15hrs+ battery life.Sound quality is good, Highs & Lows are perfectly managed but to term these as Bass Heavy would be widely mistake.Overall 4 stars"
4,the base is really good. it a value for this range of money.i really liked it.only the comfort has to be more good.
1,"This product was had manufacturing defect inside the plastic band material,from which it is now broken out, that could not be visible during product receiving time period. Please do something for this automatic damaging, I wanted number of time to connect with customer care service but no any my call receiving by customer service. Please do the satisfactory advice to repair or exchange purpose because this product is under guarantee period. I was received this order on 14 May 2020."
2,"Edit: After 1 year of usage.The headphone starts developing cracks in the overhead plastic band, the padding on the earcups and head band started coming off. The boat logo has completely vanished (all this happened even after taking utmost care). The sound is still fine.Please be aware of the cheap plastic and poor built quality of the headphone. Instead of this you can buy Blaupunkt BH01 Eqz headphones which are the best at this price.PS. The gold plating on the AUX cable will come off creating much disturbance while connecting and listening to music rendering it useless.EDIT: The sound cut-offs are annoying during watching films or playing. You can't hear some dialogues at low volume.Honest review after 46 days of usage...PROS:‚Ä¢ Good sound quality, vocals are crystal clear. Nice to see AUX cable bundled in the box itself.‚Ä¢ You can get rich bass in Bluetooth and above average bass using the wired connection.‚Ä¢ The ear cups are padded with good quality foam and faux leather, no pain on continuous use (Used it for 2-2.5 hours and was still very comfortable).‚Ä¢ Value for money, Got it for 1099/- only.‚Ä¢ Not Bass heavy but you can tweak settings to get good bass.‚Ä¢ Good fit and design.‚Ä¢ Good Battery backup, got 7 hrs+ on single charge. Full charge takes about 2-3 hours, the orange LED goes off when fully charged.‚Ä¢ Build quality is good considering the price of the product.‚Ä¢ Call quality is average (the speaker is not so loud). The headphone also tells the Caller‚Äôs Number during an incoming call.‚Ä¢ The Latency is also acceptable at this price point.CONS:‚Ä¢ On Bluetooth, when the volume is kept very low and the music has a very low pitch, sometimes the left-right speakers turn ON and OFF automatically. (It can be eliminated by keeping volume bar at about 50%, also no problem when connected using Aux cable). I saw this problem in boAt Rockerz 450 as well.‚Ä¢ When kept at 100% volume the sound tends to get distorted. (Its THD-Total Harmonic Distortion is ‚â§5%, whereas most good headphones have it at ‚â§1%)‚Ä¢ The aux cable seems to be too thin so be careful while handling it.‚Ä¢ The earcups are not sweat resistant so take care of it."
5,Sound is very crystal clearBass is very pretty and goodValue for money
1,Bass is disgusting... Range is good but when I tried PUBG it keeps disconnecting continuously...Useless headphone...I returned it on the same day I received.
4,"Marvelous performanceIf you watch movies or series in Netflix,amazon or Hotstar this head set is perfect option Crysta clear sound may be not deep bass but you feel like theatre effect with perfect clear sound just go for it ....."
1,I have used it for 1 month after then the headphone literally breaked. Please My Dear friends a slight little push can break it. Headphone quality Is Cheap. Not for gamers. Dont Buy It
4,"Headphones are great but recieved the already used by someone headphones. Seal was broken and was reattached. Scratches were visible along side the earcups. Also when i watch something on Netflix, either the right side or the left one randomly keeps disconnecting and reconnecting Returned the product."
1,"I have been a huge fan of BoaT and have been purchasing headphones and wireless-only from them since it is an indian company.But, i was let down on the above product. Within one month the thing is broken. The sad part is that, when I uploaded the invoice which was downloaded from Amazon itself, the company BoaT has send a message to me stating the invoice is not theirs. So weird!!!So, when it comes to faulty products they have funny excuses to say NO."
4,Nice
1,"Didn't last for a month... It just broke .. as you can see. As one moth is over Amazon won't take it back. Whome to blame here Amazon or boat company!!If you still want to purchase..... Then go for jbl and sony products. Atleast they'll last much longer than than this pathetic product. You may spend 500-1000 extra money, but it worth it"
5,"Well I am writing this review after 6 months of daily usage. If you are looking for a headphone in mid range budget with awesome sound quality with a perfect bass then go for this.After my 6 months usage, I am totally satisfied with this product. The battery backup wonders me. After a full charge, if you use it 5-6 hours per day then it will last for about 4-5 days.The sound quality is also of high definition. Bass is also wonderful. Connectivity range is also good not very good. Just one thing with what I would like to say it Ok is its microphone . Microphone works well in noise cancelling but range of mic is some less.Overall you can purchase this product without any worries. I hope that you also will like it.I am regretting one thing also that is I had ordered black colour which I am not liking much as compared to other two colours"
5,Boat Rockers 310 is perhaps the best sounding product below Rs 1200. It's treble bass and volume up down functions are very good. The curved bar is soft and padded covered by leather. Once charged it can be used for 5 to 6 hours in Bluetooth connectivity mode. Aux cable and micro usb cable is provided as asseccory in packing box. A good choice to buy.
1,Plz don't buy this product.. after using half an hour your ears will start paining. Instead on ads they should work on quality of products.it broke after usage of one month.totally wastage of money.
1,"Poor Basic Headphones. Highly Overpriced. Sound is normal, no special bass or noise cancellation. Build and look very cheap and basic. Buttons not strudy. Unnecessarily Big. Does not look durable. Initial reaction - Very Bad. Amazon do not return Electronics if unsatisifed, only option to replace. No use as did not like the product itself."
4,I would like to start with pro sound is good and battery life also goodNow the con's you can't use it on summer because it will heat up you're ear and you can't use it for long time because it will hurt ear overall I can say it's a good product but I can't use it on summer it's hurting my ear
1,My ears and head stared paining. It's uncomfortable and the bass is also not good. The sound also bursts.
1,"No Voice cancellation in this product, for this cost, this is not worth product, Boat company is good in headset, but manufacturing such products will loose its brand image in the market"
1,"Product broke after 3 months of usage.not happy.i have claimed for a return and am waiting for a response from boat team.though when I called the customer service and said that the issue with my complaint is that one of the bands is broken,they said they cannot help me as it is physical damage.guys I did not have a problem with the audio but it did break very soon.i don‚Äôt think I am going to get a return on this product so I suggest you to go for a different product"
5,Super mind blowing
5,"After reading these reviews where some people really didn't like it and where some people loved it, I got really skeptical. I probably was about to cancel my order. But I got it anyways and It's so good. It fits my ears perfectly, it doesn't pain even after hours of usage. The sound is more than loud enough with enough bass and also has this really good theater effect. Kinda makes me look like a gamer girl not gonna lie lmao. But, anyways. So far my experience has been good. And yes it might be a little delicate but which headphones are not??? Just buy it guys don't fall for the bad reviews this headset is beautiful!!!"
2,"This product has poor built quality there is no voice cancellation at first when I ordered it it was pretty well but it started giving me problems after few weeks it had problem in connectiveti with Bluetooth and in some calls it would automatically ends the call . It not at all good for gameing . It has a very poor noise cancellation fataliti . After few weeks it just broke by stretching when I was wereing it for use poor quality if you are buying it is only good for less use or it will start creating problem it has an average sound quality.it is not good for meeting ,classes, gameing  very bad quality recommended not to buy this product is very bad no noise cancellation facility very bad build quality so you should not buy this product .very bad product this by stretching it breaks so build quality is very bad it does not  has an noise cancellation facility and this auxillary works not very well so I recommend not to buy this product"
4,Sound quality is no doubt a good point becoz of Boats company but i feel its Bluetooth connectivity is little bit pathetic sometimes it does connect with anybody else's phone and just make sure tht u have Ur phone very near 2 u otherwise there's a glitch which I heard from Google is dangerous due to the rays and I'll recommend u too charge even at 90 % battery becoz glitch starts to occur otherwise and yess it doesn't fall while exercising so that's a good point 2 me. Overall since 2 months usage it's been good and I keep it in its box only after usage and I got at a reasonable price so it's grrt fr me !
2,The headphones are kinda good in terms of the audio quality and battery backup.......but the build and the quality of the headphones is not that great as the ones which I ordered broke like shown in the photo and this happened very close to the time I actually ordered it and started using it........I used the headphones as I would have used any other headphones but the headphones just came apartü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
4,"For the price of 1100 with bluetooth 5, its a 4 star product. Some flaws are there too. Made of plastic, so will easily degrade/break. The funtion keys only work on bluetooth mode not with AUX cable. Ear cushion not too great, after long hours it may cause pain in ears."
5,"Its very cool, stylish, and high quality hd bass...just superb"
2,Bought it almost 4 months ago.Works fine while using it with the aux cable. But while in bt mode the music kinda fluctuates in low volumes.( Either left or right cut off or both of them cut offs)Had it increase volume so that the music starts Playing again.Not so happy with how it sits on my head.Might look good but ergonomics are poor.The build is alos not that satisfying.Already had many hairline cracks.
5,"I bought this to attend online classes of my college the battery life is very awesome i charge it once for 4-5 hours and it keeps working for more than a week, the quality of sound is nice but long hours of listening causes pain in ears which almost every headphones do,other than that best headphones, i purchased these at 999 in Amazon sale so at a big profit. Thanks for reading."
3,"Sound is all good and good hearing over bluetooth too, when connected to mobile / laptop. But 2 major issues I experienced:1. Cannot use bluetooth for making calls, attending meeting where I need to speak. The receiver is not able to hear my voice even though I kept the volume to maximum. So I am forced to use a wired connection for the mic to pickup my voice and make it audible to the other side.2. The build quality - Bought this in April 2021. The headset broke 10 days back, making it unusable. This is the first time a product like headset is broke [see photo] within 6 months of usage. I could have used it for not more than 200 hours at the maximum. Don't know if this is covered in the 1 year warranty that Boat has promised. Now I bought another headset of another brand. Actually disappointed with Boat over these issues."

3,"Pros1) Good Sound Quality with decent Bass2) Decent noice cancellation due to Tight earcussions.3) Great Aesthetics and Light WeightCons1) Sometimes there is no sound in one of the earcups2) They are not comfortable even for short period use. I ordered it specifically for online meetings but  they are uncomfortable and causes pain over ears in just 30 minutes. So forget long usage. Company claims these are""Ergonomically designed"". No they are not. It is designed such that if you increase headband size, they become more tight. There's no point of good sound quality if you can't wear them.Conclusion: Don't buy these if you looking for comfortable headphones. Buy these headphones only for their design. You can get same sound quality in other headphones for same price."
3,"I am using this headphone from last 2 days, here's my experience -1. I got this one for 13992. Battery capacity is really good, 10+ hrs3. Sound quality is good4. Bluetooth connectivity is good5.

1,"I can't believe the experience I've had with these headphones, when they arrived, I was unable to activate the warranty for it even after following all the steps mentioned in the package. Just after 20 days one side stopped working but it would suddenly start and stop working from time to time. I tried calling a service station but no one would pick up and provide me with any assistance, after a month and a half, one side has completely stopped working and now these headphones are just a waste, I wrote them a mail as well to help me with this issue and got no response. Don't buy this product it's not durable at all and has basically no after-sales support."
1,"Was working fine for the 1st week. Started to hear a crackling disturbance all the time, in around 2 weeks after buying it. Sadly, the return window had been closed by then. Now stuck with this useless e-waste. Fitting is very tight and uncomfortable. Of all the Bluetooth headsets I have used, this is the most uncomfortable and pathetic product. Go for something else even if they give it for free. As long as it was working fine, sound quality was good with proper noise cancelation."

3,Bass n sound quality is good. But while making calls other end can't hear me properly. Another issue is that ear start to pain after some time. Also built quality n material quality is very low don't look like a big brand product in real. Low quality plastic.
4,"This headphone is good for non-bass lovers. Like, if you don't listen to deep bass music, this headphone is good. Infact great..Rate:-Sound quality- 9.5/10Bass- 7.5/10Build quality:- 8/10Sound clearity:- 9/10Mic:- 4/10Total:- 38/50If you're buying for studies like me, then it is good option......"
5,"After using an Boult earphone and experienced the sound and built  quality, i didn't have to think too much to purchase this model. And it didn't disappoint.  The built quality is excellent and the ear pads are really comfortable. The ear pads may not wear off easily even with prolonged usage(looks like a leatherette). And the mic quality is good while taking calls. The wire is lengthy and shouldn't be a problem. The wire quality is sturdy as mentioned. Go for it!!"
5,It's a superior quality headphones.. awesome bass and for budget price.. I ordered after seeing some negative reviews but that's not the point . It's obviously under 700 product so you can't expect more but this is the product best for gaming and for music the bass is the main factor which make it beast ... Sound is a bit low then bass but it is important for the sound clarity .. Just go for it blindly ..Give it 1 hour coz of sound burn ... Happy to buy this ...

2,In ordered this product as I need to take calls from home. The first time it was delivered. It was a new package.. However the issue was with mic as it was picking up self voice thus making it difficult for calls. So ordered for replacement .on opening the second/ replacement package saw the box was broken.. Seal was also broken.. The headphone wire was kept in was way that it looked like used product was sent.. This is the first time I had such a experience..it is possible to have a defective product but used product is against ethical practice...initiated return of money..
4,"lets get directly into the Pros & Cons :-sry it will be a long review coz the review have to be useful for everyone who plans to buy this.Pros:-* The Price, given to this price bracket its the best one i can suggest from the built quality to the Audio quality its superior for the price 499/- (i got for this price tag)*then the Comfort, everybody complaining about the earpads i dont know why, if your going for over the ear type u have to be known that u cant wear it all day long the most expensive products also tend to warm your ears and get a little uncomfortable, so if its not preffered u can go for earphones or earbuds. as i bought multiple ober the ear headphones there will be rought cloth like texture that will irritate your ears, But this One has SOFT CUSHION like material, im really comfortable with this one.*and next the Audio Quality, i have previosuly owned boult in-ear earphones so i know the bass quality and vocal quality, so i booked this without even thinking twice, and it has delivered what it can. the best part is im really comfortable in this one than my in-ear earphones, the sound is even better and you dont get high volume levels like those local cheap products on the markets. but the Bass and Clarity will give you some extra feel, especially the BASS.. its really engaging, if ur a Bass lover go for it.*then the Quality, i know the Boult for sometime but for over the ear headphones at this price point i was little skeptical about the build quality before the delivery and it suprised me, dont think that build quality is extraordinary like sennheiser or Sony coz ur not paying that much for this, so for this price its so good, even better than the boat headphones which is slightly high in the price tag.Now Cons:-* little skeptical about the Warranty, because when i gone to register this and both while i was registered my boult in-ear earphones, they didnt asked for Invoice slips and No serial number is asked, then how can they proceed if we call for the warranty claims?... but hopefully i think this will last long as seeing the quality.* Next is the Cable Quality, i didnt complaining about it, but they mentioned in amazon as its an Kevlar Cable, so i expected a lott but its a normal cable bt its Sturdy enough.*** i didnt check the mic on it, i make a call on this, the other person was able to understand me, but i dont know hows the quality.To Help you guys, i have metioned every aspect in detailed manner so it can helpful for people who spend their valuable money (coz every single rupee counts)..Have a Nice and Safe Shopping. Bye‚ò∫Ô∏è"
1,"This is not a bluetooth headset.Product specs say 48 hour battery and average battery life of 12 hours.Package contents mention, USB cable included.All you get is a normal wired headset."
3,This is a simple wired headset that's it. Although the sound quality I would say that it is okay.Just got it today comes with simple in built mic.IT DOES NOT HAVE NOISE CANCELLATION FEATURE NOR THE CHARGING PART WITH USB AND 48 HOURS  BATTERY CHARGE IS TRUE.Little disappointed about price and features hoping for good performance
1,"The product got damaged within 2 days. Buds came out from over ear and it doesn't look like a 2000‚Çπ Headphones. But the sound quality was okay compared to other headphones at this price point, but when it comes to build quality the product is lacking. Can you please refund the money I don't need a headphone from this company anymore"
3,"The product package was poor and the hardboard seal was brocken, when I got the product. Normally I have to refuse the product but amazon wrapping over the product package misleaded me at the time of delivery. Anyway the product inside is new therefore I didn't returned it. But during this pandemic it's not fare which done by Amazon. Everyone's health is precious. Need more carefulness about the packages.This Bolt Audio Buds Q2 overhear is a nice product. I have purchased it for ‚Çπ699/-Sound Quality 3/5.Noise Cancellation 3/5.Bass 3/5.Outlook and quality : Average.Value for the money : 4/5.Verdict : 3.75/5.NB: This review is based on just 1week after the purchase. 1 year Guarantee card also provided with the product."
4,"Overall the product is good , kindly consider the Actual rating of the Product. Bass-4/5Treble-3.5/5Vocal Balance- 4.5/5Value for Money-4/5Noise cancellation-4/5Comfortable-4/5(If you using the product as WFH purpose , then the Rating is 5/5)((If you using the product as Entertainment purpose , then the Rating is 4/5)Thanks"
1,Just received the product... Right side not working... When I hold the wire in a particular position it works.. if not it doesn't it... Also accessories box was empty. Picture representation on the box and product doesn't match.
5,Much better than I had expected.
5,The audio quality is amazing and in this price range it is awesome product must buy this product and enjoy the music and perfect calling experience through headphones
5,"I use these for audio and video calls on both my phone (android) and laptop (windows based), hence I am not rating these for gaming, which I do not use them for. I have used them regularly for over 4 months.When using, please be aware that the gain in these headphones is very high, so keep the volume lower than you would keep with the phone/laptop speakers (about half the volume), otherwise you will get a headache. The volume has to be adjusted at the phone/laptop, since there is no volume control on the headset.The microphone is good, and I usually don't get complaints about not being able to be heard, which happened with my old in-ear set. (However, with a nylon jacket, the mic can rub against that when walking, and create noise, so you will have to hold it away from such clothes).Since these are over-ear, they are more comfortable than in-ear. However, older people (who have bigger ears), may experience discomfort if used continuously for several hours. People up to about 30-35 years will find them very comfortable. 50+ will face some discomfort over time.It blocks outside sound reasonably well. You can hear if someone is calling to you, but ordinary conversations nearby do not disturb you on the call.I find the adjustable over-head band quite comfortable once adjusted properly.All in all, a very good product."
3,"First of all package was open, mostly used one. I dont have time to return. Flikart is better. My bad..Lookwise it was decent product, but not satisfied with the quality of the voice. So its an average product that match with price.. Please note never buy this product for more than 500 else you will regret."
1,I wish I could rate the product zero writing this after 1 month usage. At first you might get pretty impressed by the look and feel of the product but later you will realise the it's the worst purchase ever it stopped working just in one month whereas I do not even have a very rough usage hardly used 10 times and the problems started I can't hear anything I have to keep adjusting the jack all the time
5,one of the best wired headphones in this price range is really unexpectable. as my sister is using this as she needed a good bass and good noise cancellation headphones so i gave her this bass is much soft and these are easy to wear and comfortable in wearing no pain. thanx to amazon and boult.
1,For first couple of months the headphone worked well. After 2nd month they started showing issues... The ear cushions started falling off because the earphone mecahnics wore off. The headphone jack got lose and had to be fitted hard into mobile phones otherwise phones would behave funnily. Mic stopped working and changed to a low reception mono quality. I had to stop using them in online meetings.
1,Only the outer Amazon cover was closed.The bubble cover was torn and the product sealed box was open as shown in the Picture.Also the headset looked like Used one.Never expected this.Pathetic experience.
5,"It's a genuine review I bought 2 headphones back to back, really very nice product from Boult. It was my first product from Boult before that I had used sony & boat headphones but this one is awesome. Sound quality mid, high and bass is very good. I am 100% satisfied. Highly recommended in this price range."
4,"The product is good but disappoint of it Delivery package,it took me 2 times of replacing the product.Amazon to look in this, otherwise its not up to your Advertising standards.Here they just simply pasted the delivery address ie other side of the box & send it i received both the boxes as same & looking the second box some what far better than previous so adjusted to accepting the second one.Here my only thing to say that Amazon to check in these thing as previously i had same like this but even choosing Amazon only for the Name.hope so others have notfaced like this if so  then Amazon too became like Gully Indian Company."
3,"Ordered the product 2+ weeks back, received with a delay of several days. Package received was in bad condition, the box was mutilated, torn, damaged. The product packaging inside was damaged and torn. The seal on the box was broken on both sides. The headphone itself appeared clearly used. There was a small paper box that said Accessories but was empty.I raised the replacement request the same day.Received a replacement after another few days.This time the box was delivered without any amazon plastic packaging and that made sense. The delivery agent as well as myself could transparently see the condition of the box which this time was fine. The product seals were intact and on top of that there was an amazon seal too.Upon opening i found the product in good condition as it should be.The same small accessory box was there this time too and was empty, not sure why they send it all.The headphone is a good fit with comfortable head pad and ear cup pads. The fit is good and they do not slip off easily when one tilts their head.The sound quality is also good, with good bass levels too. I tested them with songs like Trampoline, Hotel California, Def Leppard songs and in all cases found the audio quality good.The sound quality on phone and video meeting calls is also fair.The build appears fragile and does not look durable. The head band extender notches appear very plasticky and do not appear as if they might withstand repeated usage. Time will tell.Overall i found the headphone reasonably priced for what it offers but am not very satisfied with the build quality and the product packaging. I also did not like the really long wait times for delivery as well as replacement."
1,"Stopped working in less than a month. Called Amazon for warranty and was given a number to call Boult directly to claim the warranty. The number works, however if you are claiming warranty, the automated voice says we would receive a SMS with a link to a form, which needs to be filled in. Called about 5 times, however the SMS never came. Basically, the warranty is a hoax. I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again, none of their products."
5,Unexpected good quality product at this price point. Build is plastic but it sturdy and lightweight. Fits over the ear and noise cancellation is also ample. Earcups feel comfortable and soft even if worn for long hours. Cable is good and sturdy quality with dedicated mic for calls. Sound is exceptionally good considering bass and treble levels. Go for it if you are looking for best in budget segment.
1,"Don't buy the product. I bought seeing 1 year warranty. Within 4 months one side of headphones stopped working. Gradually both sides stopped working. On complaint a very late reply was given. Absolutely Pathetic companyThe customer support contacted me although after 1 month,  but still their whole purpose was to make me edit or remove this bad review about them. They asked me to send the product which I did they repaired it and sent it back but again it stopped working. So within one year it got trouble twice. NOT WORTHY at all."
5,"The Boult over-ear headphones are providing more immersive sound experience.  I work in front of computer for hours at a time, and almost always have headphones on.  Every single other pair I have tried ended up making my ears hurt before long, except this one. While the construction quality is decent, I do expect to run through a new pair every couple years, but at this price point, it's really hard to complain.  Nice product to recommend."
1,"Within a month of buying, it stopped working, I could hear sound only on one side. Also they don't have service centres all over India. I had to send the product by courier to Delhi. They repaired it because of warranty. But one thing remains that if problem arise again I need to again send to Delhi . Every time money spent in courier."
1,No cooperation from amazon. The description is bloody deceiving and amazon doesnt even accept returns on this category anymore. These are not over the ear head phones. They hurt your ears after 30 mins. Make sure that you are ok with it before making this purchase.
1,"I received the product in May first week but after one month one Speaker of headphone stopped working. Registered the issue with the company and they have collected a faulty product from me on 26 June 2021. After one month lot of follow-up, 28th July received the product but surprise they return me without repair or replacement. Still, the problem is there and it is not working properly. My headphone was in service center for one month and received with out repair.Not good quality product and service are also not good. They are providing a one-year warranty but in the warranty period they are not doing anything"
3,Not value for money.Bad quality plastics are used.Not suitable for gaming or anything.Sound quality is not good.It feels like bass and treble are mixed together.One can get these for around 300 at local shops.Instead by in ear headphones @400 from boat.Noise cancellation is fine.Instead buy other headsets of around 1k for better everything.
1,"Pros:1. Soft cushions used; doesn't pain the ears even during prolonged use2  Foldable ear pieces helps in easy storage. Even while keeping on the desk, you could fold a ear piece to rest on that side. This prevents wear and tear of the ear pads.3. Call mute\cancel button provided.Cons:1. Within a month of usage, minor sounds started coming from the ear pieces.2. MIC stopped functioning. Party on the other side was not able to hear anything.3. Since it's within warranty period, emailed customer care but no response even after two weeks (maybe due to pandemic situation).4. Their warranty clause states that we should ship it back to their address. But buying a new one seems feasible than bearing shipping charges from Bangalore to New Delhi.5. As on 17 th July 2021, after more than 2 weeks of raising complaint request, I am yet to hear back from them!Having said that, Boult's in-ear headsets have given me trouble-free performance for more than a year, the reason I choose this headset while looking for an over-the-ear model. But it disappointed."
1,Ok so after 5 moths of working its left side is now not working and I have emailed them because the product is in warranty but they havent replied..Edit: its been 1-2 week since I have registered for replacement but they are just making excusesEdit2: Now they are saying courier the product to Delhi..WORST COMPANY EVER SEEN
5,"It is not a gaming headset for sure. But is good for music. The performance is good, but not great. There are better ones out there, but are a bit expensive. The output is good. At this price, this is a good product. For Online meetings, music, and daily use. Cannot say it is best for gaming."
1,"The box wasn't seal packed. Seems like an used product, minor scratches are visible. Sound quality is good, so I'm not returning it. Please don't send open boxes & used products.Decent headphone for the price.Edit : left side stopped working, tried contacting service team but no one is responding. Pathetic service from Boult.Edit : Left side stopped working after 2 month. Tried to contact for repair or replace but no response from the brand. Utterly disappointed !"
5,"I bought it @599/-. After a couple of weeks, the audio in the left ear was completely missing. Even otherwise, the audio was sputtering. I returned it in the warranty period. They simply repaired and sent me the same headphones. I personally am not at all happy with the product or the service. They should have replaced my headphones with a new one. The Sony headphones @599/- are far better."
1,"The headphone stopped working after a month of purchase. The product is in warranty period and it has been more then a week since I raised the complaint, there has been no action or resolution from Boult. Don't get fooled by their warranty period clause,it is just a way of fooling customers. If the headphone has issues , then better to throw it instead of running behind their customer service."
3,"I bought this in April 2021 (it is now 6 months old) and it has already started failing. There is no sound that can be heard on the left side unless I adjust the wire in a certain way. Definitely thought that this product would have a longer life - unfortunately, it doesn't.The design however is amazing. It fits perfectly and is very comfortable. Doesn't give full noise cancellation, but enough to make you concentrate on whatever it is you're listening to."
5,It's much better than boat not only in sound but quality and comfort. You can use it for more time than boat. It has got better bass however treble is better in boat. Overall I'm satisfied with this product.
2,The product was great but there was some issues so I send this product with another Boult product as a warranty claim but they found out that I had send them only one product after so many complains they refuse to return my boult Bass head product and this is my first time experience from boult and from now one I don't suggest anyone to buy boult audio product I would rather suggest using Boat which is much more trust worthy because they take the product from home but for Boult Audio you have to parcel it and if you send more than one product there is a very less chance that you get both the product so it's really a disgusting service from Boult.Never ever gone buy from Boult...
1,"I'm writing this review after almost 1.5 months of use and the left speaker has already stopped working.I'm considering that mine is one of the rare cases where the product malfunctions due to certain issues so I'll try to write it without being bias.The design itself is a problem, it is in such a way that it causes strain on the ears and cause ache in helix and antihelix part of the ear.Sound quality is average, no thing special there, but it deteriorates in about 2-3 weeksBass is definitely above average but with loss in sound quality it's effect is minimised.Built quality is definitely not good considering it malfunctioned in just over a month.."
5,This is a 30 day review from my side so if you are really planning to buy this product please read this review entirely so that you are clear about your choice.....So I ordered this product and recieved it the other day...superfast delivery....then I unboxed the product...the packing can be rated 4 stars...the headphones look damn good and are very much comfy..sound quality is also good but a little lower than the best...and battery life is amazing...I charged it once fully and I was able to use it for 2 weeks straight at probably 2 hours a day...battery life is best...sound quality is good... comfortable and durable...best product in this range....and don't forget BASS quality is the best...note this is 30 day review so it is very accurate...
2,"about a year after purchase first the battery stopped charging so bluetooth feature couldn't be used, and soon after that the ear protective pads fell offwaste of money"
1,"Made it China! Warranty is just on paper,they don't seem to work in reality.Sound quality is kinda ok but deteriorates after 6 months of usage and that causes headache.The synthetic layer of the cushion isn't of good quality.Bluetooth range is good and battery works fine.Spend a little more and go for good brands."
5,"Its one of the best headphones for this price( i bought it for 2k). It has super powerful bass and clear sound quality. It can be used either using Bluetooth or it can be wired. It is compatible for Android, ios and for PC or laptops. This headphone is for serious music lovers who love extra bass and it is also good for watching movies or for gaming. It has many buttons so i don't have to take my phone at all. Finally i would suggest people to buy this rather than buying boAt rockerz 400."
4,"So allow me write a very technical and accurate review about the amazing Boat 510.Amazon was as usual on time and excellent with the delivery of the product.Now the thing about the headphones isThey work extremely fine while on Bluetooth.I have tried with my pc and some mobiles the sound quality is uncompromised even during the low volume. The bass is very noticeable.As soon ass you plug in the jack in your device, the bass is lost/reduced. The headphones will start sounding flat. With only the highs and mids, no lows. I think Boat should work on this particular aspect.Otherwise the headphones are amazing.Must buy for daily use.But if you're a person who's producing music or working with sounds much more professionally I would recommend to try try Boat 600 or higher.Thankyou."
3,"Well if you're looking for a decent gaming headphones that this product is not the one you're looking for.so straight to pros and cons:Pros-1.  these have a premium look.2. cushioning is good.3. Bass is good.4. Battery is also good(upto 7-8 hrs).5- decent headphones in this price range (i got these for 1500 rs).cons-1. these are not flexible.2. bass is good but you can't listen to melody songs, these headphones adds bass to them too. you'll get bass in almost every song so you have to use equalizers to avoid that.3. this is the most annoying problem i found in this product ,actually this is the problem that comes in almost every bt headphones(so basically if you are looking for gaming headphones don't go for BT headphonesreason:- it uses dual profile system in 1st profile you can use stereo with good sound but you can't use mic and in 2nd profile you can use mic but sound quality changes to mono and you'll have an awful experience with that.)"
1,"First of all, the after sale service is very very poor, I've an issue with the headset,i filed a complaint on their website, the sales guy took the headset & i didn't get any information from Boat rockerz about my headset & still i don't know where it is.So, please be careful with thisAnd rest sound quality is good, battery life is poor & major issue in Bluetooth button."
5,"I got it for 1300 after many discounts....Seriously, these are the best if you want in below 2k range...People who say these are bad might have gotten a bad piece which they can exchange within 10 days with replacement guarantee and the other category people who are fans of Good Treble can stay away from these, these are for people who love that extra bass... These are the ones who are giving negative reviews to this piece of beauty..üòÅI say go ahead and order this piece of music weapon if you are a true fan of bass.."
5,Now I don't know much about bass and treble and such stuff but these headphones are pretty good. I can charge then for 2 hours and they work for 6-7 hours which is pretty good. The sound quality is decent and the range is great. I mainly use it in the gym and the ear buds gets a bit sweaty which I find uncomfortable but you can easily wipe the sweat off. They're pretty stable when working out and don't shake very easily or fall off.
5,"It's really a value for money product. But in the sale of Amazon it's looking costly compared to other as Flipcart. In great Indian festival its lowest price is ‚Çπ1,849/- but in Flipcart big billion days its lowest price is only ‚Çπ1,499/- . It's the difference."
5,Sound quality - excellent 10/10Battery life - excellent 10/10Durability - excellent 9.5/10This is the best headphone and i am sure that it gives top quality sound in the low budget and it can surely beat JBL....Go for it and buy!Note :- my phone is having dolby atmos music service and the sound quality may differ on your use of the headphone.
1,"They crush the ears. wearing them for about an hour is an ordeal. Sound quality is not what it is expected to be. Drums get lost somewhere. noise cancellation, though passive, is OK. but the discomfort offered on the ear overshadows every single positive they may have."
1,"Hi Team,Its a very cheap quality product.As in 30 days its damaged, battery dead, Bluetooth properly not working. Now somebody please tell what i have to do with this cheap headphone.Now i can't returned it as i m out of india.. Please don't buy this product.. Its a humble request. I need to highlight this issue in  social media."
1,"First lets talk abhout sound quality its not good at all, high quality sounds start to cracle and this headset said it has 'extraaaaaaaaa powerful bass' what exactly written on the box literally this headset has zero bass just flat sound, don't get me wrong it has some bass to it but that type of bass also given by Rs. 50 earphones, these headset start to vibrate like hell on full volume some people said on review you can get best bass on full volume but by doing that your partner can also experience the music , cheap plastic used seems like it will get broken just in one fall. Yes it has some good points too, it has good Bluetooth range. If that is the reason to buy it. No correct indicator for its battery. My earphones are much better then this. If you want... Their name is QKZ Just search for them."
5,I have been using using since 2 Years .... still battery is not drained out !! sound Quality is above standard and impressive. Material and Look is Good !! Liked this product. feeling very little pressure on ear but if you want noise cancellation then you have to manage this. overall this is very good product. Nothing can beat it !!
1,"First, this is On Ear headphones and not Over the Ear. Product description is totally wrong.Second, when you increase the volume above 55%, your neighbor can hear everything.Third, Bluetooth compatibility is not that great  when connected with Laptop.You Ears will start paining after 5 mints use."
5,Long battery life.but fitment loose
5,"I took my time to write this review. Didn't really want to rush. And i must say this is one really good product. Sound quality is good, given its very reasonable price. The bass is cool. I checked the sound fidelity using a few YouTube videos that test for the range of frequencies a headphone can handle and reproduce ...i must say this headphone has done extremely well in those audio tests. The setup is ultra easy..i also make conference calls with this headphone (WebEx)..and i have confirmed from the other side..that the mic quality is also good.The only thing I can't yet comment is the durability..as i have used it only for a month..and it has been good so far...Verdict :  go for it. Good one to have. The viper green colour is really awesome...no wonder i was charged additional bucks to purchase it. I have a total of 3 of this headphone pairs..."
1,"A size of headphone is too big... Sound coming outside, plastic head handle... Easily damage"
4,"Pros ...On full volume , bass is commendable . Battery life is cool ...Although I used 3 -4 times for short periods it's been 36 hrs and battery remains untouched ...Same as it was at the time of delivery (90*/*)Product has a comfortable neck cushion which provides thickness to the product , comfort to neck , and durability . ITS easy to connect , use and play ur vibe in attractive look with flamy red colour . The bluetooth compatibility range is around 10m which is more than enough ..After that glitch in sound can be heard.Cons....The thing which disappointed me was the volume decrease button , which didn't worked . But still Not a great problem , Mobile phone may help ."
4,Hi i am writing this review to tell you guys that these headphones are infact great. It got the value for thw money. But i am having a problem i am hoping if someone could explain it to me. Whenever i charge and i put the plug on there is the red light on the headphones which i assume is indicating charging but it goes off in 5 mins and i have to keep plugging it again and again but still it the red light turns off. So how do i know if my headphones are changing or not?
5,The product is too good. Quality bass. Durability is also amazing. I would consider to buy. Simple to operate. Bluetooth connectivity and Aux connectivity available which fulfills both the needs that is what I liked the most.
5,Got these in sale for just rs 1500 only. I thought that these are just like the normal Bluetooth headphones... I've test these with my one plus 6 and really im amazed with the bass it provides...but dont get me wrong...the bass is like slightly better than any of the headphones in the same price segment.... although i recommend it completely...because BoAt didn't compromised with the sound quality and bass deepness with these ones!!
3,"I am giving 3-Star only for the Sound Quality. i'll go directly on Pro's and concernPro's:1) Sound Quality for the price range is very good.2) Bluetooth connection is good. U can connect your laptop and Mobile at a time. So it's a multi-connection.3) Battery Backup is very good for the price range headphone's, I am getting more than 10++ hour's backup for one charge.(At least I have watched 5 to 6 movies in one charge).Con's:1) Worst design or Plastic quality.(I have replaced an item due to some bad noice/Sound like something left inside the  headphone not fixing properly).2) After sometime's(30 to 45min) of continues use you'll face pain on your ear's. which is quite irritating. I have used Sony headphones but never faced any of the above issue's.3) A blue light will be blinking by indicating it is switched On, But during night as it's light display size is quite big and it just keep reflecting very brightly in night. Which is little awkward for someone else sitting or present .This has much con's than the pro's, But if you want a bluetooth headphone for less price and good Sound quality, Then only U go with this. But Make sure you are ok with all con's."
4,A great headphone with amazing sound qualityPros:-1. Amazing design2. great battery life3. fast bluetooth connection4. good sound qualityCons1. not very comfortable for extended usage2. a bit sound leakageI think it is the best headphones one can buy under Rs. 2000 after some tiny problems.
1,If zero star is an option then it definitely deserves it.Within 3 days the bluetooth connectivity stops working and the only option was to connect using the provided cable.My main reason to purchase was to listen to the audio wirelessly but it failed. With cable the audio become low ( maybe my phone is bad ) but still it is manageable.Within one month the cable connection become loose and now it is a complete garbage. Only thing I like is the plastic and cushion quality it provided.Bass is okay but if you are a music freak then you should consider some other options.Also note that I'm using the boat stone 200 for almost 2 years now and it is working beyond my expectations. Maybe they should not enter in the headphones business or maybe it's only my product that failed .... =PConclusion :- waste of money
5,"I've been using this product since last ten days.. it's beautifully designed and comfortable to wear..I liked it at the first instant..And seems quite durable with fit and finish.. on acoustics part I can assure u it's the best ones for bass lover at this price(1500rs)..But mids and highs are not that top notch.. though it's pleasant.. battery backup, connectivity are best to experience.. I hardly charged it since receiving on 1 and half hr of daily use.. Go for it if u r looking to wear something trendy and durable headphones with above average performance.."
2,"I was very eager to get my hands on Boat Rockerz 510 and when its price dropped to Rs 1500, I didn't think twice and ordered it. After 4 days of patience, I got this headphone and the first thing I noticed was its sturdy body. I must say that it looked pretty durable and its sound quality was nice. The pros and cons of the piece I recieved are below:Pros:1. Durable body.2. Great audio quality at low to mid volume.3. Good bass (No thumping though)4. Wonderful battery life.Cons:1. No thumping bass.2. Not much comfortable for people with a little longer head like me.3. Audio leakage.4. Voice crack.After reading other reviews I was confirmed that the piece I recieved was defective so I placed replacement. By then, the price had reached Rs 2200. After 1 week, I received an another piece and as soon as I picked it up, my heart was shattered. This piece was worse than the first one. Its left part were literally dangling as if someone pulled it very hard. The audio leakage in this one was horrible! Let alone thumping bass, the sound quality was itself worst.I was left with no other option but to place return-and-refund.Waiting for another price drop now because by what I have experienced from the quality of both the pieces, this headphone is not at all worth Rs 2000. I might as well die of laughter if someone buys it for its MRP."
1,"I purchased 510 today itself and after 10-15 mins of usage decided to return it!!Please do not purchase. I went through the reviews and even YouTube videos.Hell lot of sweating within 5 mins (I do have heavy face that too with specs), too tight to fit in my head, you cannot play songs at even mid volume - everyone out there will enjoy what songs you are listening to.Music (volume) 1/10Comfort 0/10What else I can say."
1,"I picked up this headphone a few months back seeing all the positive reviews and am giving my review after a few months of usage.The headphones is very good, the audio quality and bass is excellent,  battery backup is excellent, bluetooth connectivity is good, noise cancellation is good because of the tight cushions, the cushions is quite good and i was happy with my purchase. the only disadvantage i noticed initally is my ears tend to get heated up for prolonged usage ie more then 30 minutes.Even after months of usage there is no deterioration of sound or change in cushioning effect.The problem is after a few months the headset itself got loose and i cant seem to keep it around my ears. even a slight tilt of my head causest he headphones to drop off or swivel around my ears. There is no physical damage or cracks in the headphones and its good as new as evident in the picture. Also i have been the only sole user of the headphones and no one else has used it. I have always used it at home and not carried it out.I wish it would have lasted longer then this. My older headphones ( bluedio) lasted for much longer time.  Now looking for a new headphones planning to pick up.Not very happy about as care should be taken for material used to build the headphone also rather then putting all the emphasis on the sound or electronic part."
3,"HiAfter hours charging it shows 90% battery level in Bluetooth details when I connect to mobile.After few hours usage like 4 hours. IT still shows same 90% battery level.What does it mean?Is this product fault or it is normal shows?I need some answers for this, so that I could exchange soon.Except battery level, everything working fine."

The box had manual of headphones, boat products card, warranty card and the headphone (nice looking).When tested, it was comfortable to wear but after 20 minutes, the back of the üëÇ started paining. Have to adjust to it, not a perfect fit/design. The bass was very noticeable. But while playing battle royale games, the 12 starting troubling too much and had to download the equaliser to make it simple but it was again getting unstable after a few minutes and the microphone when we turn on the microphone the audio in the headphone comes with high bass and gets Monostereo which is worst for battle royale multiplayer games. The battery is just awesome after using it for 10 hours the battery was still 60% which is extremely good. Battery life is about 30 hrs with casual usage. the range in a closed area is about 20 feet which is also extremely good but Bluetooth 5.0 is better. I was getting some delay while gaming, about 300ms. Good for online meeting etc but not for gaming. I got it for rupees 1895 which is quite expensive.And I had download the boat lifestyle app to use the Alexa feature with but the headphones but it's just an advertising trick we have to press a button on the app it again and again and we have to also link our account with Amazon which also take some time. The app sometimes does not even detect the headphones and the UI of the app is also not so good."
5,"Amazon delivery service is superb ! Ordered the item late night and received free prime delivery at door step 11:30AM next morning.Pros:1.)Product is having excellent sound quality & Durability. Has premium fit and finish. It's a large headset mostly suited as home entertainment. Available in nice 4 different colours red,blue,orange & Green.2.)Bluetooth connectivity is great having good range and hassle free setup. I could easily pair with my Laptop,Mobile and Ipad covering Windows/Linux/Android and IOS.3.)Sound is crystal clear with no any noise or interference even at max operating distances.4.)In every review I read about the ""ultra-powerful thumping bass"" experience. I was kind of skeptical whether so much bass could be a spoiler. However the output is very adequate with great vocal clarity. I would say perfect. (I am also using original Iphone wired ear buds. Sound quality/bass on it is good as well.5.)Superb battery life. I am using it extensively from the time I received it and looks like battery duration wont be a problem at all. Also it supports Dual mode allowing both wired and wireless. As per specs with a 400mah battery it should fast charge and full charge in 3hrs from any micro USB connector cable.6.)Calls made paired with my oneplus6 mobile were crystal clear without any interference. The built-in mic seems great too.Cons:1.)It's a large headset mostly suited as home entertainment ,I prefer ear buds while travelling or at office.2.)Your ears tend to pain after wearing it for sometime. It's OK though.3.)Sound leaks and is like an external speaker if the volume is above 70%. For this headset I would say the optimal operating volume should be less than 60%, where you can really listen,immerse and enjoy the music.4.)Could be broken/damaged if dropped accidentally from a reasonable height.I liked the product very much and highly recommend if you are looking for near premium/professional Wireless Bluetooth Headphones. Go for it !!!"
5,"The bass and surround sound effect makes you feel comfortable and enjoy music even at high volumes, keeping the noise to the minimum. An excellent product for that price ! totally worth the purchase"
4,"I use it with my MI Note 4, and I've been using it since last two months.Things I found totally satisfying:1) The bass is good.2) Looks quite cool.3) Battery back up is good, I use it for like 1.5-2hrs a day and it works for 3 days generally.4) Noise cancellation is nice, I go for jog in the morning, and travel on Mumbai locals with it on my head.Things I'm not that satisfied with:1) It starts to hurt my ears in like 45mins or something.2) The sound is not that clear and crisp. Product has been emphasised for bass, so the music clarity is a bit bad.One thing I'm really frustrated about:1) I can't keep my phone in my pocket, the connectivity suffers. Many a times, even when I'm holding the phone in my hand, I face a hell of glitches and slurs and stutters and it annoys me hell.It would have been fine if it happened less often, but it happens a bit more than sometimes."
1,The Bluetooth doesn't seem to work properly. Once u connect and just keep the phone 1 feet away the connection is disturbed and u can't listen to songs...not once but i cancelled the product and got a replacement but the same problem with the other new product also...so returned both finally
2,"I got new headphone. Opened and it and connected to system, the left ear piece was not working. Complained to customer through online system. They replaced it with new one. Today only i received the new headphone. Working fine. Will revert with detail review after use.But food for thought, i have seen all these (Irrespective of brand) headphones, the left speaker does not work after some time. Even the wire going to left speaker is intact but still the left side stops working."
2,"Edit: after charging it 4 to 5 times, the charging socket broke off and fell inside the headphones. Now it won't charge. No service centre in Pune so I have to file a claim. Will update once I get a response from the company. Sad, I didn't expect this.Just got these headphones and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised! Sound quality rivals other headphones ten times the price, build and finish is excellent. Yesterday I was listening to music for about four hours and the battery only went down 10 percent. They're very comfortable for long term wear, though they are a bit bulky. They block out noise pretty well too. All in all an A-one product at a very reasonable price."
1,"If you are looking for a product that lasts, do not buy this. This is my 3 Boat product, previously owned two in ear headphones, and this is my third. None of their products last. The 2 in ear headphones last about 6 months each. Initially the product works fine, it provides a really good acoustic experience. With the Rockerz 510, I first had Bluetooth battery charging issues, then the sound began to get distorted and then I raised a ticket and got a replacement. The replaced piece worked for less than a month and the distortion started again and I have to raise a ticket again to get it fixed and all this within 9 months. Also the Audio Cable and Charging Cable quality is just pathetic, I had to replace it with new ones twice."
2,Dont buy it..if you are playing any game like  PUBG it lags audio and it doesn't support sometimes mic while playing PUBG and other thing if you playing PUBG and trying to listen song the audio quality is just like chinese earphones with lots of noise..and it doesn't support multiple things at a time
5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
1,"On very first time after connect with my phone one Right side speaker are not working.Very bed product,Package are broken from inside.Please don't buy cheap items, buy at least modarate items. After reviewing all comments. Don't impress by Hrithik,Go with product quality."
4,Very nice sound quality nd good bass ..nd bass quality nd sound not harmful to hearing ...Very nice üëçüëç
3,"No return option available, placed for replacement.1. Received the product at 12:30pm,tried to turn on but it seems the battery was drained out so put it on charging using cable and power bank.2. Once plugged in, a small red light glows indicating charging process and in 1 hour that turns to blue to show complete of charge.3. At 3:15pm paired it with my phone and started playing PUBG mobile, Bass seems to be high and conversations are audible but not excellent.4. At 3:40pm I start getting ""Battery Low"" announcement during the game and headset shuts down by 3:45pm.5. Kept it for Charge again which took from 4:00pm to 5:00pm to turn blue again.6. At 6:15pm turned on headset and paired it to Phone and started playing songs on Wynk.7. Bass is good and dominated the song while FM is not good based on poor signal reception quality.8. At 6:45pm the battery low notice starts again and shuts down in 2 minutes.Received the replacement, kept the headphones on charge for 1 hour, played songs continuosly for 1 hour battery still shows 70% available. Audio is better than last one(lesser bass). However when connected with Aux cable only one side of headset is audible seems like problem with Aux cable however I can get used to this, Still not totally satisfaction but good buy at rs700-800 price mark."
3,These are my honest review of the Bluetooth headphone after using it for two weeksLet me divide into two categories likes and dislikesNumber 1 likes:-1. The sound quality is average . Bass is moderate overall average in this price category.2. The play pause volume up down button are working fine.3. Battery back up is decent.4. Bluetooth range is good.Dislikes1.You can't use it's for longer period your ears starts to hurt after an hour of usages.2.Takes long to charge.3. Many times there is disturbence in the music while listening as if the Bluetooth connection is getting disconnected and connected automatically.But at this price point it's an average product .
1,"Too bad quality of these headphones. I never think that Zebronics music product quality is like this. I have a Zebronics bluetooth Home theater speaker, only bcz of that quality of speaker I bought the zebronics bluetooth headphone. But this is the poorest quality, also these are too light weight, and the AUX cable is so light. It is like that at any time it can be damaged.I request to all the people plz plz if you are thinking to buy this item,then plz forget this. If you are interested to waste your money then yess you can buy this.But according to me and my family, this is only and only wasting of money."
4,"Good headphone at this price bass is more,moderate and  comfort. Bought at rs.820.Mic issue when on Bluetooth mode."
4,"I purchased Zebronics Zeb-Thunder Wireless Blue Tooth Headphone in March this year from Amazon and delivered to me just 2-3 days before complete lockdown.What it OffersObviously over the ear headphoneIt's Bluetooth and so not wiredIt has a built-in FM Radio (See Con Points)Provision for SD Card to load SongsHands-free phone conversationOperates by a battery and it can be charged via  USB for which USB connector is supplied with the Gadget. Only connector no charger, please.It has a surprising and unique feature that no other Bluetooth headphone offers. It is having provision to connect to a phone or any other music source by wire and the wire is supplied with the gadget besides the charging USB connector. This helps us to continue to listen to music even when the Headphone battery needs a recharge.PROS:Excellent and superb audio quality and plenty of bass and sound which can be adjusted to your liking.Good Design aesthetically made and quite appealing to the eye.Good battery life even when not in use for days togetherBest price and easy on the pocket. Surprisingly priced very low at Rs. 772 from Amazon and it's being shown at Rs. 840- today when I checked just now (10th July 2020).CONS:FM Radio Khas Nahi hai. Its like, Is it available? Yes, available type.I could not tune it to all 10 stations that are available in Hyderabad. Normally, when we opt for FM radio,  one of the stations can be listened to, and to get another station, we need lots of patience. Instead, we can as well switch on FM radio on our phone and get it via blue tooth in the headphones.The FM Stations' reception is very poor and always with the FM noise in the background.Although the Head Phone looks wonderfully giving a very expensive look, I am afraid it may not withstand rough use. No complaints on this count so far in the last 3 months.I load my favorite instrumentals to enjoy crystal clear superb quality audio during my morning walk. I am charging it once a week. When it is paired with your phone, the percentage of charge shows in the Bluetooth interface of the phone. So accordingly, we can decide when to charge.Overall, I give 4 stars out of 5(Because of FM Radio 5th star not given) and recommend for those who keep their electronic gadgets out of the reach of children and use them gently and of course who love music with good quality audio."
5,"Had always known Zebronics to provide quality speakers at fractions of cost of others, and this headset didn't disappoint either. Fits well, looks neat, and sound quality is great and seems well balanced among low-mid-high spectrum. Pleasure to use!"
5,It's amazing with high bass clear sound quality it's totally ossum
5,Like the product as described by the company. The best part is that they are comfortable. I wear them for atleast 3 hours straight sometimes but the don't hurt. AUX cable option is great when the batteries are drained.
5,"Wow! This product is just really amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è. I loved it's sound . It has a feature of extra bass. The most liked feature by me is that it has aux as well as bluetooth. I loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è. Of someone sees my review . I will recommend you to buy this product. It's amazing üëå. If some gamer is seeing this, so I will recommend you to use this product for gaming. It feels like you are in the game when you play any game wearing it. At the end I will only say that I really really really love this product üòç!"
5,"Very Good Product Budget For A Good Affordable Price And Sound Extreme Level As Mobile and PC Computer Good Bass level and Sound Quality.Not displayed battery level in Mobile,Only shown Bluetooth icon,Ear muffs also very good to wear comfort..Overall i satisfy..."
1,"frequent disconnection in charging. The red light gets on for some time while charging and the gets off. Again i take out the charger and insert it. Again the same thing happens over and over again.Sound quality is good, no complainBut charging difficulty is coming very much."
1,I just ordered this product because of good reviews but trust me it's not at all good when it arrived at my place first time its mic was not working properly so I replaced it and the second time when it was delivered it was broken then again when I try to replace it Amazon give me the option for refund so thanks to Amazon for refund.Advice:- Not to buy this product because of cheap rates go for wired headphones at this price they are more good than this product.
5,"The battery lasts a very long time. After a full day's work, battery is at 70% for me. I guess it could last 3 work days if I didn't recharge it daily very light weight no issues with ear pain  cushion is so soft comfort this many features not available Rupees 6000 branded headphones now a days can‚Äôt say more about this product no issues at all g productIf you're an audiophile, or you care about the sound quality, all these headphones are mediocre. They are tuned to the taste of the average consumer - there's a lot of bass andSo far these work great! I'm still concerned about the durability, but I'll also only be using these guys for walks and runs around the city for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, that mitigates the risk of damage."
1,Pathetic I want to return this product but I am not able to as there is no option of return just I can replace.I really don't like the built up quality.Sound quality is also not good.Battery is also not upto the mark after full charge it works only 1:30 hrs.I need money backInfact the box is also damaged and the package came to me was also not packed properly it was also damagedThe product was full of dust as if it feels like it is used product.I have ordered a fresh product it feels like it is used and full of dust
1,Too bad sound quality.no bass sound. Very worst product performance.
5,Product is very cost worthy but the delivery service is very bad....the delivery boy came to my gate shout like a freak and left the box outside gate without making any call.... its slight rain outside and the box was kept outside and delivery boy just ran away... I know one should follow the social distancing in this pandemic period but there is a civilized ways to deliver electronic products especially when there is rain outside.... I have no words to describe the such pathetic way of delivery service.... product is nice but highly disappointed by the Amazon delivery service...
5,"1) micro SD card option of music is the best option to hear it without laptop.2) Battery backup is awesomely good and i use this headphone almost half day nonstop or more but no need to worry for battery level.3)10-12 feet distance no disturbance,4) AUX wire quality is low but working properly.5) material used is feels like of low quality plastic so no idea how long it will run.6) overall i am happy for this product as more than expected good sound quality i got.7) must buy item."
1,"I got this product today. After much anticipation and offer by Amazon, I opened the box and connected it to my android using blue tooth connectivity. Sound is awesome, connected quickly checked with the device volume option, it worked fine. When I wanted to check the volume option from the headphones, I found that the volume down was broken. I changed to FM mode, it did quickly after pressing the play/pause button for a few seconds...I found that the volume was decreasing automatically.... I found that the volume down button is stuck and is pressing the volume on it's own."
1,Pls Don't buy this Zebratronic Thunder  Bluetooth is not getting connected and if at all after much deficultly Disconnects often.  Searching for a service Center and getting it repaired is very deficult since I live in a small town i have to go to a city some 423Km away.  Pls DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT you are throwing your hard earned money in garbage if you go for it.
3,"Update after buying a second one:The first one had the frustrating habit of  switching to FM mode from Bluetooth if I moved my head at times. And the central selector button didnt work. So each time this happened I needed to power off the phones and switch it on again. I thought this was how this product was and was starting to live with it when I decided to gift a friend with a pair. And to my surprise and dismay I found that on the second unit the selector worked fine. And now that the return window is closed, I feel a bit disappointed so I have knocked off a couple of stars from my rating. Buyers check this selector button or you shake your head the female voice in the headphones says ""FM Mode"" and you are hit with deafening static. Shake your head some more and if you are lucky that same voice says ""Bluetooth Mode""All-rounder like Kapil Dev üòÅBluetooth, superb bass, volume control, provision for direct non Bluetooth connect, can play music independent off any other device from a micro SD card , FM radio,Comfortable to wear and audio is excellent.Only thing lacking is provision of a mic to equalise music and conversation.But, I can live with that deficiency."
5,This product give its üíØ many of saying bad battery life but that is not true ihave use this headphones for last 4hours and its 50% Now  so it is nice produce nice quality evwn its ear cushion are also perfect if u want many fearures under 1000 then it is a perfect its connect with bluetooth very easily its is comfartable one of its disapointing this is light plastic use it can break if u dont care of it thanks
5,It's battery üîã Life is Just exellent it has loud speakers üîä that's why you not need to raise volume over 50% and at this volume it easily last 4 days at 2.5-5 hrs of usage...Connectivity is also good you just press power button for 2 second and it starts then it's blue light blinks till it's not connected ...start bluetooth then once you connect manually fron secound time it will connect in less than 30 second...Bass is not too great but very good and clear sound quality at this price point...And what I feel best is supported memory card and also have very DURABLE BUILD QUALITY..... And of course good battery üîã Life...You can buy if your budget is around 600...I got it for 600 rs in sale
5,"I thought it's going to be a light orange but i received a deep red which make.me very happy cause my fav color is red. Ok about the sound stereo windinf id really good, bass are really good but not the best. And it cancel noise really good  perfect for listening music or story without disturbing from around sound. And about bluetooth connect really well backup last longer than i expexted really happy but i don't know how long will that be im talking about the battery backup and one last thing we still can connect with audio jack 3.5 that really helpful if the battery backup out ang specially good for gamer. Almost forget we can control the volume, play pause, next and previous directly from the headphone which is really helpful. I will update about the battery backup later and dont forget u can charge it using mobile charger i.e micro cable charger. U will get the micro cable with this headphone free."
5,I got this Zebronics Thunder for Rs.599 which I would say is an amazing deal and like any other headphone it does has some pro's & consPro's :‚Ä¢ It's really damn cheap 599/- as compared to other wireless headphones.‚Ä¢ The packaging was great.‚Ä¢ Battery back up us preety good 9hrs/per charge and it takes around 2.5 hrs to get it fully charged.‚Ä¢ The ear cups would you a comfory experience.‚Ä¢ The sound quality is pretty good if you listen to songs from Spotify but it lacks lil bass as per me while playing YouTube videos.Con's :‚Ä¢ The build quality seem to be delicate so need to be little extra careful.  Over all I will rate it 4.2/5.
5,"I know there are many bad reviews on this product but this is fantastick.I love listning songs on this and it works great awsm cooolllll and fantstick.Go for it.Don't wait just buy it now. No need to read more reviews just go for this.Go.........It's mic quality is just awsm and stunning.I love its bass.Thank you seller, zebronis and amazon to give me such a great product.It's battery life is just awsm..........."
5,This product is great for this price go using this for 4-5 months now and just works amazing. Bluetooth connectivity is so strong that i can leave my mobile device connected with this headphones at a corner of room and walk around whole house waring these without any issues ( connectivity can easily penetrate 2-3 walls). Don't over charge it 2.5 hours is max. It works perfectly fine otherwise. Most beautiful part it is that it's over ear and soft and comfortable.
5,Used it for 3 weeks and now I am writting this review. Sound quality and bass is good at this price range. Battery life is enough for a day. Wired connection can also be used if the battery is drained. The sd card slot works well. Volume controlls are nice. Noise cancellation is satisfactory.
5,"Wow!. Its amazing guys üòçüòçüòç. Build quality is decent, but the sound quality is Awesome. Deep bass and crystal clear sound. You can hear the each of the instrumental sound in songs. If you are a normal user. Then it is the best choice. But if you are looking for a headphone for gaming, then its not recommended. Because there is some delay in game, while it's connected with blutooth. But if you compromise wireless mode and play games by connecting the 3.5 mm cable, given inside the box. Then you can go for it. Battery backup is also very good üòç"
5,"Pros:Excellent built-in quality.Bass quality is superb.SD card support.Over 8 1/2 hours of battery back.Useful while jogging, walking etc.Comfortable for hearing.Cons:Time delation.Not that good for gaming.  Totally, go for it."
5,"Excellent product for personal use.Lightweight, good battery life, ergonomic, loud, clear, robust, looks trendy.What else do we need ? And all this for a mere ‚Çπ 649 !!!I ordered it for the kids so that I don't mind if they break it, but it eventually ended in my work table due to its wonderful quality. Ordering one more for kids."
1,"Poor packing, when i was received its in very bad condition.Button functioning is not good. Provided aux cable is too bad its not connected well. Once you connect cable only one speaker is running.Now about charging cable its very poor...!!!I strongly suggesting you please go through other headphones...!!!!"
5,Video Player is loading.
5,"This headphone is one of the best headphones I have ever used (in this price segment). Sound clarity and quality is awesome. Bass is moving, and the equalization has been done really good. The best part is the battery backup. It has an amazing battery backup. You can continuously use it for straight 24-28 hours without interruption. I'd recommend this headphone to anyone who wants it in the budget segment. Close your eyes, and go for it!"
5,"Yes good I will recommend it best in listening music , watching videos,mainly playing ping/ free fire best experience.yes it is best in low price for listening üéß online classes.it has both blutooth and wired both with same sound.it us better upto some what I'm noise cancellation while listening music.i kept charging for 3 hours It worked for 4 days(**note** only for online classes daily2hrs)so buy .I bought this item in 600(**best deal of the day**)offer."
5,At first I got a broken damaged product but then I replaced with this red one and I swear this is the best low cost headphones I have ever seen. I had used a lot of products but it has some special specialities...1. Wireless Headphone2. Price is only Rs 800 which comparatively very low to other in market3. Very comfortable to wear and cusions provide xtra comfort.4. It also runs in pc very well with both aux cable and Bluetooth.5. It has also a ad card slot6. It has an inbuilt F.MI am very satisfied. Thank You Amazon. Love You üíï
5,"To begin with I will recommend this product to everyone. Seller is & Amazon is very good in service & Delivery. Product Quality with regard to material, finish is very good. Look wise it is sleek item. Sound is excellent. Controls are very easy. Its On/off & Call pick at side is what it makes it superior among the other headphone. In all a very very good product. One must opt for it. It is VALUE FOR MONEY. If you are looking for HeadPhone go for it."
5,"What I Liked:-Design-Price: I had bought it for 600 rs during flash sale but it is great at normal days price also(800)-Sound quality was greatWhat I disliked:- I could wear it after stretching the size to max. It was fine for me but person with larger face might face difficulty.-Bluetooth connectivity: Once connected, then it didn't bothered at all but it takes some time to connect initially.Overall, the product was great and worth buying. I would definitely buy more as gifts if I got the same offer(600 rs)"
5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.Sound : 5/5Bass :5/5Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)Battery : 4.5/5.  Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.Over all its a good deal @ 699/-Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
5,"I bought 2 of this Bluetooth earphones for me & my friend for our daily workout inside and outside. The earphones fit well as I move around during my workout (sprinting, running, exercising etc...). I've tried similar earphones with similar price points in the past. And, the overall sound quality is well balanced from bass, mid to treble all across compared to others. I liked the light weight element of this product for my purpose and liked the sound quality.Overall, this product is an excellent buy if you are looking for a reasonable price with good quality sports earphones!"
5,"The main thing which I found very fascinating about this ptron tangent beats neckbandis that it's battery backup which was 7-8 hours on watching series and just requires 90-100 mins of charging.As for the sound quality, it is pretty good along with active noise cancellation and good fitting. The bass is also pretty well. Bluetooth connectivity is good with approx 10m of range after that the streaming isn't precise."
5,The product just wonderful Amazing sound quality.fits perfectly in the ear. It is very attractive and useful for me. It has best bass and quality is awesome..good product with price range value for money.battery backup is good..*Overall recommend neckband go for it*...üòòüòò‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
5,"These Bluetooth headsets are great in this range for both use on iOS and Android with quick pairing. The sound quality is very good specially for Bass lovers, and are very comfortable as they are light in weight and you get different sized eartips with them to fit properly in your ear."
5,It is my first Bluetooth Headset.1) Build quality is very good.2) Battery back up is decent.3)Very nice and clear sound quality and Bass is also good.4) You will not feel any pain after a long use of the headset. It is very much comfortable.
5,"I bought these to run and it was important that they be specifically good for running. And they are great. Exceeded my expectations really. The sound quality is excellent. Far better than i'd expected from this price point. And certainly more than enough for my use case. The Bass is great. The design of the earbuds are also great. They don't fall out that often while running. The bluetooth is great. No drops. The battery life is great. Lasts for a few hours comfortably. And most importantly, they are perfectly symmetrical so it feels balanced while running. This is a huge concern and is one of the reasons I went with this design. I have only just bought them. If there are any longevity issues, I shall update this. If there are no updates, assume it was been working great and I've had no complaints!!UPDATE: One of the best purchases I have made. This is perfect. All the sweat and wetness does not seem to bother it. Violent flailing about, if I'm running with them out of my ears, have also not been able to destroy it(yet). The sound quality is as good as wired earbuds twice its cost. Gets as loud as you need. Battery life is more than I expected. Does not fall out of my ears. Perfect fit. The earbud turns off automatically 5 minutes after I disconnect the bluetooth and this is amazing because the only button i have to press is the power on button  and its great for convenience! This is a great product here. I've been using it for about 3 months now and not even one complaint. Good stuff man. Keep it up."
5,"I'm Using This Neckband Headphone For the Last Couple of Days. It Has a New and Eye-catching Design. Besides It Feels Really Nice in Hand and It's Durable, Thanks to Its Excellent Build Quality. It's Pretty Lightweight and Flexible and You Won't Feel You're Using a Neckband. The Earbuds Fit Snugly in Ears and They're Magnetic. There's Some Extra Pair of Eartips in The Box to Choose From. It's Very Comfortable Even For Longer Times of Usage. Battery Life is Nice too. It Offers Upto 6 Hours of Music Playback, That's Really Nice. Latest Bluetooth 5.0 Has Been Used Here That Ensures Longer Range and Stable Connection. It Also Has Quick Pairing and Low Latency Streaming. The Mic Quality is Excellent. On The Right Side There's Three Buttons to Control All The Operations of The Headphone. The Sound is of Very Nice Quality. The Bass is Superb in It. Overall It's a Great in Ear Wireless Bluetooth Neckband. Worth Every Penny."
5,"I like the colour combination as it is different from the same monotonous commonly available black bluetooth neckbands. Another thing that caught my attention are the sleek ear plugs. Wearing earphones for a long time cause my ears to hurt. But the sleek design of this earphones is its biggest advantage as there are no more ear and neck aches. Last but not the least, I loved the audio quality of both calls and media. In this price range, it can give a tough time to more expensive but similar performing Bluetooth earphones."
3,Reviewing this product after one day. Got it for 699 on 6/7 Aug sale. The qc should be done more well as you can see in last pic there are two white spots on the earphone. Sound quality is descent considering the price. Bass is good. Don't expect boAt level bass. But yes it's definitely good. You can feel the thump. Treble is also good. But can find some distortion at full volume. But it nowhere says bluetooth 5.0 on the box and also don't say low latency on the box. Overall decent earphones if you are on budget.
4,Overall good product ....clear vocals but bass slightly lower side....build quality is decent.
1,"The microphone did not work for me with my laptop. It was working ok with my phone, but the microphone voice was a bit low. The device starts complaining about charging when there is about 30 % of charge within two hours of usage with full charge and it lasted around 2-3 hours. Just because the box in which it was delivered was destroyed accidently from my side, I was not able to return or replace the item. I also wrote to them through their site explaining the problems. No response yet I am not sure why it has so high rating, I have decided not to go for any Bluetooth headphones based on such a terrible experience!  They say it has one-year warranty, but they don't even reply to my emails!"
4,"I got it for 799/- within 24 hrs. Using it for 10 days now, don't have much complaints. I will sum up in pros and cons after my experience with the earphones. Reducing 1 star for the first CON in my review below.PROS:1) Cheaper than some of the other earphone brands with 12 months warranty as well.2) Good Audio quality, I found it was better sounding than an Over the Ears Headphones I have from Cosmic Byte (G4000). Clear sound and good audio reproduction.3) Battery life serves good at least for my taste as I am not a heavy user (I generally use it 2hours a day max.). Just FYI, I have charged the earphones twice in 10 days.4) Comfortable earphones with very less weight and good ear fit.5) Mic quality for calls is decent, not much noise cancellation for background noise but whatever is sent through is very clear and accurate.CONS:1) Biggest con for me personally is that I can't watch online youtube or twitch videos with this one (usually have to go 360p or lower for smoother experience) as it hampers the wifi speed on my mobile when connected to the mobile via bluetooth. This is happening because my wifi router is 2.4Ghz and it is interferring with the bluetooth signal to reduce internet speeds. A simple 5Ghz router would solve this issue, but as I don't have it, its become an issue. Also, I can tell if you run videos from mobile internet then you don't face this issue.2) Only SBC bluetooth audio format supported hence not the best audio quality.3) Left and Right ear plugs always confuse me while wearing it on, also the length of left and right side is not exactly the same, slight mismatch is present, which goes to show poor quality checks from the company.4) Battery life could have been better or atleast charge time should have been reduced. It takes 1.5 hrs charge time for 6-8hrs battery life.5) Battery indicator is very wrongly calibrated. From 100 to 70% discharging, it takes 5-6 hrs playtime, while from 70 to 10% it takes just 30 odd minutes. This again shows poor quality checks from the company."
4,"Looks wise: DecentSound quality: GoodNoise cancellation: Great, as compared to many other branded co. bluetooth earphones this product won't disappoint you.Even when you are on a call you can hear the receiver's voice clearly and vice versa.Connectivity: Very easy to connect to your smartphone but you may need to troubleshoot it (mentioned in mannuel) for pairing it with your laptop.Unique part of this product : Extremely flexible and lightweighted.I bought this product for Rs.850 but within 2days the price dropped to Rs.800"
1,Seriously I never seen such worst product even street side product are far better.1. First one I got defective unable to connect to call only songs were audible2.Replaced product battery issue 70% battery drained immediately in 10 minutes time3. U can hear opposite side person voice but they can hear only what they spoke
3,"I'm on a spree for best budget wireless earphones.Looking at all the positive product reviews, i was tempted to go for this one. I agree may be on few points but the main important thing about earphones is that it should sound well in layman terms.the sound feels like someone screaming from an old empty well. you hear them but hardly. if Bass, treble are foreign terminology for you then go for it. You may need to pay attention for the lyrics most of the time."
2,"Based on so many positive reviews, I chose to buy it and initially I too liked the earbuds, but just in two days it went off during a call even though it had 60% battery. I tried to start it but on vain. Later I tried to charge and itscharging socket seemed to have loose connection and it did not start charging. Finally, I had to return it.Other observations:1. Build quality is poor.2. Though description here had mentioned as Bluetooth 5.0 but product box had no mention of the same."
5,"I am a prime customer of Amazon and I always purchase a product after so much research bought these Tron in the sale in and trust me I am blown away by these I have used sony and other headphones in the price range of 5 & 6k but this is just similar to them in this price range ""sound quality"" 10/10 ""battery life"" seems good not tested for as described but will update soon ""durability"" 10/10 perfect fit no pain no discomfort.... Really boat has done a fantastic job with amazing music quality with superb bass in all highs mids &lows ..... Just go for it."
2,"This earphone is the best , and awsome at this price range .This was my thinking before purchasing. But when I purchase this i recieved this in well packed manner. I think this is the best one but when I open It and start testing i found that there is very low vocals hearing and music is too high . The contrast of vocals and music not well , it has difference of land and sky. Build quality is good but the overall sound quality is bad only 2 ratings for sound out of 5."
1,"It is no longer working. How can something stop working in 10 days.  Seriously dont go for it.  Also the emails sent to the customer care is not getting replied. The phone number printed on box uses IVR and it says to submit request on link sent via sms.  No such link arrives..Pure case of selling inferiorproduct with no customer service or honouring of warrantyUpdate.. after writing a mail 10 days ago, i am still waiting for reply to claim my warranty..."
4,So awesome for working out! These stay put my ears while I am sweating on the treadmill. And they are very sound proof. They have many different sizes of the ear pieces so I had one that fit perfectly into my ear.
1,"Took a long time to charge for the first time, lost charge within an hour.It stopped charging within one week - had to send it to the bin."
4,I recently purchased these neckband for my father and it turned out really amazing.Sound quality is Good .Noise Cancellation is perfectly fine.They are light weight and battery backup is  long.It is worth the price product.It makes his job so easy all day.
4,"Dear Friends,I am using this earphone more than 10 days.1. Build Quality is average but compare to this price range ok.2. Call quality and range is 5 out of 53. Bass is low so not suit for bass lovers.4. In packing not mentioned Bluetooth versions.5. Battery charge is good. Up to 4 hrs.Even i have searched many earphones and before this i bought wecool moon walk tws  at 799 based on reviews but music is good but call is worst so that returned and bought this Ptron good product with this price range.Thanks to Amazon."
5,Battery backup is too good
1,"Initially Mic was working pretty fine, after week my voice is too low for the opposite user.Very disappointed. now not able to return as well since the return window is closed just after that the issue started."
5,"This neckband is soo nice, color combination also good,  this price segment is soo better,sound quality is amazing, good battery backup Amazon delivery is soo fast, thanks Amazon"
4,"The earphones look good with a smooth design and finish. However, they're a little delicate where the wires exit from the neckband, one feels if pulled roughly might break them. The buttons in this one (unlike ptron's Tangent Bass Plus design which are raised )are in line with the surface so, it can be hard to get the right button sometimes but that's a personal preference. The bass is quite flat and the treble is a little too high pitched for my liking. So, if you're listening to speech for ex you may find the audio a little sharp but music is fine. The battery is good. The max I've got is 8hrs from it with non-continuous usage. Overall a good buy."
5,"I ordered it just Yesterday, I was finding Some cool neckband with gud quality of audio and sound quality also, some period of Warrenty.I found this brand and also my friend said me to go for this bcoz. Of value for money and Style. I would recommend this earphone bluetooth techno. To use instead of other valuable Neckband this is also comes with Bluetooth 5.0"

1,The only problem I have with this headset is that it doest works while charging.It should be must to work while charging as we have 1.5hr charging time and gives 3-4 backup.
5,product is very good and very flexible the ptron neckband has a very good quality of sound battery backup is very good one time charge and 7-8 hours working easily. Really very good one in reasonable price.. I personally love it a lot totally worth it. Sound quality is also very good
5,"Yes it's sound quality is very good it has noise cancellation which is good to enjoy music, I liked this neck band ,price is also decent."
5,Good quality premium neckband.Superior quality.Sound is seriously awesome at this price range. It even has noise cancellation. And bass quality is also good.Overall good product.Dont think just go for it .You will seriously like it alot
5,"The sound quality of this neckband is perfect.  that it's battery backup which was 7-8 hours on watching series and just requires 1-2 hours of charging.The Earbuds Fit Snugly in Ears and They're Magnetic. There's Some Extra Pair of Eartips in The Box to Choose From.The Bass is great. The design of the earbuds are also great. They don't fall out that often while running.The in line microphone is surprisingly very very clear and the person hearing u will not face any issue,if the mic is at a distance from u also it catches your voice, very good micButtons on the mic are tactile and provides a multifunctional key and volume up down buttons, buttons are very responsive and noise cancellation is good also."
5,Sound quality is excellent I'm very happy this is the best neckband with deep base .Worth money.
5,One of the best in category neckband.Sound and build quality is awesome and battery backup can last upto 2 days.If you are thinking of buying a budget friendly neckband with amazing quality than go for it.
5,I like the product It has good sound quality and bass tooI have used this product for 3 days and by using I get to know that It has good battery back up .The buds are affordable and it is best at this price.Not too heavy light weighted product
1,"Please don't buy! Changed 3 star to 1.After 40 day usage:It got faulty, right earbud is not functioning.As I mentioned below it was replaced once by Amazon, so Ptron is refusing to replace it again.Below is the company's response on a complaint raised by me.""Hi,Thank you for contacting pTron!We would like to inform you that only a one-time replacement can be done against the order. kindly refer to the link https://ptron.in/pages/repair-service-warrantyPlease feel free to contact us for further assistance.Regards,Support Team""************************After 2 weeks of usage:Sound quality & Bluetooth connectivity are good,  but... but, Please THINK before BUY! 3star,1) Battery lasts for hardly 8-10 hours.2) Hardly takes 30 minutes to fully charge, that means the battery capacity is not decent.3) Sometime Media audio doesn't play after switching from call, also Voice over the call disconnects, though the device is connected.4) Till 50% it takes 7-8 hours, but the next 50% takes only 1 hour to complete discharge & off the device.5) Frequently comes out of the ear.6)  I'm not able to find this model on PTron website to register it for the warranty. Older versions are available there.  It seams the site itself is not updated with the product details.*** I have tested 2 different devices by replacing the first one.it means the seller has given the wrong information about it's battery life"
5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).Packing :The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.Box contents :Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).First impression :The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.Buttons :The brick on the right side has the buttons.We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.Connectivity :Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.Battery:The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.Additional features :These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.Sound quality :Sound quality  in these earphones are amazing.The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't  you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.there are no concerns according to me till now .I'll update when something goes wrong.Update !!!So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.Thank you"
5,"I have just received my BoultCurve. Its really awesome, sound quality is soooo good. Out of 5, I will give you 5."
1,Not expected this within use of 20 days the magnetic part is broken and seperated from the speaker .Product is not good according to the price .
5,Wowww!! Just awesome! Totally unexpected good quality..Just keep going no two thoughts about purchasing the headphones! only thing I'm waiting is to know it's durability through days to go!
1,"Why anyone buys a Bluetooth earphone?... So that they can do their work freely while having earphone on. Imagine the voice continuously breaking while you have that plugged into your ears listening to your favorite song.I assure that is one of the most annoying thing you can experience.This is the only issue with the phone...if you are stationary, all ok...In a straight line without anything inbetween the range is 4-5 Metres.Don't even think of jogging with this product.I am editing my comment further after a months use, the connection issue is really troublesome.Even when stationery, it keeps on disconnecting.If your hand comes between the phone and earphone, the voice breaks completely.Never seen anything like that in any wireless earphone before."
1,"Two major issues: 1) Bluetooth connection stability: this device connects instantly but while on the move the audio is constantly  interrupted. Even if I  keep my hand on the pocket the phone is kept, it interrupts audio (while walking). And not only for few seconds, but it keep on interrupting through out my walk. If I'm using it with the phone in front of me it's awesome, but not at all good while walking.2) Direction of sound: It lacks a very fundamental concept of direction of sound. Left earpiece produces sound coming from right and vice versa. First I had doubt, while playing game. Later on checked using 5d sound test and now confirmed that both earpiece produces sound coming from opposite direction. Left earpiece produces sound coming from right and Right earpiece produces sound coming from left.Used this device for approximately a week.I am writing this review after I placed a replace request. I would try the replaced set and if the issue remains same, I would like a refund.Received the replacement and found same issue with the replaced set too.Update: I requested a refund of the replaced product. Delivery boy collect the product from me...... now after some day, when I enquired about my refund, to my surprise I got to know that the seller updated amazon that I returned a non amazon product........Update: I have not yet received my refund and Amazon says they are still working on the matter.Update: the issue is now resolved and the refund is processed by Amazon."
1,"Sound quality is good , but bloototh not working properly ,Working only 3 ft, after 3 ft bloototh voice quality disconnected so poor wireless device"
1,"Very bad to start with cons as I don't find any single prosCons: - Battery Draining Too quickly, Within 1hr call at volume level 80, battery drastically dropped from 100 to 80.- Sound distorting when we walk or riding a bike or when we stand near traffic.- Left side ear tip keep on falling, not a perfect fit.- Vibration is very cheap as a Chinese phone- i don't think noise cancellation is there in this device. even in a quiet environment, its too noisy at the other end of the phone call.- Manufacturer not mentioned anything about ip rating and water resistance in the box or manual. but seller posting wrong information in the listing. i have even checked with boult audio website, there is no evidence about water resistance.- no bass at all. even treble is not calibrated rightly sound is too shrilling.- Too Light, it will fly away when you ride a motorcycle with this Boult Audio CurveI had used Soundpeats Q900 and Samsung Level U in my past. Soundpeats have top class experience, Samsung reasonably a good alternative. I bought boult audio curve after seeing a lot of good reviews. but really disappointed purchase. item got delivered today. I requested return and asked for refund same day. this feel like a cheap product which sells less than Rs.500/-"
5,Update after 9 months usage- This really awesome Bluetooth for the price range and music connectivity is truly amazing and I'm using it on daily basis it's very comfortable and durable as well. Totally I have 4 device's of same within my family and friends. This is really outstanding headset I had ever had .... Must have for all . Best in class üëåJanuary update -I have been using the bluetooth device from 2 days . I haven't charged and used for about an 7-8hrs that's great for any device for me till now ..Little bit doubtful on durability and built quality apart from that I haven't found anything yet to say it as con's .But it's really helpful if you buying this for calls and music it is good to hear from the small ND awesome ear pieces...Totally budget gadget in decent price with awesome performance üëå
2,"The best part about this product was the ease it brought in my life. I literally wore it entire day and even during workout as it settles down around the neck quite easily.The battery backup has been good so far in 3 months of usage. 12+ hours of usage in one full charge. Looks decent, not very premium but sturdy and is comfortable to wear. Fits snugly in the ear. The sound quality is clear and crisp.About the cons, it is not really for an audiophile as it has hardly any bass. Noise cancellation could have been better but it is still decent. As many have mentioned, the connection gets distorted in a crowd or when I move 10+ feet away from the phone.Edit - The ear plug on the left side has come out after 2 months of use and they have not given any replacement. Recently I have discovered that the after sales support for this product is non-existent. The customer care helpline never responds and I have called 100 times. Don't buy because there is no credibility in the brand. It is like any other local produce and warranty means nothing. Risky proposition!"
5,"Excellent product... I was never expecting this premium quality headset with this price segment..Design and build quality:- looks are very premium and light when you wear it. Its very much flexible  and buttons are well responsive.""Sound quality"":- really sound quality was very impressive and clear ...bass is great but not the best... it's very loud if you hear it with 100% volume...but for better experience use it 50-60% volumeBattery life :- coming to battery  it's really great...it will last upto 6-7hrs if you listen it with 60-70% volume... charging time is around 1hr 40minsConnectivity is fine within 15ft distance..Finally it's really good ""value for money"" if you're interested go for it without wasting time... thumbs up Boult curve üëåüëåüëç"
2,Product quality is good.sound is also good bass and mids are ok...but there are connectivity issues ...if u r in crowded place it will loose connections and sound on every sec...and u will not here sing beat even phone is in ur pocket  doesn't matter....connections is not good...that is the main reason.....u should  not go for it......even while walking  u can have some glitch in sounds.......always go for csr compatible earphones.......
5,"I've been using it from weeks now and I think now is the time to give a review. I can tell you this that only weight you feel on your ears is of the sound of music, it is light as feather and battery life is amazing (I used it for more than 12 hours (5,6 hours ideal). Sound quality is good and I mostly use this for multiple devices and with my laptop it feels like its the best fit than wireheadphones. And for the price they are offering,  this can't get any better. I'll recommend this product."
1,"I have owned and currently own a lot of good speakers, headphones and earphones. My previous Bluetooth earphones suddenly stopped working and i was seeing a lot of ads by boult and so i decided to give them a try. The first pair i bought sounded better however had a problem where the Bluetooth would stop for a second and resume on its own automatically and so i got a replacement today. The second pair while doesnt have any problems, they do sound terrible. The audio quality is nowhere near the competition and they have no bass at all. The audio is very high pitched for some reason. The only good thing about the earphones is the build. While the durability is a bit flimsy the design is good. Wouldnt recommend buying them though."
1,"Just checked these earphones, Here are few points that i want to make so that buyers doesn't get fooled by discount.1.Over priced2.inflated MRP to lure people by giving huge discount.3. I didn't like bluetooth connectivity, as sound drops even if you are 5 feet away from phone4. Plastic used is so cheap, doesn't feel like 4500/- earphones5. Wire of both buds is so thin, it seems very fragile, hope it doesn't get in hands of children otherwise surely you will regret it.6. Sound quality is not that adequate, i have wired jbl earphones which i bought for just 700 are way better than this.Suggestion for makers, don't play cheap gimmicks to sell stuff by inflating MRP and than giving big discount, you could have done better than this.I got trapped in discount. Hope others will not make same mistake as i did.Have a good day."
3,"This product has quiet balanced sound in terms treble and bass and has good noise isolation.Battery life is good and currently using for last 6 hours continuously and has not lasted still.I am a big bass lover and need little more enhanced bass for my requirements, but this one has balanced one.I hope this review will help for your purchase."
2,"Don't know, who is giving a 5-star rating. Fooling peoples. managed reviews.I never write so bad review of any product if it just OK.But this is the worst.Worst connectivity issue.Even if you don't move, even if you are watching the movie on PC form mere 1-foot distance, still it stutters. The issue in connectivity. You can't imagine when you are riding on a bike or you are moving or jogging. Third class connectivity. When there is such problem, what is the use of all that Music quality and durability?Simple logic is, do not buy. Go for a branded product of instead there are Zoook in same price point."
1,"Got defected with in 1month,Sound clarity is very poor,Network problem found even the phone is in pocket,Automatically connecting disconnecting even during calls and watching videos.Waste of money."
4,"I will tell you my experience of 60 daysFor sound quality: No doubt .. it's good but when it comes to grip around neck.. it's very irritating sometimes. initially the range was good but late ri noticed that when i listen music while walking..continous disturbanxe will be there.. Also one most negative impacy is ..you can't bplay PUBG wearing it lol...sound comes little bit late..So i will say, if your budget is tigt this is much better optionbattery and charging wise it's average..not bad neither too good..but very decent.After 1 year of use I will say if you want to buy it better go for true wireless ones as this one will cause problem as having neck  band has its own disadvantages and its range is also reduced compare  to prior."
1,The audio play supposed to play on left ear piece work on right and vice versa. Effect on picture moving from left give right ear.
3,"Updated review after using it for working out:Whilst using the headphones during jogging and working out, noted that there was a lot of jitter/break in the sound and also the earphones kept coming out. Tried changing the earbuds but was not of much use. Hence reverting to my older wired BoAT headphonesDecent pair of headphones. Was able to pair to my Moto Z Play without much fuss and was fairly straightforward. Music playback is decent - bass is OK and not exceptional. Call quality is OK. Have not yet tried out the headphones while jogging or working out and hence unsure as to how they would behave when subject to constant movement and vibration. Not yet assessed battery life either"
1,"Hi,I wish if I could give it a 0 star.Pros: Amazon Deliver  Good Sound Quality  Battery BackupCons : Blue Tooth Connectivy  Pathetic Call QualityThe most important part neglected in the design in Bluetooth connectivity. I tried both with my Samsung and Mi phones.If phone is in your pocket and you are working out then Bluetooth will disconnect intermittently. Moreover, you will notice a lag of 2 seconds on a call.I am not able to return the product but I have an option of replacement. Replacement I don't want because other reviews also tells the same story. All in All, please do not buy."
1,"Product sound and battery life is awesome. here i am giving 1 star because my needs not fulfilled by this product. i brought this specially for running and walking but this product connectivity issue is very worst. if we put mobile in pocket then connectivity issues get started. also vibration voice is really irritating .Device cover only 4 to 5 ft of range only. if any disturbance come between this then sound quality affected.I like product design, sound and specially Bass effect is mindblowing, battery life is also gud.Suggestion : Boult should work on bluetooth connectivity issue."
1,I received a damaged product. The outer cover was scratched. I opened with hope that it would be worth spending Rs.1300 but as i opened the box i found it very dusty. Metallic earpiece was scratched. It appeared like a local product. Very cheap quality. sound was also breaking with 1 side. I didn't find any option of replacement so i am returning it. Plz do not believe blindly on reviews.
1,Returning the product just after use of. 5 hours.The sound quality is good but the earplugs are pretty uncomfortable.The battery life is good but the quality of the band is not upto the price.The quality of the Bluetooth connection is very poor.  It couldnot even withstand the 2 mtr space. Between phone n earphones.The quality of the packaging was poor it was all messed up. Please do not buy this product its not worth wasting your money.  The mai point of returning this product is uncomfortable earplugs & very very poor Bluetooth connection.
1,Not Satisfied..I hardly used it 2-3 times and the battery is not charging. I charged it for 2-3 hours but battery is still 40%. Tried another charger and cable still the same. Even though it shows red light for charging but it doesn't charge over 40%. Really disappointed. The return window on amazon closed just 3 days ago. It has just been 15 days since I got the delivery..waste of money. I don't know what to do and how to claim warranty.
2,"Highly advertised below average product for the price.Sound quality is average , no great grip on ears especially if your are working out in gyms or thread mills.Sound breaks when there are some obstacles between mobile and headset,quite annoying in gym environment.Call sometimes break although can be managed.Battery backup is pretty average.Worst thing is customer care is pathetic.No response for tickets raised ,even after 10-15 days!!!! They call you as soon as you register the product for warranty and requests for 5 star rating and offer you some rewards and after that you will ignored !"
1,"The product stopped working after six months. When I tried contacting the service center for registering a complaint firstly they never pick our calls. And then they asked me to send the product with all its accessories. So I did. They took more than two weeks just to process my product. Since my device was still in warranty I asked them to provide a replacement but they provided me with refurbished device and that too without any of my accessories. This refurbished device has a very bad sound quality, low battery life. Now they are not at all replying to  any of my queries.I recommend not to buy this worst product."
1,"Not a good product as expected after viewing the details and performance comparison.Bluetooth is not having good connectivitySound quality is good but only when mobile is in your hand.Connectivity is not good when mobile is in your pocket or 5 feet away from the gadget.You can not do the running or jogging while using this, connectivity issues are their if you are just walking or even little movement can crack the voice or sound ....Auto disconnecte some time during activity like exercise or yoga.......  Not solve the purpose"
1,Although the sound is good but the product is extremely unreliable and non durable. It keeps getting disconnected continuously after every 5 seconds. The Bluetooth range is also extremely poor.At this price its a waste of money.The worst part being that when you try to return this it only gives you the option of replacement and not refund. This is just a horrible strategy to force customers to use such poor products.
1,"The product I received had huge problems with bluetooth connectivity. The range said in the product description is 10m. Well... It didn't even connect properly in 4m range. Even for the slightest movements of the headset, there were disconnection/brake in audio. I don't know if my product is alone like this or it is the general case. There wasn't an option to return. Hence, I have requested a replacement. I will update my review once i receive the replacement. Till then i wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this.EDIT: The replacement arrived. No improvement. In fact, now it has physical damage. Now returning it."
2,"This is not good for talking on phone, it has good speaker but bad mic. Noise cancellation is bad, so not good while talking on mobile. However, its OK to use on computers online meeting.The bass is nice, battery life is amazing. look is decent.I am not recommending this for those who want to use for talking on mobile."

1,"Purchased this headset after looking at all the positive reviews. It lived up to the expectations with good sound and bass quality & batter power (5+ hours). All these were short lived, within a month of usage it stopped charging properly. While charging it would turn to blue very quickly (30+ minutes) and if you remove from charging it would hold charge for few minutes and Bluetooth gets disconnected.Since the return period is over, reached out to Boult based on the 1 year warranty provided. They suggested to raise a ticket and then to send the faulty product to a New Delhi address. Its been couple of weeks, waiting with fingers crossed to get an update. Its a bit frustrating and not sure whether anyone wants to be in this state after spending good amount for the head set.Update : Got the new one nearly after a month of follow ups. The returned one also is a refurbished one and stopped working within a week. Again the cycle of returning and getting back started. Lot of time and effort wasted. The third product also stopped working within a month. Its not worth to spend this much time and effort and so stopped chasing Boult.May this company is not for me. Will not buy any Boult products anymore."
1,"Edited 29.07.20I wrote to Support on the Boult website. I got a call asking me to delete this review. They asked me to send it for repair, which I sent at my own expense, enclosing the extra ear protectors and the charging cable. After a week I got the piece back, but without a charging cable or the extra ear protectors. I've plugged it in to charge using my own cables, it is not charging. The LED light does not turn on, nor does the piece work. I do not know what they are trying to do.Initial review:As far as the sound quality was concerned, this was fine. I'm not interested in bass and things like that so I cannot comment.The product came to me in a resealed box and without the one page manual. However, it worked after I charged it so I didn't complain. Last night I connected it to my laptop to charge.This morning I tried switching it on. After the voice saying ""Power on"", there was a sparking sound and now it is dead and does not turn on. When I plug it in there is no LED light.I'm very disappointed."
5,"Good call connectivity. great expericance during calls in terms of connectivity, voice quality and neckband controls for calls.Music experience was also very decent. I liked the overall sound quality & the bass of the product.Build quality is also fantastic.Very satisfactory purchase..Highly recommended..Don't be hesitate.. Go and hit the buy button.."

3,I have searched too many bluetooth headphone and earphone lastly I used Boat Rockerz 510 bluetooth headset thats was so big for me to carry any where and then I bought this one .Everything is awesomeSound Quality::- 10-9.9 slightly disappointed because i have use Boat Headphone .Battery ::--10-10Body material:-10-9Connectivity::--10-9 not too bad but a little bit lags sometimes but Range is about 10 ftComfort:--10-10 Easily hangs on your neck and feels zero weight because of its light weight.Overall a nice product Go For ItWorth it because of its price that I have bought it in ‚Çπ1299
1,"Alert Alert AlertAfter sale service is sooo pathetic even more when one have to bear the cost to put it on course to service centre.If they don't listen you easily than use twitter handle......When you don't get proper after sale service than it is better to drop it outAfter almost 9 month of purchase I am writing this review.The sound is good even bass but need to change your sound setting manually , if u use it continuously it gives you 5 to 6 hour play, battery plays a good role, flexible, easy to fit.The bad thing is its got faulty two times and we need to send it back to the customer centre, u have no access at the service station, after submission, you will get it repaired (not replaced) and they will send it back at per your complain form address.Got it repaired for the third time but still not working.Had to bear the sending cost to the service centre.It's so irritating having regard to the competency of the service centre."
5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
1,"On very first time after connect with my phone one Right side speaker are not working.Very bed product,Package are broken from inside.Please don't buy cheap items, buy at least modarate items. After reviewing all comments. Don't impress by Hrithik,Go with product quality."
4,Very nice sound quality nd good bass ..nd bass quality nd sound not harmful to hearing ...Very nice üëçüëç
3,"No return option available, placed for replacement.1. Received the product at 12:30pm,tried to turn on but it seems the battery was drained out so put it on charging using cable and power bank.2. Once plugged in, a small red light glows indicating charging process and in 1 hour that turns to blue to show complete of charge.3. At 3:15pm paired it with my phone and started playing PUBG mobile, Bass seems to be high and conversations are audible but not excellent.4. At 3:40pm I start getting ""Battery Low"" announcement during the game and headset shuts down by 3:45pm.5. Kept it for Charge again which took from 4:00pm to 5:00pm to turn blue again.6. At 6:15pm turned on headset and paired it to Phone and started playing songs on Wynk.7. Bass is good and dominated the song while FM is not good based on poor signal reception quality.8. At 6:45pm the battery low notice starts again and shuts down in 2 minutes.Received the replacement, kept the headphones on charge for 1 hour, played songs continuosly for 1 hour battery still shows 70% available. Audio is better than last one(lesser bass). However when connected with Aux cable only one side of headset is audible seems like problem with Aux cable however I can get used to this, Still not totally satisfaction but good buy at rs700-800 price mark."
3,These are my honest review of the Bluetooth headphone after using it for two weeksLet me divide into two categories likes and dislikesNumber 1 likes:-1. The sound quality is average . Bass is moderate overall average in this price category.2. The play pause volume up down button are working fine.3. Battery back up is decent.4. Bluetooth range is good.Dislikes1.You can't use it's for longer period your ears starts to hurt after an hour of usages.2.Takes long to charge.3. Many times there is disturbence in the music while listening as if the Bluetooth connection is getting disconnected and connected automatically.But at this price point it's an average product .
1,"Too bad quality of these headphones. I never think that Zebronics music product quality is like this. I have a Zebronics bluetooth Home theater speaker, only bcz of that quality of speaker I bought the zebronics bluetooth headphone. But this is the poorest quality, also these are too light weight, and the AUX cable is so light. It is like that at any time it can be damaged.I request to all the people plz plz if you are thinking to buy this item,then plz forget this. If you are interested to waste your money then yess you can buy this.But according to me and my family, this is only and only wasting of money."
4,"Good headphone at this price bass is more,moderate and  comfort. Bought at rs.820.Mic issue when on Bluetooth mode."
4,"I purchased Zebronics Zeb-Thunder Wireless Blue Tooth Headphone in March this year from Amazon and delivered to me just 2-3 days before complete lockdown.What it OffersObviously over the ear headphoneIt's Bluetooth and so not wiredIt has a built-in FM Radio (See Con Points)Provision for SD Card to load SongsHands-free phone conversationOperates by a battery and it can be charged via  USB for which USB connector is supplied with the Gadget. Only connector no charger, please.It has a surprising and unique feature that no other Bluetooth headphone offers. It is having provision to connect to a phone or any other music source by wire and the wire is supplied with the gadget besides the charging USB connector. This helps us to continue to listen to music even when the Headphone battery needs a recharge.PROS:Excellent and superb audio quality and plenty of bass and sound which can be adjusted to your liking.Good Design aesthetically made and quite appealing to the eye.Good battery life even when not in use for days togetherBest price and easy on the pocket. Surprisingly priced very low at Rs. 772 from Amazon and it's being shown at Rs. 840- today when I checked just now (10th July 2020).CONS:FM Radio Khas Nahi hai. Its like, Is it available? Yes, available type.I could not tune it to all 10 stations that are available in Hyderabad. Normally, when we opt for FM radio,  one of the stations can be listened to, and to get another station, we need lots of patience. Instead, we can as well switch on FM radio on our phone and get it via blue tooth in the headphones.The FM Stations' reception is very poor and always with the FM noise in the background.Although the Head Phone looks wonderfully giving a very expensive look, I am afraid it may not withstand rough use. No complaints on this count so far in the last 3 months.I load my favorite instrumentals to enjoy crystal clear superb quality audio during my morning walk. I am charging it once a week. When it is paired with your phone, the percentage of charge shows in the Bluetooth interface of the phone. So accordingly, we can decide when to charge.Overall, I give 4 stars out of 5(Because of FM Radio 5th star not given) and recommend for those who keep their electronic gadgets out of the reach of children and use them gently and of course who love music with good quality audio."
5,"Had always known Zebronics to provide quality speakers at fractions of cost of others, and this headset didn't disappoint either. Fits well, looks neat, and sound quality is great and seems well balanced among low-mid-high spectrum. Pleasure to use!"
5,It's amazing with high bass clear sound quality it's totally ossum
5,Like the product as described by the company. The best part is that they are comfortable. I wear them for atleast 3 hours straight sometimes but the don't hurt. AUX cable option is great when the batteries are drained.
5,"Wow! This product is just really amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è. I loved it's sound . It has a feature of extra bass. The most liked feature by me is that it has aux as well as bluetooth. I loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è. Of someone sees my review . I will recommend you to buy this product. It's amazing üëå. If some gamer is seeing this, so I will recommend you to use this product for gaming. It feels like you are in the game when you play any game wearing it. At the end I will only say that I really really really love this product üòç!"
5,"Very Good Product Budget For A Good Affordable Price And Sound Extreme Level As Mobile and PC Computer Good Bass level and Sound Quality.Not displayed battery level in Mobile,Only shown Bluetooth icon,Ear muffs also very good to wear comfort..Overall i satisfy..."
1,"frequent disconnection in charging. The red light gets on for some time while charging and the gets off. Again i take out the charger and insert it. Again the same thing happens over and over again.Sound quality is good, no complainBut charging difficulty is coming very much."
1,I just ordered this product because of good reviews but trust me it's not at all good when it arrived at my place first time its mic was not working properly so I replaced it and the second time when it was delivered it was broken then again when I try to replace it Amazon give me the option for refund so thanks to Amazon for refund.Advice:- Not to buy this product because of cheap rates go for wired headphones at this price they are more good than this product.
5,"The battery lasts a very long time. After a full day's work, battery is at 70% for me. I guess it could last 3 work days if I didn't recharge it daily very light weight no issues with ear pain  cushion is so soft comfort this many features not available Rupees 6000 branded headphones now a days can‚Äôt say more about this product no issues at all g productIf you're an audiophile, or you care about the sound quality, all these headphones are mediocre. They are tuned to the taste of the average consumer - there's a lot of bass andSo far these work great! I'm still concerned about the durability, but I'll also only be using these guys for walks and runs around the city for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, that mitigates the risk of damage."
1,Pathetic I want to return this product but I am not able to as there is no option of return just I can replace.I really don't like the built up quality.Sound quality is also not good.Battery is also not upto the mark after full charge it works only 1:30 hrs.I need money backInfact the box is also damaged and the package came to me was also not packed properly it was also damagedThe product was full of dust as if it feels like it is used product.I have ordered a fresh product it feels like it is used and full of dust
1,Too bad sound quality.no bass sound. Very worst product performance.
5,Product is very cost worthy but the delivery service is very bad....the delivery boy came to my gate shout like a freak and left the box outside gate without making any call.... its slight rain outside and the box was kept outside and delivery boy just ran away... I know one should follow the social distancing in this pandemic period but there is a civilized ways to deliver electronic products especially when there is rain outside.... I have no words to describe the such pathetic way of delivery service.... product is nice but highly disappointed by the Amazon delivery service...
5,"1) micro SD card option of music is the best option to hear it without laptop.2) Battery backup is awesomely good and i use this headphone almost half day nonstop or more but no need to worry for battery level.3)10-12 feet distance no disturbance,4) AUX wire quality is low but working properly.5) material used is feels like of low quality plastic so no idea how long it will run.6) overall i am happy for this product as more than expected good sound quality i got.7) must buy item."
1,"I got this product today. After much anticipation and offer by Amazon, I opened the box and connected it to my android using blue tooth connectivity. Sound is awesome, connected quickly checked with the device volume option, it worked fine. When I wanted to check the volume option from the headphones, I found that the volume down was broken. I changed to FM mode, it did quickly after pressing the play/pause button for a few seconds...I found that the volume was decreasing automatically.... I found that the volume down button is stuck and is pressing the volume on it's own."
1,Pls Don't buy this Zebratronic Thunder  Bluetooth is not getting connected and if at all after much deficultly Disconnects often.  Searching for a service Center and getting it repaired is very deficult since I live in a small town i have to go to a city some 423Km away.  Pls DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT you are throwing your hard earned money in garbage if you go for it.
3,"Update after buying a second one:The first one had the frustrating habit of  switching to FM mode from Bluetooth if I moved my head at times. And the central selector button didnt work. So each time this happened I needed to power off the phones and switch it on again. I thought this was how this product was and was starting to live with it when I decided to gift a friend with a pair. And to my surprise and dismay I found that on the second unit the selector worked fine. And now that the return window is closed, I feel a bit disappointed so I have knocked off a couple of stars from my rating. Buyers check this selector button or you shake your head the female voice in the headphones says ""FM Mode"" and you are hit with deafening static. Shake your head some more and if you are lucky that same voice says ""Bluetooth Mode""All-rounder like Kapil Dev üòÅBluetooth, superb bass, volume control, provision for direct non Bluetooth connect, can play music independent off any other device from a micro SD card , FM radio,Comfortable to wear and audio is excellent.Only thing lacking is provision of a mic to equalise music and conversation.But, I can live with that deficiency."
5,This product give its üíØ many of saying bad battery life but that is not true ihave use this headphones for last 4hours and its 50% Now  so it is nice produce nice quality evwn its ear cushion are also perfect if u want many fearures under 1000 then it is a perfect its connect with bluetooth very easily its is comfartable one of its disapointing this is light plastic use it can break if u dont care of it thanks
5,It's battery üîã Life is Just exellent it has loud speakers üîä that's why you not need to raise volume over 50% and at this volume it easily last 4 days at 2.5-5 hrs of usage...Connectivity is also good you just press power button for 2 second and it starts then it's blue light blinks till it's not connected ...start bluetooth then once you connect manually fron secound time it will connect in less than 30 second...Bass is not too great but very good and clear sound quality at this price point...And what I feel best is supported memory card and also have very DURABLE BUILD QUALITY..... And of course good battery üîã Life...You can buy if your budget is around 600...I got it for 600 rs in sale
5,"I thought it's going to be a light orange but i received a deep red which make.me very happy cause my fav color is red. Ok about the sound stereo windinf id really good, bass are really good but not the best. And it cancel noise really good  perfect for listening music or story without disturbing from around sound. And about bluetooth connect really well backup last longer than i expexted really happy but i don't know how long will that be im talking about the battery backup and one last thing we still can connect with audio jack 3.5 that really helpful if the battery backup out ang specially good for gamer. Almost forget we can control the volume, play pause, next and previous directly from the headphone which is really helpful. I will update about the battery backup later and dont forget u can charge it using mobile charger i.e micro cable charger. U will get the micro cable with this headphone free."
5,I got this Zebronics Thunder for Rs.599 which I would say is an amazing deal and like any other headphone it does has some pro's & consPro's :‚Ä¢ It's really damn cheap 599/- as compared to other wireless headphones.‚Ä¢ The packaging was great.‚Ä¢ Battery back up us preety good 9hrs/per charge and it takes around 2.5 hrs to get it fully charged.‚Ä¢ The ear cups would you a comfory experience.‚Ä¢ The sound quality is pretty good if you listen to songs from Spotify but it lacks lil bass as per me while playing YouTube videos.Con's :‚Ä¢ The build quality seem to be delicate so need to be little extra careful.  Over all I will rate it 4.2/5.
5,"I know there are many bad reviews on this product but this is fantastick.I love listning songs on this and it works great awsm cooolllll and fantstick.Go for it.Don't wait just buy it now. No need to read more reviews just go for this.Go.........It's mic quality is just awsm and stunning.I love its bass.Thank you seller, zebronis and amazon to give me such a great product.It's battery life is just awsm..........."
5,This product is great for this price go using this for 4-5 months now and just works amazing. Bluetooth connectivity is so strong that i can leave my mobile device connected with this headphones at a corner of room and walk around whole house waring these without any issues ( connectivity can easily penetrate 2-3 walls). Don't over charge it 2.5 hours is max. It works perfectly fine otherwise. Most beautiful part it is that it's over ear and soft and comfortable.
5,Used it for 3 weeks and now I am writting this review. Sound quality and bass is good at this price range. Battery life is enough for a day. Wired connection can also be used if the battery is drained. The sd card slot works well. Volume controlls are nice. Noise cancellation is satisfactory.
5,"Wow!. Its amazing guys üòçüòçüòç. Build quality is decent, but the sound quality is Awesome. Deep bass and crystal clear sound. You can hear the each of the instrumental sound in songs. If you are a normal user. Then it is the best choice. But if you are looking for a headphone for gaming, then its not recommended. Because there is some delay in game, while it's connected with blutooth. But if you compromise wireless mode and play games by connecting the 3.5 mm cable, given inside the box. Then you can go for it. Battery backup is also very good üòç"
5,"Pros:Excellent built-in quality.Bass quality is superb.SD card support.Over 8 1/2 hours of battery back.Useful while jogging, walking etc.Comfortable for hearing.Cons:Time delation.Not that good for gaming.  Totally, go for it."
5,"Excellent product for personal use.Lightweight, good battery life, ergonomic, loud, clear, robust, looks trendy.What else do we need ? And all this for a mere ‚Çπ 649 !!!I ordered it for the kids so that I don't mind if they break it, but it eventually ended in my work table due to its wonderful quality. Ordering one more for kids."
1,"Poor packing, when i was received its in very bad condition.Button functioning is not good. Provided aux cable is too bad its not connected well. Once you connect cable only one speaker is running.Now about charging cable its very poor...!!!I strongly suggesting you please go through other headphones...!!!!"
4,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.sound quality is excellent,very clear and loud,bass levels are great.tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoySingh Sujeet"
3,"These are about average headphones. The build quality is ok.I did not quite measure the battery backup time, but it usually lasts me for a couple of days with intermittent use for music and youtube videos.The headphones work well with the aux cable.There is a distinct lag when watching videos with the headphones in Bluetooth mode.The sound is clear and balanced. Bass is not heavily boosted.The microphone is not quite effective for calls. The people who I spoke to on phone, using these headphones, gave feedback that my voice was very low and with some distortion.The earmuffs are ok, but I would have preferred them to be a bit larger. They did not cover my ears completely, so I found the earphones somewhat uncomfortable after an hour and half of continuous use."
1,it is so hard on ears and after 5 to 10 minutes you will feel the pain irrespective of your head size.
3,"Build quality looks below average, the aux & charging cable provided with the headphones are of poor quality. Sound is just okay and bluetooth works just fine.I dont think they are gonna last very long. I'm not even sure if they are worth ‚Çπ700."
1,Sound quality not upto the mark. No balance between vocal and bass. Feels like Noisy audio.Bluetooth mode have lag when playing games(not in milliseconds it produces 2 sec lag).Lag doesn't comes when aux is connected.Mic doesn't work when Aux cable connected. They should have provided aux cable with mic.This design gives more pain to ear. Ear can touch inside parts and it irritates. Cushions not good or big enough to give space between ear and headphones.Once you connected via bluetooth no way to unpair from the headphone. You must turn off bluetooth on mobile/pc inorder to connect another device within the range.So Finally I returned this product.
1,"- Power button got stuck inside. Could not operate.- Adjustable band was just too tight and was not working, was scared while pulling/pushing that it might break.- Volume-up/Volume-down/Play-Pause buttons did not work.- Mic did not work, other was person was barely able to hear with lot of noise.- Over the ear/head it was just too tight/heavy.- Because of above problems, requested for replacement. But, replacement sent by seller was used product in used box with missing aux cable and usb cable. Box was cello-taped (original packaging was missing). Amazon packing was also broken/tampered with.- Had to request for replacement/order cancellation.- Delivery person was kind enough to accept return. And, Amazon was kind enough to consider case and issue refund.- Overall good experience with Amazon & Delivery person. But, product was not good quality (although it was listed as best seller) and seller did not do good thing in sending used product as replacement."
1,"Update after 20 days use, daily for about 3 hours: the headset shows 'Fully Charged' after 2 minutes charging. Goes back to Zero charge after 5 minutes usage.Clearly, the chargeable battery is old, depleted. Since the problem came up only after 20 days - and suddenly, the Return Window is also over.Amazon, you shouldn't sell such products, it's tantamount to cheating!! Do you have a solution for me???Bottom Line: give the money to someone who needs it. Buying this product is like burning your money!"
5,Studio over sounds like boomClear soundBass is exact with songFit with earsLooks coolNoticed  faster contectivity
1,"Sound good but very low ,pathetic for calling hoens sound every 3 sec . Only for listning music not for calling purpose."
1,Recieved a damaged piece. First it shows 90% battery then 40 in 5 minutes. One side works well another side is not working properly. After 2 hrs Bluetooth connectivity has been stopped working. Aux cable is working but one ear only . Hope they send me another good one after returning this .
4,"I had bought this for my daughter's online classes but used for a day to evaluate and mostly very pleased with my purchase.Call Quality: Receiving calls and sound on the other side was good. In fact, there was good ambient noise cancellation. While taking a call and opening the tap in the kitchen, the other side couldn't hear the tap and wate sound. It took calls on WhatsApp, MS Teams and regular mobile and all had great call quality, both ways.Bluetooth: Really nothing to report as it performs as expected. No fuss! Visible on the phone while pairing with voice prompts and thereafter during powering-on seamlessly.Battery - As claimed, after my day's experiment, I had about 60% battery which is great for the headphones.Music - Good, but not great. If you are particular about sound, you will notice that the bass is boosted and therefore gives a bit of unnatural bass. The highs (treble) are a bit lacking and therefore lacks crispness, which becomes very evident in certain songs.One drawback was the ear cushions on one of the ears keeps coming off. That is exceedingly difficult to put it back.All-In-All a great purchase and value for Rs799. My daughter is very happy with it."
1,"Worst product that I bought from amazon.It was very tight and you could only use it for a minute and the product only last for 2 days .It was very bad experience for me from the Ptron customer service.But amazin saved me,they took the product and gave me revund via cheque ,thanks amazon.Do not buy this product and waste your money.It is the only product that I returned to amazon.So I recommend you not to buy it.If you need a good experience please buy any other products.The sound quality is also average."
1,This is the second time of such malpractice. The seller hides the 13 digit item number on the pack by sticking another tape. This 13 digit number is required to register your product to claim warranty. Amazon ask to contact Ptron and you can never get connected their with anyone. The idea is to avoid people claiming warranty. The first time I bought another ear pods from them same issue happened and I did not register to claim warranty. The pods is not working after a month. Please avoid Ptron at least buying it online.
1,I ordered this item on day before yesterday and got it yesterday but this product is undoubtedly wast. I issued a replacement yesterday for the initial product in which it's charging cable was damaged and the extension adjustment was damaged so i issued a replacement from amazon. But even when i issued the replaced new headphone the bluetooth connectivity was not ok and while in bluetooth one of the sound cap was only working and not the other but while in aux both were working but when i connected to phone it did not work properly. Thanks for Amazon for helping me in returning the product to seller. But the plus point is that its bass which super dooper cool. That's only the plus point. I would prefer not to buy.
5,This is a premium quality product for ptron lifestyle. It's a professional grade 40mm drivers truly deliver you to a music nirvana with a professional fine finish. the amazing battery life and the reduced charge time makes it a marathon runner. The ear cushion provide a comfy experience. The sound quality is fabulous and does not give a pain in the ear. Value for money.Full recommended.
3,"Buttons shown in the pic didn't work, so replaced the headphones, but to utter dismay one button on the new headphones does not work.Sound is okay, don't expect miracles at a cost of Rs 699.Packing was very shabby, a brown cardboard wrapped around the original paper box. No bubble wrap or plastic envelope like you get on other Amazon orders."
5,This Wireless Bluetooth Headphones has High bass which delivers each n every music details crystal clear. It is super comfortable to wear and stay on the head while I am working out in the gym. I am super impressed with this headphone performance and i will recommend for music lovers
3,"ProsLight weightSnug fit, over the ears, comfortableGood bluetooth range, 30 feet.BT connects immediatelyClear audioAffordable, comes with Aux cable which is a plus as compared to other headsets.ConsNo Bass, not for music lovers, songs sound very flatBT disconnects during callsIf you wear spectacles, then the snug fit presses the specs into the head and causes painEars heat up if used for >20 mins, causes discomfortNo noise cancellation, you can hear everything going on around you unless you keep volume very high. I prefer low volume.The ear muff material is light weight but flimsy, dont expect it to last very long.Overall, a decent headset."
4,"Look - GoodBuild quality - OkBattery - ExcellentBass - Can hear bass all over track, but can't feel the punch of base. Not bad bass like BOAT device. Not good as SONY.Sound clarity - Due to all along bass, vocals and instrument sound suppressed a little, like BOAT headset.Sound quality - Good for BOAT lover, Bad for JBL/SONY loverFitting - For 30 min its ok , after that feel little discomfortSound quality become better when connected with aux cable."
1,The aux cable stopped working after one month. The volume decrease button stopped working after 2 months. Please stay away from this product. Seems that an old stock is being pushed now.
1,"üòî Great disappointment! After reading positive reviews, i got impressed and placed an order on 06.10.2020 and received he headset on 09.10.2020 and i paid Rs.899/-The headset is not getting charged and the charger provided is getting alarmingly overheated within a minute.  I am highly disappointed.  However i thought aux cable is there. But what a surprise... when aux cable is connected, only one ear is working.. üòîI want to return"
1,The product is definitely not good quality. It just goes off in the middle while you are using it in the Bluetooth mode. It is very embarrassing when you are attending some online session as it just switches off on its own despite being completely charged. Also when you try to lower the volume it is not quick. Sometimes it just does not lower the sound how much ever you press the minus (-) button.
1,"Not satisfied with quality.1st of all the ear cushion and head support are made of reggine so in 2 minutes you start feel sweaty and in 10 minutes it start irritating. Even in AC.Sound is poor and noice cancellation is okay.Also bluetooth has issue as it reset volume to highest after every call.I am Using patron in ear bluetooth devices 3 pieces, they are good. Not this one, its waste of money."
5,"I used many types of headphones i am not satisfied anyone and I purchased this after seeing its features. I would like to share my experience here, I am fully happy with this pTron headphone.In the box, there is a headphone, charger cable, headphone-mobile plug wire, and manual. As the described the product comes the same. This headphone has high quality bass and sound effects.pTron Studio wireless over-the-ear closed-back headphones are known for their comfort as well as their sound quality. Worth for money."
2,"I bought these solely for afternoon/late night listening as I did not want to disturb the neighbours with my 7.2 home theatre system...saw they were inexpensive and still rated highly by Amazon/users, but I was wrong! (Lesson learnt...Amazon user ratings are unreliable, must check independent reviews)Pairing: paired with mobile quickly, but took several attempts with the smart TV.Sound quality: Below average, maybe just par for the price! PTron earbuds (Bassbuds Pro) have quite an amazing sound quality and a great pairing efficiency for the price, but these (PTron Studio) headphones are nowhere like them. There was a crackling sound initially, after a few seconds the music/dialogue was audible, but the quality and clarity were poor. Bass is almost non-existent. Wanted to return them immediately, but only a 'replacement' option was available (!) hence I have decided to just discard them since I don't want to spoil my audio experience. Ordered Blaupunkt BH-11 instead, let's see how they turn out!"
2,"Edit: Just want to verify, I got a new one today, but the design looks different, and even the sound quality differs, as compared to the previous one. The previous one had a thunderbolt through the o of the ptron logo. I hope this is genuine, right? Btw. The previous version was much better... the highs were perfectly balanced. It was crisp and nice. But the new ones have muddled bass and not so clear treble. Greatly Disappointed."
5,SOUND QUALITY IS. GOOD. BASS=GOOD. TREBLE=GOOD! STEREO EFFECTS WORKING PROPERLY! BATTERIES MUSIC PLAYING TIME IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE=12HOURS+++ WHICH IT MEANS 2 HOURS SINGLE CHARGE DURATION UPTO 6 HOURS/DAY AND ANOTHER 6 HOURS/DAY TOTALLY 12 STILL THE BATTERY SHOWING APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENTAGE! LITTLE PAIN STRATRS AFTER 45 MINUTES! OTHERWISE SO GOOD! IT'S LOOKING LIKE HIGH BRANDED AND WORKING LIKE BRANDED! WORTH BUYING!
5,"Wanted this kinda headphones from so long, finally got it. Sound quality is perfectly awesome . I m damm sure after  u get it , u will feel same. Saxy quality boss üî•"
1,"I have ordered as per Ptron said to avail warranty of my previous ptron product.Ptrons says that we should buy something priced equal or more than for which we want to claim warranty and they will process the refund once we receive the new product.So this way, Ptron is increasing it's sell.Otherwise the quality of headphones in this price range is far better in OTHER BRANDS.Ptron is using CHEAPEST MATERIAL to build product which would not even last till it's warranty and would ask customer to buy new product which means that Sales would go high and also they could show to their investors that How much Customers trust Ptron that they buy products regularly.Also, Ptron customer care doesnt read the Email thread properly and reply based on their presumptions.Ptron Customer Care never works on phone call. They will provide a Number which is never gonna connect your call to the customer care.I have It's been a month since I have submitted warranty claim for my previous product and still they have not even acknowledged that they would be making refund"
5,"These headphones are pretty good for their price and I think that is the brand proposition.Pros:-Light weightHas an 3mm jack for direct useBattery lasts long on moderate useEasily fits all head size as it has adjustable head bandBluetooth coverage area is also pretty decentThe price.. :)Cons:-The earcups become hot after a while- so use moderatelyThe plastic quality though sturdy but its not for rough useThe audio quality could be better but for an average listener its goodAt the end, the price point beats all the cons I bought it as an standby pair and just as an experiment honestly, but I was pleasantly surprised with it.  If you don't want to spend much and if you are starting to explore the wireless headset domain its a good starter headset."
1,"Bad product. From day one the mic wasn‚Äôt working. Also the Bluetooth disconnects from the audio within 10 to 15mins. Third day I have raised a replacement request. I got the confirmation that the replacement has been dispatched. To date not received. Complained to Customercare. First time bad experience with Amazon online orders. Especially, need more careful while placing orders for the electronics. I hope the Customercare would comeback with proper investigation."
5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
1,"On very first time after connect with my phone one Right side speaker are not working.Very bed product,Package are broken from inside.Please don't buy cheap items, buy at least modarate items. After reviewing all comments. Don't impress by Hrithik,Go with product quality."
4,Very nice sound quality nd good bass ..nd bass quality nd sound not harmful to hearing ...Very nice üëçüëç
3,"No return option available, placed for replacement.1. Received the product at 12:30pm,tried to turn on but it seems the battery was drained out so put it on charging using cable and power bank.2. Once plugged in, a small red light glows indicating charging process and in 1 hour that turns to blue to show complete of charge.3. At 3:15pm paired it with my phone and started playing PUBG mobile, Bass seems to be high and conversations are audible but not excellent.4. At 3:40pm I start getting ""Battery Low"" announcement during the game and headset shuts down by 3:45pm.5. Kept it for Charge again which took from 4:00pm to 5:00pm to turn blue again.6. At 6:15pm turned on headset and paired it to Phone and started playing songs on Wynk.7. Bass is good and dominated the song while FM is not good based on poor signal reception quality.8. At 6:45pm the battery low notice starts again and shuts down in 2 minutes.Received the replacement, kept the headphones on charge for 1 hour, played songs continuosly for 1 hour battery still shows 70% available. Audio is better than last one(lesser bass). However when connected with Aux cable only one side of headset is audible seems like problem with Aux cable however I can get used to this, Still not totally satisfaction but good buy at rs700-800 price mark."
3,These are my honest review of the Bluetooth headphone after using it for two weeksLet me divide into two categories likes and dislikesNumber 1 likes:-1. The sound quality is average . Bass is moderate overall average in this price category.2. The play pause volume up down button are working fine.3. Battery back up is decent.4. Bluetooth range is good.Dislikes1.You can't use it's for longer period your ears starts to hurt after an hour of usages.2.Takes long to charge.3. Many times there is disturbence in the music while listening as if the Bluetooth connection is getting disconnected and connected automatically.But at this price point it's an average product .
1,"Too bad quality of these headphones. I never think that Zebronics music product quality is like this. I have a Zebronics bluetooth Home theater speaker, only bcz of that quality of speaker I bought the zebronics bluetooth headphone. But this is the poorest quality, also these are too light weight, and the AUX cable is so light. It is like that at any time it can be damaged.I request to all the people plz plz if you are thinking to buy this item,then plz forget this. If you are interested to waste your money then yess you can buy this.But according to me and my family, this is only and only wasting of money."
4,"Good headphone at this price bass is more,moderate and  comfort. Bought at rs.820.Mic issue when on Bluetooth mode."
4,"I purchased Zebronics Zeb-Thunder Wireless Blue Tooth Headphone in March this year from Amazon and delivered to me just 2-3 days before complete lockdown.What it OffersObviously over the ear headphoneIt's Bluetooth and so not wiredIt has a built-in FM Radio (See Con Points)Provision for SD Card to load SongsHands-free phone conversationOperates by a battery and it can be charged via  USB for which USB connector is supplied with the Gadget. Only connector no charger, please.It has a surprising and unique feature that no other Bluetooth headphone offers. It is having provision to connect to a phone or any other music source by wire and the wire is supplied with the gadget besides the charging USB connector. This helps us to continue to listen to music even when the Headphone battery needs a recharge.PROS:Excellent and superb audio quality and plenty of bass and sound which can be adjusted to your liking.Good Design aesthetically made and quite appealing to the eye.Good battery life even when not in use for days togetherBest price and easy on the pocket. Surprisingly priced very low at Rs. 772 from Amazon and it's being shown at Rs. 840- today when I checked just now (10th July 2020).CONS:FM Radio Khas Nahi hai. Its like, Is it available? Yes, available type.I could not tune it to all 10 stations that are available in Hyderabad. Normally, when we opt for FM radio,  one of the stations can be listened to, and to get another station, we need lots of patience. Instead, we can as well switch on FM radio on our phone and get it via blue tooth in the headphones.The FM Stations' reception is very poor and always with the FM noise in the background.Although the Head Phone looks wonderfully giving a very expensive look, I am afraid it may not withstand rough use. No complaints on this count so far in the last 3 months.I load my favorite instrumentals to enjoy crystal clear superb quality audio during my morning walk. I am charging it once a week. When it is paired with your phone, the percentage of charge shows in the Bluetooth interface of the phone. So accordingly, we can decide when to charge.Overall, I give 4 stars out of 5(Because of FM Radio 5th star not given) and recommend for those who keep their electronic gadgets out of the reach of children and use them gently and of course who love music with good quality audio."
5,"Had always known Zebronics to provide quality speakers at fractions of cost of others, and this headset didn't disappoint either. Fits well, looks neat, and sound quality is great and seems well balanced among low-mid-high spectrum. Pleasure to use!"
5,It's amazing with high bass clear sound quality it's totally ossum
5,Like the product as described by the company. The best part is that they are comfortable. I wear them for atleast 3 hours straight sometimes but the don't hurt. AUX cable option is great when the batteries are drained.
5,"Wow! This product is just really amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è. I loved it's sound . It has a feature of extra bass. The most liked feature by me is that it has aux as well as bluetooth. I loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è. Of someone sees my review . I will recommend you to buy this product. It's amazing üëå. If some gamer is seeing this, so I will recommend you to use this product for gaming. It feels like you are in the game when you play any game wearing it. At the end I will only say that I really really really love this product üòç!"
5,"Very Good Product Budget For A Good Affordable Price And Sound Extreme Level As Mobile and PC Computer Good Bass level and Sound Quality.Not displayed battery level in Mobile,Only shown Bluetooth icon,Ear muffs also very good to wear comfort..Overall i satisfy..."
1,"frequent disconnection in charging. The red light gets on for some time while charging and the gets off. Again i take out the charger and insert it. Again the same thing happens over and over again.Sound quality is good, no complainBut charging difficulty is coming very much."
1,I just ordered this product because of good reviews but trust me it's not at all good when it arrived at my place first time its mic was not working properly so I replaced it and the second time when it was delivered it was broken then again when I try to replace it Amazon give me the option for refund so thanks to Amazon for refund.Advice:- Not to buy this product because of cheap rates go for wired headphones at this price they are more good than this product.
5,"The battery lasts a very long time. After a full day's work, battery is at 70% for me. I guess it could last 3 work days if I didn't recharge it daily very light weight no issues with ear pain  cushion is so soft comfort this many features not available Rupees 6000 branded headphones now a days can‚Äôt say more about this product no issues at all g productIf you're an audiophile, or you care about the sound quality, all these headphones are mediocre. They are tuned to the taste of the average consumer - there's a lot of bass andSo far these work great! I'm still concerned about the durability, but I'll also only be using these guys for walks and runs around the city for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, that mitigates the risk of damage."
1,Pathetic I want to return this product but I am not able to as there is no option of return just I can replace.I really don't like the built up quality.Sound quality is also not good.Battery is also not upto the mark after full charge it works only 1:30 hrs.I need money backInfact the box is also damaged and the package came to me was also not packed properly it was also damagedThe product was full of dust as if it feels like it is used product.I have ordered a fresh product it feels like it is used and full of dust
1,Too bad sound quality.no bass sound. Very worst product performance.
5,Product is very cost worthy but the delivery service is very bad....the delivery boy came to my gate shout like a freak and left the box outside gate without making any call.... its slight rain outside and the box was kept outside and delivery boy just ran away... I know one should follow the social distancing in this pandemic period but there is a civilized ways to deliver electronic products especially when there is rain outside.... I have no words to describe the such pathetic way of delivery service.... product is nice but highly disappointed by the Amazon delivery service...
5,"1) micro SD card option of music is the best option to hear it without laptop.2) Battery backup is awesomely good and i use this headphone almost half day nonstop or more but no need to worry for battery level.3)10-12 feet distance no disturbance,4) AUX wire quality is low but working properly.5) material used is feels like of low quality plastic so no idea how long it will run.6) overall i am happy for this product as more than expected good sound quality i got.7) must buy item."
1,"I got this product today. After much anticipation and offer by Amazon, I opened the box and connected it to my android using blue tooth connectivity. Sound is awesome, connected quickly checked with the device volume option, it worked fine. When I wanted to check the volume option from the headphones, I found that the volume down was broken. I changed to FM mode, it did quickly after pressing the play/pause button for a few seconds...I found that the volume was decreasing automatically.... I found that the volume down button is stuck and is pressing the volume on it's own."
1,Pls Don't buy this Zebratronic Thunder  Bluetooth is not getting connected and if at all after much deficultly Disconnects often.  Searching for a service Center and getting it repaired is very deficult since I live in a small town i have to go to a city some 423Km away.  Pls DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT you are throwing your hard earned money in garbage if you go for it.
3,"Update after buying a second one:The first one had the frustrating habit of  switching to FM mode from Bluetooth if I moved my head at times. And the central selector button didnt work. So each time this happened I needed to power off the phones and switch it on again. I thought this was how this product was and was starting to live with it when I decided to gift a friend with a pair. And to my surprise and dismay I found that on the second unit the selector worked fine. And now that the return window is closed, I feel a bit disappointed so I have knocked off a couple of stars from my rating. Buyers check this selector button or you shake your head the female voice in the headphones says ""FM Mode"" and you are hit with deafening static. Shake your head some more and if you are lucky that same voice says ""Bluetooth Mode""All-rounder like Kapil Dev üòÅBluetooth, superb bass, volume control, provision for direct non Bluetooth connect, can play music independent off any other device from a micro SD card , FM radio,Comfortable to wear and audio is excellent.Only thing lacking is provision of a mic to equalise music and conversation.But, I can live with that deficiency."
5,This product give its üíØ many of saying bad battery life but that is not true ihave use this headphones for last 4hours and its 50% Now  so it is nice produce nice quality evwn its ear cushion are also perfect if u want many fearures under 1000 then it is a perfect its connect with bluetooth very easily its is comfartable one of its disapointing this is light plastic use it can break if u dont care of it thanks
5,It's battery üîã Life is Just exellent it has loud speakers üîä that's why you not need to raise volume over 50% and at this volume it easily last 4 days at 2.5-5 hrs of usage...Connectivity is also good you just press power button for 2 second and it starts then it's blue light blinks till it's not connected ...start bluetooth then once you connect manually fron secound time it will connect in less than 30 second...Bass is not too great but very good and clear sound quality at this price point...And what I feel best is supported memory card and also have very DURABLE BUILD QUALITY..... And of course good battery üîã Life...You can buy if your budget is around 600...I got it for 600 rs in sale
5,"I thought it's going to be a light orange but i received a deep red which make.me very happy cause my fav color is red. Ok about the sound stereo windinf id really good, bass are really good but not the best. And it cancel noise really good  perfect for listening music or story without disturbing from around sound. And about bluetooth connect really well backup last longer than i expexted really happy but i don't know how long will that be im talking about the battery backup and one last thing we still can connect with audio jack 3.5 that really helpful if the battery backup out ang specially good for gamer. Almost forget we can control the volume, play pause, next and previous directly from the headphone which is really helpful. I will update about the battery backup later and dont forget u can charge it using mobile charger i.e micro cable charger. U will get the micro cable with this headphone free."
5,I got this Zebronics Thunder for Rs.599 which I would say is an amazing deal and like any other headphone it does has some pro's & consPro's :‚Ä¢ It's really damn cheap 599/- as compared to other wireless headphones.‚Ä¢ The packaging was great.‚Ä¢ Battery back up us preety good 9hrs/per charge and it takes around 2.5 hrs to get it fully charged.‚Ä¢ The ear cups would you a comfory experience.‚Ä¢ The sound quality is pretty good if you listen to songs from Spotify but it lacks lil bass as per me while playing YouTube videos.Con's :‚Ä¢ The build quality seem to be delicate so need to be little extra careful.  Over all I will rate it 4.2/5.
5,"I know there are many bad reviews on this product but this is fantastick.I love listning songs on this and it works great awsm cooolllll and fantstick.Go for it.Don't wait just buy it now. No need to read more reviews just go for this.Go.........It's mic quality is just awsm and stunning.I love its bass.Thank you seller, zebronis and amazon to give me such a great product.It's battery life is just awsm..........."
5,This product is great for this price go using this for 4-5 months now and just works amazing. Bluetooth connectivity is so strong that i can leave my mobile device connected with this headphones at a corner of room and walk around whole house waring these without any issues ( connectivity can easily penetrate 2-3 walls). Don't over charge it 2.5 hours is max. It works perfectly fine otherwise. Most beautiful part it is that it's over ear and soft and comfortable.
5,Used it for 3 weeks and now I am writting this review. Sound quality and bass is good at this price range. Battery life is enough for a day. Wired connection can also be used if the battery is drained. The sd card slot works well. Volume controlls are nice. Noise cancellation is satisfactory.
5,"Wow!. Its amazing guys üòçüòçüòç. Build quality is decent, but the sound quality is Awesome. Deep bass and crystal clear sound. You can hear the each of the instrumental sound in songs. If you are a normal user. Then it is the best choice. But if you are looking for a headphone for gaming, then its not recommended. Because there is some delay in game, while it's connected with blutooth. But if you compromise wireless mode and play games by connecting the 3.5 mm cable, given inside the box. Then you can go for it. Battery backup is also very good üòç"
5,"Pros:Excellent built-in quality.Bass quality is superb.SD card support.Over 8 1/2 hours of battery back.Useful while jogging, walking etc.Comfortable for hearing.Cons:Time delation.Not that good for gaming.  Totally, go for it."
5,"Excellent product for personal use.Lightweight, good battery life, ergonomic, loud, clear, robust, looks trendy.What else do we need ? And all this for a mere ‚Çπ 649 !!!I ordered it for the kids so that I don't mind if they break it, but it eventually ended in my work table due to its wonderful quality. Ordering one more for kids."
1,"Poor packing, when i was received its in very bad condition.Button functioning is not good. Provided aux cable is too bad its not connected well. Once you connect cable only one speaker is running.Now about charging cable its very poor...!!!I strongly suggesting you please go through other headphones...!!!!"
1,"Guys,  guys do not buy this product its a scam this product things to start malfunctioning after a few days the voice clarity is not good you will not appreciate this headphone if you are a bass lover and problem is that the sounds are not clear and one of problems and I phase personally during the usage of these headphone was that it tends to fall of the Year it's not comfortable to wear and Tear quality is very bad this things to stop working you have to be really really really care for you don't wanna Domestic Product it's really easy to damage it and it's not a good product its not by any means a very solid build product and it's definitely not durable"
4,"Material quality is good but I can't say anything about it's durability. I feel that if you handle it carefully then it's good but if you just roughly use it then may be you broke the headphone from speaker folding side. Sound quality is good at this prizepoint don't expect to much. Although, I receive some day defective product as because right side of speaker is noisy. Some unnecessary noise comes from right side of speaker. I requested to Amazon for replacement hopefully it'll replaced by good product nor defective one."
5,Best Sony headphone for the what you spend. Good sound and build quality. I have been using this for 1 and half year. Only thing happened is material covering the earcups started to peal off. But usable. No issue with the sound or any damaged parts even after rough use.
4,"Okay.... Let me get this straight.... I havent been using this headset for straight up 4 years... I have tried many a headphones and in-ears after this... But for the first 2 years i had no other choice but to use it..... I still use it every now and again these days.... And that should make my review CLEAR as i will give you all of the the wholistic view of the headphones...(MIDRANGE ONLY-audiophiles dont laugh) (ONLY HEAVY READERS MAY READ THIS WHOLE... BUT I WILL TRY TO MAKE IT AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE)For me i have tried BOAT in-ears which come around 599 or 499, JBL heasets which come around 799....and currently Jabra smart halo which was given to me.... Price is around 5000-7000.... Bluetooth headsetNow starting the review.... You must have read the above review and gotten a general idea of the sound quality and its lightweightedness...OKAY these are REALLY LIGHT and COMFY headsets... It doesnt clamp onto your ears like other on-ear headsets...PORTABILITY is on par.... The build is such that it could be folded and there are no useless curves so you can throw them into your bag and do not worry about it being crushed...The third is the main and its the SOUND QUALITY... damn... I am still shocked till this day... How were they able to pack these sounding drivers in there.... And the fact that it was available to me 4 hears ago... Probably lower than this price... I got it for Rs.499 which is just a total steal..... The sound is kinda FLAT.... And if you are a PROPER LISTENER... this is obviously a PLUS POINT.... It has a SOUND SIGNATURE very pleasing to hear and should not build up TENSION and ADRENALIN in the moments where you just want to.... SLEEP...... or relax.... Also somewhat FLAT signature lets you listen to the song the way it was meant to be BY THE ARTIST...Also the sound is WIDE...It doesnt feel that the sound is only playing inside your head... YEAH it is pretty much the best SOUND STAGE you can get at this priceNow before you get too excited... Let me throw to you some of its defects in sound like a saucy villian MUAHAHAHA.... FIRST is that of its loose fit....yea it fits nicely but after 8 to 10 months these becomes kinda loose... So the volume decreases... Doesnt effect the SOUND QUALITY though....Second is bad... But not for all...it is that it has a LOW VOLUME.... If you want to listen to high volume music.... This headphones doesnt go that far... You may be able to increase it through some apps...but it is not that high from default....Third is the NOISE-CANCELLATION.... These have almost no noise cancellation... So if you are in a loud environment... You may hear the music but only with the rumbles of the real world....(For me it is not a disadvantage as i hate noise cancellation but for many it is so I added)The FOURTH is the REAL DEPTH in sound.... Although the sound is organic... But the depth in the sound is really low.... In ears have a greater depth compared to headphones...IN CONCLUSION.... If your budget is under 700...definately get this one for comfort and relaxation... If you are a ADRENALIN JUNKIE... get an in-ear...those go up monstrous in volumes and bass...Also i think i dont need to write about DURABILTY....its been freaking 4 years and i havent had a single issue of time with this thing....Thats all for now folks...THNX FOR READING....and damn you are a heavy reader.... I owe you one"
5,This may not match the more expensive audiophile grade headphones in terms of sound quality but for the price paid it compares very favorably. The bass is good but not overpowering like in so many headphones of this class. The sound is well balanced though it suffers a wee bit on the extreme highs. Overall a good pair of headphones for daily use with laptops and mobile phones.
5,The material quality is Good enoughSound is the main parr of this headsetDurability is far better then otherGreat go for itI get it at only 499 rsDuring festive offer
3,Writing this review after using this heaphone for almost one and half year.Sound quality is not that good. It is low as compare to other brands.Bulit quality is also not very well.As this is cheapest headphone available in market dont expect too much from it.Plus the warranty is for only one year.It means after one year if headphone havunv any damage will not get repair as it is nin repairable prouct only replacement is avaible in warranty.I will suggest this if you want to buy headphone under 600-700‚Çπ range go for it or else go for jbl.
2,"They are decent but are very fragile . Also the fact that it has cable on both sides kind of very much annoys. Also in this range only there are many other good options which have less reviews and popularity. I also say and read all those good reviews and was mistaken with buying them. Also even now after 2 months of use the aux cable always muffules up all the sounds. Also the fact that they do not offer mic is very annoying too. They are really bad for calls and pubg gameplays . Also they have low sound levels as compared to other headphones and a base which is next to none. Also not comfortable for long time. Noise cancellation is just very very little. Also do forget about warrenty because they will not replace it and they are inrepairable. Also for warrenty you would have to pay heavy shipping charges. So , if it stops working just go get a new one. Overall not worth to buy on the name to tag "" sony """
4,"Writing this review after 8 months .The only precautions needed to me was to remove the sweat around my ears before listening , because it damages the black cover . Good sound,  not to much heavy bass. Perfect for normal music lovers. cushion covers give the feeling of noise cancellation upto 50%."
4,SONY headphones with a tough cable and pin. The ear pads can be folded which makes it compact and convenient to carry. These headphones do not possess a mute control and volume control. Reasonably good sound output.The headphones stopped working  within one year from the date of the invoice. Contacted the Sony India Customer Care after getting the contact number from Amazon Customer Care. Excellent service from Sony India Customer Care. They provided the address and telephone number of the nearest Sony Authorized Service Centre.  Produced  the defective headphones at the Sony Service Centre together with a copy of the Amazon Invoice. The headphones were replaced  FREE under warranty with a brand new headphone. Please note: Warranty is valid for ONE YEAR FROM DATE OF INVOICE.Thank you Sony for the exemplary customer service.
5,"Very good sound quality. Actually better than a few higher priced headphones. The sounds are clear and well differentiated, clear vocals."
1,"The headphones dont live upto the Sony name. The Bass is so low that you cannot enjoy a good EDM. The sound is so low that you cannot hear anything in a crowd. The headphones feel plasticy and dont even feel durable. I thought that Sony would be a good brand to invest money into, but, it would have been better to buy a BoAT or something similar."
5,"This is my first on ear headphone, after first day use I can say that it's the best headphone in this price range . I bought it for ‚Çπ570/- . Sound quality is excellent and bass is really good. I'm a huge music lover, I have listened to Sony and Boat ...but If you want to feel the music, if you want to get the rythm of the song, if you want to get the original quality of the song when it was recorded...then Go for this Sony product. Boat basshead 900 has more bass but the sound is coarse , you can't feel it,voice is not that soothing. But this Sony headphone makes allows to hear every bit of sound very clear at this price range. It would be better1.if black option were there2. band was of metal 3.more cusion were there. One thing more, it has gold coated jack that is also a big plus point for Sony.Sound 5/5Bass 4.5/5Overall quality 4.5/5"
4,"The over all quality of the product is 4 star as compared to its priceVery comfortable ,long lasting using it since 1 year and again odered the same,the bass quality is good but sometimes the speaker dosen,t work so.etimes when i listen music one of the speaker stops working and then i change the song and it starts working it has been happened 2 times when i odered new one,s"
2,"I purchased this headphone on January. First few months, it was all smooth, amazing sound quality. But after 3-4 months, one side stopped working. I managed with one side. But today the other side also stopped working. Duhh!!! It's not been even a year. This is not expected from a brand as SONY. I used to recommend this product to my friends. Now i won't ever buy or recommend SONY products."
1,"I made a big mistake after bought it. Because Amazon's price & explanation about this item is very attractive. And if a person read this, he surely purchase it and ordered it. Then waiting for arrival of product by feeling of smartness.After purchased it I fully disappointed and astonished. It feel like a salesman (who sell his items in train or bus stop). Please don't purchase it. It's sound quality is like only an local earphone.And this is non-returnable."
4,"Not for listening to music. I bought it to watch documentaries. It has a high treble and low bass. Great for voice and not thump thump of music. Box say 1350/-. Got it for 645/-. Looks genuine Sony with a warranty card as well. Been using it for a month now, and no problems.  Fits comfortably on the ears. Keeps out environment noise (not completely, just enough). I bought it to watch study videos. Worked for me."
3,Okay product. Sound quality is not great so I would've preferred some other product. But it's okay @‚Çπ500.
3,"This is sony's only entry-level low budget overhead phone.Look wise it may give you appeal that it CAN produce the best sound for the buck, but sadly, it's not!The 30mm drivers sony claims is not producing sound as one would expect by its looks.here's what the sound quality is; (Scale : Good, Moderate and Weak)1. High Range - Good.2. Mid Range -  Good.3. Low Range - Weak.Even though, in specs the freq response is 12-20000 Hz, the low range is very weak. So, the bass feels very flat.4. Surround (Phase distinction) - Moderate.So, you  cannot feel much depth in audio. The music appears playing closer to your ear drum rather actually reproducing studio quality. Also, left/right channels feels having crossover.5. Definition - Good.Thus, you can decode the tracks/instruments in the songs, this is because of the good mid & high frequency response.6. Sound Isolation - Moderate.Ideal to listen in calm and mildly noisy environments like parks, restaurants, work & home. Cant completely isolate cab/bus noises.7. sound production & detailing- Apparently, i feel there is also mix in freq ranges between high, mid and low. OOps! that's not good. Not from you sony!IF YOU CAN SHELL OUT EXTRA BUCKS, THEN LOOK FOR OTHER SONY OVERHEAD MODELS OR SEEK FOR OTHER BRANDS IN THIS PRICE RANGE.AUDIOPHILES STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE."
5,"Very good product & quality is also outstanding of the headphone materialin this price range.product is very good.Light weight,sound is awesome.You can use it very long time because of light weight.Cousin is not hard it is very soft like cotton.I like this product very much.my ear feels soft touch."

1,"on every 11 months the left side ear piece goes off no sound , once exchange befor a year of purchase again on the completion of eleven months the same problem repeats with the new one replaced on warranty. so bad product"
1,"I ordered the product on 5th Sep. Delivered on 16th Sep. Now by 20th Oct the product stop working. Just one month the product was live. It looks like not the original product they gave me.When we received the product it was not in a company blister package, was just wrapped in a bubble sheet inside the amazon carton. My son unpacked it and he did not mention it at that time. Otherwise then n then I should have returned the item. It was a defective item or something else they had delivered. Appario Retail is a renowned retail in Amazon Store. Not expected such service from them.Now the headphone stopped working. This headphone I ordered for my son's online school use. Now he is not able to use this. If Appario Customer service is reading this, please contact me, and please replace the item."
5,"I bought them in Jan 2018 and after a usage of more than three years, these headphones are still reliable, clear sound for office calls, lovely for music. I had brought them in republic day sale without a reason but they proved a very nice deal for me. They are lightweight, cushion is soft to keep the ears at ease and look are premium. Those complaining over lot of things must understand the price segment. Sony sells pretty expensive headphones also and they will definitely give premium quality when it comes to noise cancellation, super bass, out of world feel etc. but you got to pay for it. Expecting the Audi features in Alto is injustice to both.To summarize, these headphones are very good for a decent music listener as it has good amount of bass and sound quality is very good. When it comes to call quality, you can listen clearly and it manages the background noise significantly. Yes, it has a mic and you can use it on your laptop or phone (with 3.5mm jack) for clear calls."
5,"It's undoubtedly the most comfortable ON ear headphones under 1500 rs (Not talking about over ear ones which are bulky)I have used ton of other on ear headphone like boat bassheads 900, it's other wireless models but they didn't offer this much comfortSound quality is goodBass and trebles are pleasing ( Not Heavy bass)3.5mm jack is L shaped gold platedAnd about durability some of my friends had this lasted over 4+ yearsOnly Con I found was build quality but that's acceptable because of less price and it being light weightOverall PERFECT"
1,"Actually I was looking for my daughter. I found it to be a good one. However, the left ear sound was different than the right one. Tried playing different music from different units. The output was not that satisfactory. Similar type of headphone brought 6 months before of JBL with same budget. Compared both JBL is good with the same budget.  However, after return similar product was delivered on the next day. Thanks."
4,"I've been using these headphones for a year now and is in excellent condition. Well, it was, until two days ago when my cat decided to be curious about it.the best feature  - comfort. I've not been able to find another brand of headphones that are so comfortable to wear for long stretches of time.like:- comfort- sturdy (it's seen some rough days with my travelling and generally careless handling.- not very expensive- decent amount of noise cancellationdislike:- sound quality - the quality is decent, but considering that sound quality is one of the primary purposes of headphones, one'd have expected it to be better. But it's still on par the with Boat and JBL products in this price range. If you are the type that relishes music, I'd suggest you look elsewhere- mic: by far the biggest disadvantage.  i listen to music on my phone, so I'd really have liked to have a mic so that i don't have to change headphones everytime i get a call."
1,"The product is very good but I have been using it for two months and after 2 months it has broken itself, its body cheap is of quality."
3,The headphones worked fine for a short while but then there was a problem with the jack. The same thing happened to the headphones of another friend of mine who had a similar pair.
1,"Of about fifty products that I have so far bought from Amazon over the last three years, this is the only item that I did not use for more than 2 weeks. This headphone is fake and did not work. I had to trash it. I lost my money."
4,Headphones quality is awesome so does the build. Wire build is also good. I would rate 3 out of 5 for noise cancellation and 2.5 out of 5 for max volume. Another thing is you have to be careful while opening and folding it. The part which does the job is delegate and has to be handle with care. I was expecting a good volume with bass. Bass depends on the music device.
2,"Beautiful product. Foldable, which makes it easier for storage and carrying, compatible with all devices with an audio jack... Good dustproof material and awesome quality with plastic. The wire is a problem due to tangling with other cables. It is fine with itself and has minimal tangling. Affordable and has a decent sound quality which is amazing for the price you pay for the product. For a budget below Rupees 1000 this is a smart choice. Product is durable, but with using the plastic arc will bend wider to give a better fit, now is this a defect or a special mechanism is a tough decision because mine has bent wider which is causes the headphones to slip-off my head which is giving me a tough time. The product is really nice but not for use if you‚Äôre aiming to use it more than a year."
1,this is the most pathetic product. the headphone has stopped working giving malfunctioning issues from the second week. now they are giving reasons like my mobile is not compatible. Sony customer service India has raised their hands and putting my phone on hold or they mute themselves. search a cheap service from Sony India. rating 1 is it considered to be minus million number. cheap product and cheap service by sony.
2,"Using it for more than a year now. This earphone is working fine but still I had to order a new earphone today (another company) as I got tired of extremely low level of volume output.. Sound quality and performance is great, but even if you keep volume to maximum (both for device and streaming platform), the output is terrible.. I use it for prime, hotstar, laptop movies etc. and faces the same issue most of the time..  and yes I dont have any hearing problem, I am using another earphone too which has way better output..  If you want to use it for watching movies or for songs, please buy something else, otherwise it will just spoil your music experience.."
3,I have purchased this boat earphone few months ago...üòäHere I'm sharing our experience with this product.Build quality‚èÆÔ∏è‚è≠Ô∏è Its build quality is Awesome and looks premium in hands when you hold it in your hands.

5,"Love the sound quality, but moreover the services offered by this company are pretty amazing!I ordered these earphones about 9 months ago and one of the ear buds stopped working about two weeks ago, I read about their manufacturer's warranty, and registered my product on their site and filed a complaint. They, then, picked up the earphones from my address, and sent a brand new one to the same address in two weeks and free of cost."
3,"I bought this in sept and I'm NOT SATISFIED with the purchase... Don't get me wrong, the sound quality is amazing for a earphone this cheap, but its flat... The bass kicks in only when there's too much bass in the music, else the sound feels very flat... Also the audio via the microphone is bad, and the mic is located on the split end of the cable, which is very low... At times I've heard people complaining that they cannot hear my voice clearly... Only for those who are struck with the price tag of 300-400rs... In that range its good, but if you can spend a 100rs more, get the basshead 225..."
4,"For a price of rs 400 it's worth the cost, i previously used boat bassheads 225, now i tried this for pricing it does the job.Pros,Easy fitNice qualityGood bassInbuilt micCons.It doesn't have a clip or dual coloured ear buds noraml black only.Maybe you should give blue, red colour like other products.The connecting cable will be flat unlike folded one, that quite difficult while playing games or youtube bt you figure it out gow to mangae itUpdateAfter 9 months one side stopped working and i have complained in their official website with downloaded invoice from amazon and the next day my product was picked and in next 15 days got newer one. For the 400 rs it lasted about one and half years that was good for the price and it has one year warranty compared to mi and realme 6 months warranty and you have to carry your products to their outlets.Note .While claiming warranty you have to upload invoice that has to be downloaded only in pc version as of now ,so login amzon account in seperate browser in desktop mode or use pc to download the invoice."
4,"This is a very great earphone with a good quality sound, but it's not for rough usage! The sound is flat, so less bass in regular condition! But the earphone has got a very good frequency range. So still a deep bass is possible but with an equalizer. You can try my preset.  Also remember that the quality of sound also depends on your device's sound card."
1,"After using it for less than one week one of the headphone wire comes from the Mic join point. It detached automatically. Yes, automatically. No pressure no pulling caused this. I did my registration and complain to their website. They sent me a ticket number through email and text message. I am so so disappointed ; don't know when pick up will happen and when I will get a non defective earphone. Such a horrible experience."
5,I bought this earphone cause I had read in the reviews that they provide excellent after sales service and replace the earphone if any defect occurs. I had previously tried many companies earphones but in a few months always they would give problems. The sound quality and durability is amazing for the price. But due to rough usage one ear stopped working after 3 months. But the after sales services are amazing. They arranged a pickup of my old earphones and delivered a new pair to me after 10 days.Really happy customer
1,One of my friend has this product that's y I came for this product.  My idea is to by skull candy only but cos of my frd i came for this product. He s having good product but what I got is defective material. Actually i got this by last week at my work place. I got an emergency to travel so i left the product at my office itself. Yesterday I came and checked the product. It's a broken one. Yes it's broke at the connector area.  They hide it and deliver to me. While checking the product didn't work after full checking headset came into 2 parts. Kindly return my money back or send me a genuine product.
4,Got it for 400.  Okay for the price.
1,Sadly just 2 months and it is dead. the most sad part is it was sold with one year warrenty but within a month they refused to replace the item. total waste of  hard earn money.
4,Edit : After two week of usage I realized that sound leaks from the earphone. So other people may get irritated.  Bought these earphones in a sale for 400‚Çπ. I have already used boat bassheads 225 and this time also boat doesn‚Äôt disappoint me. Here are my impressions:ÔÉò Clear outputÔÉò Quality buildÔÉò Low weight plastic build (I was disappointed with bassheads 225 since they have bulky metal build )ÔÉò Great customer serviceÔÉò Medium bassÔÉò Decent microphone ( I didn‚Äôt face any problem during a call)ÔÉò Great designFor 500‚Çπ I think it is overpriced. During Amazon sale and sometimes daily deals price drops to 400. You should definitely buy at this price. But MI basic earphones also comes at this price. If you are looking for clear sound quality you should go for mi basic otherwise for bass you should go for boat.
1,"its been two or 3 weeks since i brought this item, it was working well for 3 weeks after i brought this item and then all of a sudden one of the drivers stopped working and i was like damn these earphones were made by a leading company how come they could have made such a unworthy product. and the main part is that the bass is not that good actually saying bad. so, i suggest everyone not to buy this product.  SPREAD THIS !"
1,Volume button is broken in barely a month ! cheap product ... Not worth the buck
4,"I haven't heard about this brand until my colleague told me about it when I was looking for earphones on Amazon. I ordered this pair after reading 80% good reviews on Amazon. It arrived within 48 hours thanks to Amazon Prime. The pair looks beautiful. The sound quality is surprisingly good for a below 500 rupees earphones. The only problem with the earphones is the fit, it doesn't stick to your ears when you are walking or running. I have to keep adjusting it every 5 minutes. Other than that, it is more value for money."
5,Just loved it and sound quality is awesome üòçüòç Mumbai Indian edition is the cherry to the cakeüòç
3,I have lotsn lood Earphones. I have bass heads 225 as well. To be honest this one is for a more casual use in bikes and travel etc and there's the problem.the wires are actually not looking that strong and the lack of L pattern jack actually makes it a problem for keeping pockets jeans and riding a bike.Sound burn in is extremely important and no one reviews that way because everyone will just buy and plugin and give the reviews the drivers need to be calibrated for any speaker earphone headphone anything for a minimum of 20hrs. I have kept it on olaymode for more than 8 hrs now and this is really good. Bass is real good and serves the purpose very very well.Major points1.its not as sturdy as bass heads 225 is atleast in the feel.2.the look n feel is not premium again compared to 2253.why they didnt give an L pattern jack they only know and it sucks4.price point is great just below 400.5.most importantly the brand presence and service is great.Buy it if u r a basshead and also the vocals are great. I always listen to Arijit Singh Laal ishq from Ramleela for testing any earphone and headphone its superb... Butbuf u have a little more budget go for 225One small note for the bikers... This will be a great in helmet choice as bass heads 225 will be a little pain on the ears within helmet as it has a little longer metal ear cap vent.
5,"Looking for earphones online? This may be the best choice for you.if you are a stock Android user or any user, this earphone provides the best hearing experience.I'm using this earphone since hours, but no pain in ears or head,  that means their ergonomic design really worked.The Black colour looks more classy then other colours , and its design is beautiful .if we talk about comfort.., do they well played here.,these are so comfortable .but we can purchase same audio quality earphone through the market , like ubon big daddy bass for less than 300 rs but the durabilty ,and comfort is not same as these earphones .Cable - cable is good ,it is tangle free and easy to handle.Design - impressive design , it doesn't fall from your ears even while running .Button - it provides a single button , but can fo many things with this single button if you are a android user .1. double tap to play next song .2. triple tap to play previous song .3. long press to access google assistant and directly apply operations4. single tap for play and resumeThe button is comparatively very smooth to press."
1,"Says on the pack extra bass. But no bass sound. So I installed a Equalizer in my phone and increased bass. Right earphone started giving additional ish ish sound at the end of each bass beat. The kind of sound you would hear if you increase the volume too high and the speaker diaphragm makes a sound out of extra vibration. I have used senheiser before. My toddler son  has habit of breaking things, so settled for this one. If you planned spend more. Just go for other ones. Not this product."
4,Good sound  reasonable price
1,"Por sound clarity, we can't expected this type of poor quality from Boat"
4,"Boat brand was unknown to me. I gave it a shot and bought these earphones after reading several positive reviews. For this price there are no other better earphones out there. First thing I noticed was how strong the connecting cables were, much tougher and sturdier as compared to other well known brands. The earpieces also fit tightly into the ears and seem on the harder side. They will never fall off from the ears. Sound quality is above average as compared to their next product in the hierarchy. Frankly the only missing part is the heavy bass.(this comparison is unfair as I also use Sony XB 550) Other than that an excellent product."
5,"Having used SoundMagic ES18s, JBL C200SI and Sennheiser CX 180 Street II which are known top selling. This product is breaks the budget market segment. Here is my verdict:Pros: 1. Great for Bass lovers. 2. Overall clarity of output is quite good. 3. Eye catchy design. 4. Mic performance is good on calls. 5. Decent wire length.Cons: 1. The wire is of high quality but feels too rubbery.One of the best in ear earphones if you are looking for daily use and do not want to spend much on an earphone.Overall the sound quality is too good for its price. I would recommend this product especially for phone usage."
3,"Okay product. Will comment in 3-6 months regarding durability.These are supposed to be basshead earphones but I don't think they qualify - not at their price range.They don't really boost bass just amplify it and make the entire lower range frequency louder. As a result, if you go above the halfway volume mark, the sound sort of starts cracking and hurting ears. The problem goes away a bit when you tweak the sound settings. However, the range is small. If you optimize settings for bass, then treble starts cracking, and if you optimise for middle range sounds (can't really get a good treble), then bass starts cracking. Just not satisfactory for me.Of course, everyone's taste in music is different and their requirements from earphones are different. Obviously, I listen to everything from Opera and Death metal to bluegrass and hip-hop to rap and jazz to Punjabi upbeat songs and Ghazals. So this earphone covers only a fraction of all that and hence I do not particularly like them even for the price of rs 379 that I paid in the lightning deal. There were a few cheaper earphones that were much better than these and I only bought this because they were out of stock.However, if your taste in music covers a narrow frequency range and similar genres and you just want loud percussion sounds and don't care about much else, go for it.As for watching TV shows and Movies, earphones generally don't affect the experience that much unless they are too good or too bad. However, here too, I find that the sound gets annoying if the volume is too high and I cannot eat while watching because it amplifies the sound of my jaw too much. Plus it makes everything sound a little weird. But I guess the last part gets adjusted with use.All in all, I will try a different pair next time. I mainly checked the reviews and bought them because they were rated high on durability. If they break soon, then there will be no point in me ever buying them again. I will see how long they last."
1,"Felt like Cheap Chinese Headphones in some nice packing.Go for Sennheiser, I wasn't able to wear then single day.Pro - So Loud at full they can even bleed your ears too.Cons- High bass driven outshines the highs and the mids ( Vocals lie deep down that boom boom)- Not that comfortable to wear.- even design is So called hawk but it is not if comfort is considered.Choice is Yours."
1,Worst product ever. No bass no sound quality at all. If i get less than 1 star option i will give that.
1,"honestly saying, i was influenced to buy this product from my friend who is already using this product. i opted this over sony as this product is giving better sounds than that. i purchased this product and after few days of using, the left earphone started to give odd sounds. it actually giving symptoms of not going to work in future, exactly what happened within  days. it completely stopped working.i thought a product defect and applied for warranty (used for one month). then i came to know that the same problem my friend is also facing with the same earphones. his earphones also got the same wire issue.so i better suggest you to not buy this product.thank you."
5,Quality is very good & Need to improve printed logo Of Mumbai Indians or you have to write Mumbai Indians it's faint.
4,‚Ä¢  fast delivery and in good condition‚Ä¢  build quality or earphone is good and bass is excellent with this range‚Ä¢ sound quality is good there is no pain in my ear even after continuously use or 1.30 hour
5,I got this product for 399 rs and its worthy.Tho it's not as comfort as other earphones in our ears it gives you nice music and base is okay.Its more worth than your money I'd say if you buy it for 399
1,"What I dislike about this earphone is its design. It is not at all ergonomic.There are some significant flaws. I write this, after having used Mi red phones which are in the same price range -300-400/-1. The ear buds are too small and don't give you that tight grip feel. It will fall off in the slightest of activity2. Position of mic: The mic is situated very low, at the point of intersection between 2 strings. It literally falls till you lower chest. So while talking on phone you have to hold the mic up manually near your mouth. In Mi earphones mic is placed near the right ear string, at a height near your face. That makes it easy to talk while earphones are on.3. The connecting cable at the point where you plugin to your phone is too long. That makes it prone to a lot of bending.This may cause early breakage.Having owned both earphones, I would recommend Mi over Boat.Voice quality is similar. Just above decent"
1,I bought it 3 months before was working fine suddenly it mic was not working I couldn't fond the reason I contact boat company even I have all my gadget from. Boat after my headphones u bought another one for my parentbut my one is stopped working reason is nothing the company is not ready for claim or warranty really upset the why I should go all my products with Boat so I stopped purchase it from boat
1,The product was very good for the first 10 days of my purchase but then after my calls getting disconnected automatically when headset is connected and few abnormalities happing when connected. Unfortunately the return date is expired. Don't know what to do.
5,"Just two hours into listening music on this headset, and it is really at par with many of the reputed brands..I have been a fan of JBL head sets but, this one is also is at par with it but at a lesser price.. started to like boAt as a brand and lifestyle products manufacturer. Even the shape of the ear buds is different than regular rounded shapes...Good to see some different shaped head set.Got this one during the sale on Amazon, and I feel it's value for money."
1,Actually there is nothing in the product that can be appreciated..The product is promoted on the basis of quality of extra bass which is totally a fake promotion. There is no bass..and the sound quality is also very disappointed..Overall the quality of the product is very cheap and below average....An earphone of costing Rs 50 has much better quality than this product....Its my humble request to you please stop cheating customers through these fake advertisement and promotions......
1,"Very bad product! I bought in may,2019 and only after 3 months one side of the earphone is not working! And the invoice that i have received from amazon, the boat customer care is telling it to be invalid when i am trying to opt for the warranty. Very bad experience! After this i called amazon and then had to download the invoive from the desktop site of amazon.in and not the amazon app..after that i could lodge a complain and then i got a replacement after 1 and a half month.."
1,"Bass is not good. The sound is just like as chinese low quality product.There is no instant refund policy, first they will provide you replacement which is not useful. If not satisfied then refund for returns will take long time may be 15-20 days. The seller does not care customer."
1,I bought this headphones on basis of Amazon Rating. But quite disappointed with quality of sound.I have used many headphones and I would say this one is worst I have ever bought.More details given below -Prons -Only PriceCons -Sound quality is really worstNot comfortable fit for earsCan't listen that very small background music which can be heard on some other good quality phone'sEar buds are of low quality and not softI would recommend not to buy only on basis of low price. Pay slightly more but buy good quality headphones.Definitely NO Go ! Don't buy !
5,"I had been using this earphones from last 1  week. It' been fine. The deleivery for this product was on time. The product was not fully protected though there was only box and amazon carry bag. I would like to tell you guys its pros and consPros:-Sound quality is great.Bass is well1) Treble is ok, somehow it is diminished by 2) High tones3) Buid quality is ok.4) Design is good.Thats all pros now lets move to cons:-‚Ä¶Less than 2 months of usage one side already stopped working.Sound is OK, but what good a product that has no life. Couldn't find a way to replace as well.No extra strains applied, always kept coiled with velcro strap."
1,"Extremely uncomfortable headphones, unusable for more than half an hour, extreme distortions at high volumes, its got only battery life going for it, but the on ear design make them pretty much useless."
5,Firstly I would like to give thanks to MI for providing one of the best sounds.I bet you won't get better Bass in this price rangeBattery is one of the bestI have been using it since last 3 days but still 70% Battery remaining.Guys go Blindly and Buy this.Bass is at its best. Very soft and One of the best Headphone.
3,Feels like it's made of cheap plastic and don't sound as good as some headphones in the same price range. Also it's not very comfortable as they are small.
4,"Good headphones.I like themThe Mi Super Bass Wireless headphones are primarily built out of plastic while the ear cups are made out of soft foam which will provide for a comfortable fit even when worn for extended periods of time. Besides, the headband is also cushioned with the similar foam as the ear cups. The left ear cup on the audio accessory accommodates three control buttons which can be used to control all the functions like power on/off, play or pause and changing the music track.The Mi Super Bass wireless headphones weigh 150 gram which is evenly balanced across both the ear cups. The wireless headphones have Bluetooth 5.0 which offers a range of up to 10 m. Besides being used wirelessly, they can even be used be in a wired configuration depending on the convenience of the user. As previously mentioned, they can offer a battery backup of up to 20 hours. In terms of battery capacity, the Mi Super Bass wireless headphones are powered by 400 mAh power which can be charged via a micro USB port.The inbuilt battery takes about 2 hours to replenish from 0 to 100 percent charge capacity. They also have a built in microphone which can be used for taking voice calls, playing games and communicating with the voice assistant on users smartphone. All in all, the Mi Super Bass Wireless are a premium looking pair wireless headphones which are highly versatile and are priced aggressively.Thanks for reading the review."
4,"I am very happy by this product. i will write my review by point by point means what i like and don't  like in this price range. i have got it in 1600rs after cashback in amazon prime day sale.PROS1- Battery is awesome. easily you will get 15+ hour battery life2- Bluetooth connectivity is awesome. as it has Bluetooth 5.03- bass is very good. i will give 3.7/54- its very light weight so you can use it for long hour music.5- its cusions are not fixed, its movable means it adjusts automatically on you ears.6- you will not get big branded headphones in this price7- it look very perimium.Cons-1- its material is not good. its looks they have used cheap quality plastic.2- its not foldable.after using more than 3 days i have found this pros and cons. as per my view if you were planning to purchase this headphone in this price range. you should definitely consider this. because this is latest one also you are getting great sound."
1,I am an Mi Mobile user. That's why i jumped to purchase this one. But the headphone has completely disappointed me with respect to its actual job. It has great looks good blue tooth and battery life. but the sound is of cheap quality. tried playing many genres of songs. it fails. also the headphones are very uncomfortable. you cannot wear it for more than 15 to 20 minutes. its just a showpiece with good looks. seems they have started taking indian consumers for granted after the big market share in mobiles. this headphone is just a poor product pushed to indian market. i returned it the very next day to amazon and got refund. stay away from this one.
5,"The bass part is definitely there, but Treble is not that much. Charging time is two hours. The charging port is standard USB 2.0 only do any mobile phone charger will suffice also."
5,Battery>>Mi claims to have battery back up of 20 hours. it has good backup tested for more than 10 hours.It really charge fast. (10/10)Build Quality>>It is made up of plastic . it looks premium .(10/10)Sound quality >>i wanna say they made a best headphone in this price range. Really Impressed with tuning of bass. But sometimes bass  is too much. (9/10)>> Wirelessly it is sometimes lags! <<Wired it is fine! Don't buy if you looking to use them for PUBG game as it is slow and laggy.
4,"Occassion / Sale: Prime Day 2019 (15 - 16 July, 2019)Price: Rs. 1,799Effective price: Rs. 1,519 (10% discount using HDFC card + 20% off upto Rs. 100 coupon on mobile accessories)This is only a brief review, will update the review later after extensive usage and testing.Initial impressions are good, the headphones are light in weight and feel premium too. The design is Xiaomi's signature minimalist design.The headphones failed to make an impact in my case. I tried the headphones on my laptop via bluetooth, Mi A2 and iPhone 5S. Yet none of the devices are Bluetooth 5.0 but I don't think it should affect sound quality.Having said that, the clarity is low, bass feels poor and you can feel distortion at high volume levels. Also, it gets uneasy at higher volumes.Interestingly, you get 3.5 mm aux cable along with the headphones and when I used the headphones as a wired one, it regained my faith upto some extent. The sound quality improved a lot when I used it as a wired headphone through aux cable. The bass feels super punchy but the clarity still feels on the lower side.So, final verdict after testing it for around 30 minutes is that it's not the best one when it comes to wireless headphones but it does feel a good choice if you are willing to use it as a wired headphone.My rating: 3.5 / 5I'll update the review after extensive usage and testing along with pictures later. Until then, my suggestion would be, wait for a while and don't rush into buying this headphone like I did."
1,Sound quality very poor. Returning this
3,The cusion still hurts as it crushes ears.Bass is too much. The treble is lost somewhere and the music doesn't feel directed to ears.Phone/PC equilizer doesn't work while using on Bluetooth.Good for short duration: 30 min to 1 hr use at a strech.
1,"Sound quality is ok for this price but not that great as Mi also doesn‚Äôt claim it provides HD or clearer sound.Battery doesn‚Äôt actually last for even 10 hours from a 2 hours charging.Mostly usage comes around 5-7 hours battery. UPDATE: battery is not charging at all even when using 0.5A 5V charger. WASTE OF MONEY.Comfort is somewhat Ok as Mi claims.Operation with buttons is not that either with iPhone, Amazon music. Only pause/play works, no Fast forward or next/previous songs button assigned"
3,Firstly you need to keep in mind that this is a budget headphone. Do not expect it to do wonders. I am no audiophile so i am content and happy with what Mi is offering at this range. The headphones itself are fully plastic but good quality. The ear muffs are comfortable.  Better than the JBL T460BT When it comes to comfort. 20 hours of playback is something that is not offered by any other brand in this category.  The sound quality and bass are more than what i had hoped for. I previously used the Motorola pulse escape.
1,Feels and sounds like a cheap headphone.sound quality is way too bad. Better go with Mi Bluetooth earphones.
1,"Good Headphones, Sound is decent enough, connectivity also is decent, battery surprisingly lasted longer then expected.Built quality quite poor, Cheap, Cheap Plastic, Comfortable in Fit, easy to operate and easy to connect.Reasons for 2 Star Rating :-Packaging seemed fake,Right ear piece stopped functioning in a days use, Completely stopped.Dont know if its the fault of the company or if its the fake products which get delivered in place of genuine one, Very Common Problem faced on Amazon for quite some time.if it's a fake product then please dont consider my review, but who can say if its fake or not, try to get in touch with Mi customer care to verify regarding the same."
1,"First of all, the heaphones are not at all comfortable.Only the ear caps are soft, the headband tries to squeeze your head which is irritating. Wearing them for long can definitely leave you with pains.The build quality of Headphones is very bad, you can feel the cheap quality once you hold the headphones in hand for first time. I have concerns and doubts on its longevity.Other brands like kotion, boat offer better quality in terms of sound and build. Also they are far more cheaper than this one.Sound quality is the worst of all.If atleast sound was good I would have retained the headphones.Since these are ""on the ear""  headphones, it creates a kind of air lock and thats why there is so much of so called Bass which MI is  proudly advertising. This will definitely create head ache if used for hours together.Vocals are no where clear and treble is completely lost.Even at medium volumes, audio from headphones is audible outside which is very bad.Definitely a no go.I'm returning mine.To all those who are interested, look elsewhere do not buy this one."
5,Bass lovers take this immediately... deep bass and good over all sound quality.Design and looks superb and i used 5 hours continuous battery is still above 70%Value for money.
4,"Off all the ove-ear headphones, this has ranked at the top. Mainly due to it's connectivity.Things I liked1) With Bluetooth 5.0 it does have a good range and has crossed a wall barrier with no or less impact.2) Comes with Aux Cable adding another mode of connectivity3) Bass is pretty good.4) Battery life is good if not used at the highest volume5) Charging time is decent enough after complete drain out. Take a bit more that 2 hours6) Ear cuffs are soft and the band is decently tight. Though it may tend to loosen up a bit after regular use. The plus point is that it doesn't hurt the ear lobes7) Looks good with easy to reach buttons on right speakerThings that can be better1) The aux cable provided is faulty. During calls, I the voice fades out and as fix have the rotate the pin to get connectivity. Seems like the connection is not tight enough.2) Although the bass is decent enough, treble is not comparable3) Has memory of only last Bluetooth connection4) My piece did not have one of the cushion tucked in correctly and had to insert it manually. Not sure if the ear cushions are replaceableContent: Over-ear headphones, micro usb, aux cable and manuals"
1,"The quality is not good. No clarity in sound rather high volume. Within five minutes of listening to it, I got headache. Returned on the same dayof purchase"
1,I made the mistake of buying these seeing Mi.The headphones look and feel cheap. The sound quality is absolutely terrible (The earphones provided with your phone have better quality than this). Bass overpowers everything to the extent that it gives you headache after wearing for 20 min. The design is not suitable for long time wearing.Better spend your money on a pair from boat or any other reputable brand.
1,"I am using this product from last 4 months and when I use Aux cable which came with the product and when switch it to Bluetooth connectivity my Right side speaker is not working and when I tried to call on 18001036286 customer care it saying constantly that all line is been busy.Amazone must have to provide Email or responsible contact detail in the Warranty section, Because when product malfunction then we can easily reach to relevant customer care. I am hustling to reach out customer care my Warranty is about to expire still not received any solution I have tried everything. DO NOT BUY MI HEADPHONES CUSTOMER CARE IS NOT WORTH."
1,Can't use after 30 min ears really hurt; sound quality is average; bass quality is bit over average; Bluetooth sucks; not worth the money; only good thing? Battery backup;returned it after 2 days
1,"First, thank you Amazon for taking the product back and saving my Rs.1799.For me the Audio was good, Build quality is fine but it failed me badly on the comfort.I have a normal size head but the pressure on the ears is too hard and painfulto be able to use for long periods (could not do 20 Mins)."
4,Pros:-Great audio quality for the price-Good amount of quality bass-Connects with both wireless and wired-light weight-looks greatCons:-Build quality is average-Ear hurts after 30 mins of use.-Audio leakage-call quality is averageOverall a good product but require some modifications.
5,"I was looking for a good pair of headphones under 5000 for watching TV late at night when I can't use my home theatre and this one perfectly fits the bill!It's aptly called Super Bass!Even listening to beat boxing is so WoW. Can hear the breathing in between and all.It has very pleasant sound but it's so good at slightly higher volume that I don't want to get used to it and use it for long and get a headache.It's good in terms of comfort but I am definitely buying a bigger pair of serious headphones someday but for this price, in fact, I can easily say there is nothing this, not even close for 4 times the price of this!Melody songs like _Pani Da_ feel very warm and welcoming.Bass is spot on!Volume buttons work like a charm on the fire stick which is very important for me.For movie watching, the way this delivers audio, it's probably everything you can ask for. When you don't want to disturn anyone yet you want the full home theatre effect, this is definitely the one to go for. The sounds of a gun discharging - feeling it in your gut. You get all this. It will surely put you in your own bubble, isolated. Probably not the best for office  since you definitely won't hear anyone call you.Overall, I am super happy with these and I think I might buy a few more for friends and family!"
2,"As opposed to its description here in Amazon:1. the bass is not at all deep,2. the bass distorts at higher levels3. the bass-treble balance is poor.4. voice becomes muffled affecting audio clarity badly.5. Noise cancellation very poor.However, I cannot stop myself from appreciating the:1. Connectivity (Bluetooth 5.0 is awesome : Definitely faster and upto 9.5 metres)2. Battery capacity (Salut!! : 18 hrs playback and 8 hrs standby on 75% volume)3. Build Quality (Not cheap at all but not sturdy either)4. Comfort (Average)5. Form Factor and Style : About the right size but folding mechanism would have been more welcomed. Full marks on Style.I personally opine the main purpose  of a headphone is the sound. And hence sound quality supersedes everything. No product bought from Mi has been a disappointment save this one. Most of the earlier products from Mi were marked manufactured in India under Make In India initiative. But these headphones are marked manufactured in China. That may be the reason or not. Returning this one back to Amazon now."
5,Started using this headset on 6th September and WFH zoom calls. It's excellent. I had no issues with it. The ppl on the other end of the call also can hear very clearly... Bluetooth range is something surprised me... It's really good. Battery life: I am using for calls for 8 to 10 hours on an off daily and on the 4th day the battery is still 30% left.Only discomfort I could say is the ear pains and sweats well I guess it's normal with any over the ear headsets. So will not mark this as product's drawback.In whole I am fully satisfied with the purchase and the product.
3,"Out of 5Build quality: 3Plastic body. You can't fold it which may break easily if keep in backpackSound Quality: 3Bass is ok but not that clear, it just hump but not that punchy.Battery life: 5You don't to worry about the battery life. It last as what it says so.Bluetooth Range: 5You can still roam around with it even if you're charging your phone.Comfort: 4You can wear it for 2 hours but you got to remove it for atleast 5 mins. It's normal even with other brand like Sennheiser too.Price: 4What else can we expect? A battery life with good Bluetooth Range and yes it's comfort to wear too. But you got to compromise with sound quality which you would expect from all headphones."
4,"My ears pain if I continuously use it for like 1-2 hoursüòë.I have been using this headphone for almost a year now and it is still in perfect working condition. It is available in two colors, I got the black and red one. It comes in Mi's branded box with a USB & AUX cable. So the best part is, it can be used wired or wirelessly.Quality(5/5): USB & AUX cable are quite sturdy. Headphone is adjustable and made up good durable plastic which makes it lighter in weight. Ear & Neck cushions are of good quality, nice and soft,Battery(5/5): Indeed is amazing. It takes around 2 hours to get fully charge and last around 15-18 hours easily.Bluetooth connectivity(5/5): It comes with Bluetooth 5.0 and is compatible with all phone brands. I did not face any issue in connectivity till date. It connects to two headphones to stream music from the same phoneSound Quality(4/5): As mentioned the in-built 40mm high performance large neodymium iron boron unit has a bass output that is deep and impactful and Indeed bass is powerful with good sound quality.Noise cancellation(4/5): Is amazing when listening to songs but during calls it throws lot of background noise, though the voice is crisp and clear.Altogether, it is still at the top from most brands at this price range. Go for it!!"
1,"Really Feeling totally disappointed with Mi. Bought Mi Super Bass headphone on the day it was launched. With 25 days, right side is not working. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.Pros: Battery and Bluetooth connectivity.Cons:Whole room can hear what you are listening to.One side stopped working within 20 days of use.Average Sound quality."
1,"Just to make you all aware this is Made in China. It has cheap plastic built in cover. I returned it on 31st May and since then waiting for return pick up but no clue no when it is going to happen, no communication and you can not connect any one in amazon to get any detail. extremely poor customer experience from Amazon. Product is good or bad is something less worry part. Amazon platform poor experience and close communication channels is a bigger worry to me. I know this comment is not getting publish. But Hoping at least it will each to the eyes of Amazon team and they will take some corrective measure to improve the Amazon Platform experience"
2,"Using this for more than 15 days now.Cons:- When connected with my phone(pixel2xl) the wifi singles keeps getting disconnected. There seems to be some sort of clash between the 2.4 GHz frequency used by both- the wifi and headphones. This makes my headphones unusable with phone when i am home. Not sure if there is a solution to it or works fine with other phones.Pros:- The sound for me is decent as i am not big an audiophile and love my bass. I am a heavy user of headphones while working so most of tracks like Dubstep , Trap Music etc sounds good.- Build quality looks decent for this price. MI brandname is something due to which i bought it."
3,I am giving this review after 3 months of use. Bluetooth has been faulty just after 1 month of use. It disconnects suddenly by itself while you are listening to music.Range is not great . Just a big room it can manage in range but not two rooms beyond.my ear lobes hurt with the headset after an hours use ( my zebronics earlier was much more comfortable)Batterylife is not satisfactory. I like listening to edmat full volume. I guess I get 8 ( or max 10) hours Playtimee on full volume.It is decently loud. Sound quality is good.
1,"Mi nailed it once again, I don't think you will get a better product then this at this price point. Battery is just wonderful. Well done Mi team.Revised FeedbackI noticed that volume up key is not working on 12th day, so could not returned to Amazon, then I visited MI service center and they refused to take responsibility, ultimately I dropped in e-waste collection box in same service center."
1,1. Sound quality is below average. It's simply loud. No bass at all.2. I can't wear it continuously for more than 20 minutes.Everything else doesn't matter with the above two issues.What good is 20hours of playback time if I can't wear it for even 30 minutes?This is the second product from Xiaomi that does everything except the expected core functionality. First product being the trimmer they recently launched.It's clearly not worth the money.Also the seal was tampered when I received it.
4,"NOTE:@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,BUILT QUALITY :------------------‚óè boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.‚óè JBL  - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.‚óè Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.‚óè‚óè WINNER- boAt 225 ‚óè‚óèCOMFORT :------------‚óè boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.‚óè JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.‚óè Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.‚óè‚óè WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ‚óè‚óèLOUDNESS :-------------CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI‚óè boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.‚óè JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.‚óè Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.‚óè‚óè  WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ‚óè‚óèSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :---------------------------------------------I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.‚óè boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.‚óè JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.‚óè Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.‚óè‚óè WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ‚óè‚óèSOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :----------------------------------‚óè boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.‚óè JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.‚óè Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :PNOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.‚óè‚óè WINNER - boAt 225 ‚óè‚óèCUSTOMER CARE :--------------------‚óè boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.‚óè JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.‚óè Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.‚óè‚óè WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ‚óè‚óèCONNECTIVITY :------------------All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.VERDICT :----------I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
5,"I have used sony MDR-XB series earphones/headphones for a long time ..I have used XB-30EX, XB-55AP, XB-650BTI just got one issue in all the sony products that they don't last long more than a year.Even my XB650BT which costed me approx ‚Çπ6000 last october(2017), started giving me issues on its right speaker.So my openion on JBL C100SI is that YOU CAN DEFINITELY PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT..!The reason for this is because u can't find any difference in SOUND QUALITY/BASS/SOUND CLEARITY between double/tripple time costing any other product than this JBL earphones.I am using this earphones for more than 4 months and they just sound like my old sony earphones but @ just half the price range.So i suggest you to choose wisely what you need."
1,It worked fine for around 1.5 months and thereafter sound from one of the speaker became almost nil.Two more negatives1) Does not contain volume control2) Identifier to distinguish between left and right speaker is not easy to find and read on day to day basis
1,A reqular buyer on Amazon. But this time completely thugged. The description says Origin India. But have been delivered a Made in China Product. Unfortunately I discarded the box and bag and stuff so unable to return it. But this time is a complete disappointment. A complete different description to what is sold.Even second purchase it's made in china. Posting image.
3,"After using the JBL in-ear headphones for about 10 month the product started showing problem in it's right earpiece.I am trying to connect to the JBL customer care but every time Amazon is providing a number which is not working. The toll free number are always busy of JBL customer service.So if anyone is interested in buying this earphone don't buy it because the after sale services are really bad and probably the worst compare to other earphone products.Lastly, if anyone know how to claim the product please kindly share it with me."
1,This product is not worth the money.My earphone didn't even last 3 months.Now I want to exchange it in warranty but don't know how to do it and I am stuck with a faulty piece.
5,I think it's a one of the most best in quality earphone introduced in marketBecause I have already use earphones like boat headbass100One more and like sony.. senhensierBut after reading some reviews  about this product. I have purchased it from amazon #JBL C100SI is awesome sound effects than other earphone that I have already mention aboveI think it suits almost all mobilesBut some mobiles for best sound and beat we must  adjust equalizer then it produces awesome sound effectsFor both sound and bass .Don't think so..Go for this beast JBL C100SIAnd purchased just for 549 on sale..
4,"Best in dis price Range.Best part of dis earphones dat is tangle-free. Sound quality is owsm,bass is gud, u can hear every single detail.But one thing i want to mention here dat if u r looking for d beat earphones in dis price range wid mic den go for it.And if u don't need a mic den go for Sennheiser CX180 ."
1,"Buying because 'JBL'? Well don't or you would regret it later.1 side stopped working, and going to the service centre 20 km away(okhla) only service centre in Delhi isn't worth it.But waste you money if you really want these üëç"
4,"I have been using this headphone extensively for last 4 months. I have found it durable and easy to use.It's sound quality is better than Boat 225, which was my previous earphones and a competitor of the JBL's one in this price range. Clear sound, good bass and an overall great experience.If you want a quality earphones from a trusted brand, go for this one, you won't regret.PS ~ Amazon was lightning quick with the delivery too."
4,"I am writing this review after about 6 months of use as most earphones i purchased under Rs 1000/- never lasted for even half a year.Surprisingly these are still working well (*touchwood*) despite my rugged use.Pros:- Great external noise cancelation.- Good clarity while watching movies- Reasonably decent bass levels of the price. They wont let you down when the beat drops :P- Being an Audiophile whose working for brands like Yamaha, Jamo Dynaudio, mission amd many more these are the best for music to hear ever subtle note however I have to keep in my that I paid 599 for these on a lightning deal which makes the superb value for money while listening to music.- Gold plated connector pin for higher conductivity.- Clear microphone quality over call or while recording a vlog.- lightweight due to which they are not a burden on your ears and don't fall of your ears easily.- Cable spread adjustable lock built-in.Cons:- Gold plating on connector pin is slightly wearing of after 6 months.- There are better bass heavy earphones at this or lower price point. But this is very subjective to the genre of music you listen too. As to much bass kills the Mids & Highs. So you can call these headphones as balanced.Conclusion:Go for these if you're looking for a pair of branded earphone under 999/- with a microphone which will last you for a reasonable long time & have good quality balanced sound for movies and music.If you found this review useful make sure to hit the HELPFUL button under the review.  Happy shopping  Gills Guide."
1,Within one month left speaker not working. Waste of money.. Don't buy it
5,Superb product!! This is my 2nd time buying these earphones. Before these I purchased Sennheiser cx 180 street 2 but in just 3 months the sound quality dropped to minimum. Had to switch back to JBL.So here's the detailed review...Pros :1. Sound : Too great. Had to put my sound bar to half. Quality doesn't lessens even at the max sound. Bass is superb too.2. Built quality : marvelous built. One thing I like about JBL is that they make slight changes even if the launched model is way old. Built quality has been upgraded. Only thing I wanted was L shaped lead but it's fine.3.  Noise cancellation : great noise cancellation. You can totally rely on this. Once you put on everything will seem great about it.4. Ear comfort : fits too well. You won't need to adjust them once you've put them on.Cons : apart from the normal shaped lead I didn't found any cons about it. It will last for more than an year and can even work for more than 2 years if handled carefully.Hope this will help you decide.Have a nice day!!
3,"I will start with my personal experience, i used almost all the earphone product mostly which is branded and known in market.

4,"I have used a variety of earphones like boat, soundmagic, Panasonic, Sony, Flipkart smartbuy and few more. This earphone from JBL the c100si has clear sound and decent base.Cons1. packaging is very average and the seal sucks because it can be easily tampered and yet go unnoticed.2. Bass loudness is average at best but is very clear though. this is definitely not for bass lovers. Its adequate but its not punchy like boat or Panasonic.3. Treble is a bit high at times and may get irritating4. No angled 3.5mm Jack, might be an issue for some.Pros1. Excellent clarity all over the frequency range2. Decent build quality, looks like it will last for a year3. Mic is good enough for calling purpose.Overall a decent product from a well known brand at an affordable price."
5,Better than boat 225 caz it does not loose easily from ur ear. No meaning of sound if u not comfortable with headphone.I was suffering huge problem with boat 225 when it looses from my ear during normal walking. but it sound is too loudy .C100si is low but has crystal clear sound. Also it fits easily in ear.I am listening songs mostly at night while sleeping but u can not sleep facing your ear to pillow causing some irritation with C100si.And with boat 225 It is anyhow not possible caz it has pole like length of lid and u feel pain.I wanted to buy Sennheiser caz it is more good in respect of comfortablity but due to absence of mic ( which is necessary in PUBG) I forcefully buy C100si.
1,"I bought a pair of JBL earphones on 21/5/2020. It worked perfectly for a few months after which the left side of the earphone stopped working. I launched a complaint @ JBL for the replacement. The customer care gave me an address, which was far away from my house. They said it was the only center in Pune for the replacement of the product.After reaching @ the given address, I was told that the concern facility that they had stopped the service of JBL since past two months & they have even informed JBL about it but JBL didn‚Äôt changed the address @ their portal. After having wasted half of my day and getting such terrible service, in fact no service at all I had no option but to inform JBL about their employee‚Äôs grave misconduct. I requested to speak to their manager but instead of transferring my call they kept it on hold for more than half an hour.It was a hideous experience for me. I do not recommend you to buy their products as the after sales service is appalling and careless to say at the least.The customer service is supposed to be there for the customers benefit and not for making them roam all around the city just to exchange a product which stopped working in a couple of months which was well within the warranty.I have made a decision that, now onwards I will not be buying any product of JBL. Guys, pls be careful while buying anything of JBL."
1,3rd class product from jblüò°. build quality nd sound quality is very poor. Bass is very low..and 1 ear tip is missing...i want to return this but no optionfor it. Guys dont waste your money for this crap.
1,"This is a solid earphone. Although I don't like the sound quality over Sennheiser cx180. But since it has mic and I wanted to play PUBG mobile so I am satisfied with it.Second thing I don't like about it is the design of earbuds. They are always falling out of my ears. I had to replace the ones with a pair from Samsung.Third, the cable is not durable. I must clarify that I use earphones extensively with my smartphone. The cable of this earphone is broken from the joint near headphone jack. Even though it's been barely six months.I am not satisfied with this."
1,JBL has only 7 Service Centers in India....!! Earphone is not working right now so I have to travel from Pune to Mumbai to replacement ??  Check the service center list before buying any JBL product.... Worst customer care experience ever...!! took me more than 30 min. to connect with customer care....!!
1,"I was used it for 5-6 Days.Their are 2 outputs based on my experience.1. When used it Slightly Loose in ear :- i felt Treble/Vocals was so high an no base either you listen music or on call.During calls over night (2hrs) use my family member were easily able to listen what other person speaking on call.after use it make me deaf for shorter time and whole night and next day it cause me headache.2. When used  fit in ear.You feel high base still Treble are here, I felt it that my ear drums was poping.I listened music continue for 30 mintus using YouTube, Goolge Music , Mi music, different Phone but result was same. When i removed it from ear it cause deafness for some time and drowsiness and pain in earOver call still high vocalsSame result for Si200 model but base is lacking and clear audio"
5,"Firstly,I would thank Amazon for their timely and hazzle free delivery.Comming to the earphones, I am using them since last 1-2 months and the overall experience is just what I expect from a JBL earphone worth Rs. 800. Sound quality, material quality and durability is perfectly what I had hoped for. They come with a mic so that is an advantage which makes them a complete package earphone to buy in this price range. I believe most of you know JBL is a brand and hence it goes without saying that it would offer the best in class products. So its a very wise option to buy in this prize range."
4,I Bought this headphone for one of my friend and she is very happy with its AMAZING sound quality.:)It a better choice to gift this product to your music lover friends.Go for it..
5,"Pros:-1.Excellent noise cancellation for this price range. And if the music is on, you won't be able to listen majority of things going on outside. Even in great traffic, it cuts the noise to half of the original intensity without any music. With music,it cuts off the noise upto 97%.2.Sound is perfectly balanced.It was a great experience to listen to all the genres with it.I had absolutely no problem with it. It's been a year now since I am using them and they are still perfect man!üëåüëåüëå3. Mike is located at the perfect spot and has a good power if catching sound. The mike button also works pretty well.4. Have recommended it to all my friends and they loved it too.Con:-This may be only in my case. Because my ears are the smallest ears to be found(according to my family and friends)üòÑüòÑüòÑ and only the smallest size of ear buds fit in my ears. And I didn't get the smallest size of earbuds with this earphone.So, had to arrange it from outside.That's not a big issue as it seems. But lemme tell you, if the earbuds are not fitting perfectly inside, then, audio experience and the noise cancellation property, all goes in vain because your earphones would be falling out of your ear every now and then which is very irritating.2. And being from a middle class household, Honestly it was a bit costly for meüôÑ...but i saved money and purchased it.No regrets for that. It's awesome.But to prevent any damage to it,I covered it up with  cover(spiral wires).Otherwise, no problem at all. It's the perfect earphone in this price rangeüëåTotally happyüòä"
2,"After using this with SONY MDR-EX150AP and CX180.Sound qulity: cx180 lil bit driven by clarity, jbl lil bit driven by base, prefer sony because it has right proportion of base and clarity.Mic: cx180 doesn't have mic others two have.Durability: cx180 don't even last 3 months. One side stopped working, though I had repaired I was not satisfied with the durability. Sony and jbl are still working fine. Will have to see, both seems durable.Comfort: Normal use SONY feels more snuggly and comfortable. JBL comes out often while you are using(I tried changing the bud with lil bigger one but it feels uncomfortable, I'm using with spare bud that's included with my sony headphone and now feels ok). CX 180 fits and feels well but not upto the mark of SONY but while sleeping CX180 is more comfortable because of its less protruding design.***JBL- Other nearby people can easily hear what you are listening (slightly better when used with sony buds)Price: JBL wins.So you decide.Update:JBL stopped working both sides after 10months."
1,"I have been using this for about a week now, and it is already not working at times.  A heavy object was placed over the product, I agree, but I am sure any product has to be sturdy enough to withstand some pressure.  I have to throw this away in another month or so because the quality of the wire is so thin that even a minor mishandling of the wire will mean you are losing the entire money spent on the product.After purchasing cheap earphones for many many years, I decided to buy a branded product. I feel this is not worth it, buy an inexpensive product, comes under your computer, throw it away and buy the next one if you want to buy a product and treat it like a reincarnation of god because it is so feeble in quality is not my cup of tea."
1,The headphone I received was not a genuine JBL product. The sound quality appeared like fake JBL headphone sold by street-vendors. I have an old JBL headphone of same model and there was stark difference in overall audio quality. Never expected this kind of product quality from amazon seller. I have requested a replacement and hope that I get a genuine JBL product.
5,"Perfect birthday gift to music lover.Sound quality are awesome. It s very comfortable and work perfect for listening for long hour.

5,"I am actually this product (earphones) continuously for 20 hours a day (be it listening to music, or talking) and I am fully satisfied the quality of sound it is providing. Actually the best one can have in this price range. Even in crowded place or wherever I go, it provides me full satisfactory audio quality, and smooth experience. It fits into the ear so finely (and light weight) that I didn't have to bother about it or put it off while I am in bike or cycle. So, basically, it is worthy my money and I am writing this as a satisfied customer of this product. Thank you Amazon."
5,"Firstly, I have been using this earphones for about two months, and I haven't seen one single problem. The length is a little too long, but it's okay. Noise cancellation is just mind blowing. Even if you just put them on and not play anything also, you can't hear people talking around you. But if it's at full volume, even if battles are going on around you, you can't hear them(a little exaggeration, haha) If you are an extreme basshead, please go for boAt. The bass in this earphones is basically non existent, but hey, you don't buy JBL for the bass, but for the pure sound(which is wonderful, by the way) Even if you are a person who likes the Apple model of earphones, and not the shove in the ear type(like me), you won't find any problem with the comfort, thanks to the angled design. Finally, definitely buy this product, but wait until the price becomes 549 Indian rupees(about 7.45 US Dollars, 6.09 Euros) , because Amazon sometimes makes it 700 Indian Rupees(9.5 US Dollars, 7.78 Euros). Whatever type of person you are, you will find these earphones an absolute delight. I loved them, and I have given them a 5 star rating on everything except the bass. I recommend the white version(ONLY CAUSE IT LOOKS BETTER). Hope this review helps a lot of people. If it helped anyone, please say so. I will feel happy."
5,Headphone review1. Packaging good2. Made of premium quality plastic3. Very comfortable no pain in ears after using it for 2 hours4. Noise reduction is very good5. Bass is little less but trebble is quite good and very balanced voice.6. Very good branding.7. Mic availableBad thing is wires are not tangled free and JBL should provide a pouch to carry.Otherwise better than Skullcandy and Mi basic earphone. If you don't need mic go to Sennheiser.Overall satisfied with the product...!!
5,"Today I would like to compare it with Realme Bud 2.In terms of build quality Realme slightly better. Realme is 1inch longer than JBL c100si. But Realme gives 6 months warranty and JBL gives 1 year warranty. Both has mic. But JBL has one control button and Realme has three buttons, one control button and other two to increase or decrease volume. JBL hasn't any rubber band/strap to organise it's cable. Realme cable are braided nylon cord whereas JBL use normal rubber material cable. Though both are tangle free, but Realme is better in terms of cable quality and to manage it's cable than JBL.Now comparing sound quality, I found JBL far better than Realme. Many YouTube blogger said that Realme sound is best in ‚Çπ600 -700 price range earphone segment because of it's 11mm driver. They gave better position to Realme than JBL. Though Realme has 11mm driver, but it's sound is noisy. JBL sound quality is smoother than Realme. Bass and treble everything is clear and the sound doesn't disturb your ear. I can say it sounds like Sony music system. You will surely love to listen music with JBL c100si earphone.In terms of fitting, both are good. But JBL has little bit edge over Realme because of it's shape. And Realme is slightly heavier than JBL.Regarding call quality, I didn't find any difference in call quality in either of these earphones. The sound is clear in both ends.Hope this review will give you a clear idea to choose the right one...üëç"
1,"Noise cancelling not working. Other party can clearly hear my tv sound, my kid shouting.while on call...jbl just making people fool by saying active noise cancelling technology but what is this_ other party can clearly hear all nearby sound along with my voice. Planning to file a legal case against this since they are duping, defrauding customers."
4,"Well it's brand is popular, but it too has pros and cons:-Pros---*Crisp sound quality*Mic is excellent like mics of Samsung*No distortion even at 90-100 volume*Enough loudness*Noise cancellation is good at that priceCons---*Bass is not up to the mark treble is relatively high*Wire is also average gets tangled, but is manageable*No clipsThat's all thanks for reading, tag it helpful if you liked."
1,"Totally disappointed by the quality of earphone. It did not even stand for one year. One of the earpiece is not working.And above all that they have worst service centre in Hyderabad. I don't understand how can they tied up with a service centre (Sri Sai communication)  which has got so many bad reviews, don't they are worried about their reputation. I lost my money. I had a high expectations from JBl and Amazon."
1,"No noice-reduction feature, this makes it useless for talking on call.While talking on phone, my actual voice going to the other end is very little, instead the other end can perfectly hear my surronding disturbance. I have to hold the mic and keep it very close to mouth in order to let other person hear my voice. But my wife talking on phone in background can be perfectly heard by the other person on call."
2,"Here i mention few points about the product,1. Packing is good.2. wire is delicate, which may get teared soon.3. not having "" L "" shaped connector, due to this many times earphones get disconnected while keeping in pocket.4. Will be good only for music tat to with less bass sound .5. No option to receive the call in headphone, even if we receive manually the sound is low.6. After successfully using for year, i put it to dustbin as only right side headphone worked.Suggested product: boAt BassHeads 225"
3,"Writing this review after using these earphones about 6months. First lets talk about its pros-1. Best noise isolation in this price. As these goes really inside your ears due angled design.2. Good bass.3. Very good quality mic. And mic is at really close to mouth on right earbud. So you don't need to hold it to your mouth while calling. Also their is a button on mic whivh can be used to control music and receive/end the calls.4. Good Loudness.Now the cons for which i have given them three stars-1. Treble is really high. And you can't listen them to full volume.2. In some songs these gets very harsh u can't listen these even at 80% volume.3. Not recommended for longer listening beacuse of harsh sound and also as these goes deep in your ears, so you will pain after some time.4. Build quality is not that great.5. No volume control given on these only one button.Conclusion:-  I think these are ok earphones considering the price. These have good bass.If you increase your budget little bit you can buy one more piston fit earphones which have better sound quality and treble and bass is balanced but little less bass. Jbl c100si has high bass and high treble and better noise isolation.Also jbl c100si and c200si are both same there is no difference just name is changed are also price is high.......Update:Left earphone stopped working....lasted 1 year and 4 months , which I think is good considering my usage. I carried them in my pocket daily.."
5,"From an amateur`s  perspective, these headphones give the max bang for the buck. I use it 95% of the time for Zoom calls in WFH scenario now. Occasionally for online music streaming.Decent ambient noise cancellation despite having silicon tipsSlighly overpowering bass (typical JBL sound)Decent microphone, no complaints of my voice being low/inaudible on zoom calls"
1,I used to be a JBL fan but now the last 2purchases of headphones were terrible experience. Received a black JBL on 8th Jan 2020. One ear stopped working on 15th Jan 2020 around 3.15pm. Th noise reduction is so tight you feel you will go insane in that silenceNever hated any product purchased this far. Usually have a spare but this time the spare is lost n so many concall are on didnt think JBL will cause this much annoyance.REGRET REGRET REGRET
5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
5,"This smart wired earphone has good bass quality and the volume up-down functionality by sliding the volume bar is really cool. The wires as mentioned don't get entangled. Overally sound quality is really nice and fits in pretty well in ears. Used it for back to back meetings, faced no problem at all."
5,First of all I am a regular buyer of this brand..The type of material quality and the sound quality they have.... it is really amazing.I bought this product a week ago and again this is amazing at this price.The bass quality ....sound quality and also the noise cancellation all upto the mark.
5,"An excellent product. It is of lightweight design and of snug fit wired earphone.It have long durable tangle free cable.Easy to handle.It have Hi-fi audio quality with good bass. It is water and sweat resistant due to which can be used during gym, running and sports.It have passive Noise cancelation. Perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. It have hd mic for clear quality phone calls. It have wide range of compatibality with 3.5 mm jack. It can be used in smart phones, tablets, computer, MP3 player and laptops.One of best product in its range."
5,"I really love this I have compared to My original AKG headphones (it's ‚Çπ16.5k) PTron meet with it and disadvantage is we can't use more than 30 min with minimal sound 40/50% volume, I feel pain' on my üëÇ n it's little longer we can't use under the Helmet.Well packed and they even provided pouch on the package/ cap for 3.5mm jack and 2pair buds, cable also very good quality. Thanks to the seller üíö"
5,Positive things:>Mostly tangle free cause of thick wire>Robust enough to handle most of teens abuse be it pulling out of jeans pocket or bags.>Mic works just perfect even in windy conditions and volume control works like a charm.>Awesome bass and descent trebleNegative things:>Mid range sound could've been improved.Conclusion: Overall a perfect product for those looking for descent build quality and sound quality at this price range.
5,I mainly ordered it for online classes. It does its work decently. Thanks pTron for the good product and Amazon for one day super prompt delivery. I bought it in lightning deal with 199/- rupees and I am very happy. I have claimed for product warranty too on the pTron website and very pleased with the service. Hope to buy more from them in near future.
5,I bought this mainly to attend conference calls. This is really better than what I expected.  The audio quality is very good and fits perfectly.  Worthy product at this price and overall very good.
5,"If you're priority is noise isolation, go for these. Good bass. Awesome clarity. EDM lovers will surely love this. Noise isolation is just amazing. Just putting these on with no music will get you a quiet environment feel already. 50-60% volume and no outside noise will bother you. And that is in bus, as I travel a lot. I use these with my laptop, these work completely fine with no compatibility issues. So great earphones go for them...if your priorities are noise isolation and great music experience."
5,Earphones come in a cardboard box with warranty card.The earbuds shape is very comfortable to plug into ears.The sound is perfect with noise cancellation feature.I mainly use to for office calls and watching videos on YouTube .the sound quality is crystal clear .A good earphone in this price range .Must try .
5,A-one qualityNice noice cancellationClear audio while calling normal and video callButtons working wellAppreciable base quality at this range
5,"These are excellent for under 600. I own e10c, zsn pros etc and bought these since i had a cash back offer and i only had to pay 250.These are rebranded tangmai f3's, a somewhat unpopular chinese earphone and those sell for around 1000 on aliexpress.Coming to the review, the sound quality on these are definitely better than sennheiser cx2 streets, everything is better defined compared to them and i am genuinely surprised at how these sound. The only problem is that the sound is not clean. There is a lot of mid bass and no sub bass rumblings, Mids are muddied and sounds thin overall. But then again i am comparing these to earphones over 1000. These are probably better than anything in their price range."
5,"Amazing product.Hardware-wise: solid build quality(braided cable + metallic joints),lightweight,perfectly fit in ear(come with different sized earbuds shown in photo, nice case for protection(gives a premium feel),very strong wire.Sound-quality: perfect balance between clarity and bass, amazing noise cancellation,pleasure to ears,voice not crack at top volume.Summary: For the price range(i got it for 399), they are simply phenomenal for the quality you get in the product.Last but not least : timely(early) delivery by amazon + safe packaging."
5,"Used it for few days and realized that these are the best earphones i used till date. The sound is crystal clear, bass is quite balanced and quality of wire is very high.* Best sound quality* Bass is very good* Wire quality very strong* Crystal clear sound* Includes a pouch in the box* Perfect fit in the earsCons:-Not found till now"
1,"I had 3-4 earphones.I used Sennheiser, Boat, Boult, Ubon n sony earphones.Sennheiser is best, sony is awesome, Ubon is good, Boat is like goat, n Boult having manufacturing foult.Out of all The PTRON is simply super duper hit n best awesome good all type of qualties when we merge the Sennheise, sony n ubon.It meets below all 5 parameters :Sound Quality - 5 starsValue for Money - 5 StarsBass Quality - 5 starsDurability - 5 StarsBuilt Quality - 5 stars.Friends when my Boat earphone stopped working then I went to service centre to claim the warranty.They directly denied to replace the item saying stupid reasons.It stopped working within 3 months.But PTron is the best earphone for this price.I will suggest everyone to once use this awesome earphone to get the experience of 2000-3000 rs costly earphones.Thanks a lot.Conclusion - Don't think a lot, Go for it.....‚úåüëåüòäüòéüéØThe Upper review was before 3 months but now earphones stopped working and I was truated them that they will definitely replace the same.But now customer care number is not receive my call. And ticket is opened from 7 days.Worst service not expected from these type of brands.Guys it's an humble request don't purchase the local products. Go for brand.Think u purchase 3 to 4 earphones in a year of Rs 500-600 reach then why not purchase the only one earphone of One Plus.Just purchased the oneplua wireless bullets for Rs 2000/- they are simply awesome...Don't think go for it..."
1,"Sound quality-: terrible, couldn't even properly hear basic tunes in the music. In order to create a small amount of bass, this  'PRIDE' of ptron muddies the mids and the highs are almost none existent.Noise cancellation -: somewhat ok as expected.Value for money-: Maybe?? If you don't care about sound clarity and like a bit of bass then go ahead, you are the ideal market for these earphones.Microphone -: Is again terrible, people on the other end hear constant noise from my earphones when I play pubg with these.Overall rating is 0.5"
1,I have used the similar product last year which worked nicely for more than a year. So I purchased the same again in the month of July and within 2 months it stopped working. No sound is coming and I cant see any warranty policy. Dont buy it simply waste of money.
1,"When I received this product in the morning I was happy, but when I open the box and see the quality of earphone... I was disappointed. I thought that it would be better in the quality of sound output, but when I used them... I feel like I am using a Rs.50 cost earphones...I will suggest you to please don't buy this... Either you will not get satisfaction after having it...10 mm driver is a joke in it...And MRP of Rs.899 is really an amazing joke..."
1,"Very poor quality earphones. You can get these for Rs 50 on roadside. One side stopped working within a month. Return and complaint process too cumbersome, designed to tire the consumer out. My experience of Amazon India is opposite of what you expect in other countries, so do not hold very high hopes about customer service from either the seller or amazon."
5,"It has a MIC and bass which gives you clear Sound Quality, noise cancellation feature is also good, it is light weight and gives you a premium Feel."
3,"I would like to give it 3.5 stars. While the earphones worked fine initially, it is a bit delicate and can rip the wire from the ear piece if pulled accidentally. It did happen while i was just lazing around and managed to fix it by  re-soldering the wire. Wonder how many users would be able to fix it if such a thing happens... Still better would be to put a small drop of silicone sealant adhesive at the place where the wire exits the ear piece so there is no strain on the delicate wire."
5,"Nice Earphone üëç .I have been using this earphone for nearly a week and till now it's really good and the intresting thing I noticed is , this didn't get tangled much and it was easy to plug and unplug on the go .The sound is nice and for this budget range it's really good ."
5,I guess i really dont like this mic. I am gonna keep it though!! May come in handy some time else.. Not really the best buy if you want to record audios. the mic has the terrible airblast sound when you say P or B ... i guess a lavellier is a better option if you want to record audios. the headphones are ok. Does the Job. Its perfect for everyone who wants to talk over the phone hands free.... the product is not at fault at all here... Just wrong choice for me
1,Don't buy this product as the sellers and manufactures are not trust worthy.Worst thing I want to mention here is the after sales service which is very very worst and inspite of being in warranty period they will not give replacement of product nor the refund.It's a Waste of time contacting them for warranty issues.
5,"Would've given 4 stars(and that's a very decent rating as well) but I'm giving an extra rating for the price tag they're offering. I bought the Pride Lite earphones for 250 only and they do offer it at 200 on some days too.Sound quality is good, comfort is better( wore it for long hours without an issue). Mic works really good on calls don't know about the noise cancellation part yet but didn't have a problem making a phone call using these.One thing you should know is that the volume button is not actually a button but a slider which increases or decreases volume based on how much you slide it. But that too works well, no issues.There's also a 6 months warranty with this which you need to register on the ptron website when you make the purchase, otherwise you won't be eligible for warranty.Overall more than decent earphones, build quality could've been better but then you're spending just 200-250 on these."
3,Didn't expect much for the price but its great.Build quality 4/5Sound quality  3/5Bass 3/5These earphones have a braided cable throughout.100% tanglefree.Zipper pouch keeps it well protected.Go for it if you are on budget.
3,"Everything was awesome except the costumer care service.I claimed for my warranty and called them,the person said we have to courier the earphones to them. I was okay with that but after registration there was no update given to me. I called them the bot always says that the coustomer care executive is busy and it's all time! They don't reply my emails and calls. I would suggest you to go for boat they have very good warranty claim procedure and the delivery boy comes to your house for the pickup.After sales services are just terrible."
5,"I have purchased the earphone for my brother as he told me buy, it looks awesome. The bass quality is superb and its noise cancellation is also very good. Built quality of the earphone is excellent, and nice color."
1,Stopped working after  around 50 days. very delicate and low quality.I received an used item with improper packing and also there was earwax on both the buds. This is pathetic ptron. I paid for new earphones and received like a renewed one. There was also a crack on one if the sides. Sound quality is good at this price range but the problem is with the mic which is at a distance from mouth so have to take efforts to hold in hand and talk.
1,"I will advise you not to buy it if you are thinking to. It's the worst quality of earphones I have ever purchased. It cost me four times costlier than the earphones I purchased which lasted, with good sound quality, far longer than this. Its one bud stopped working just within a month though I used it with so much care. While my last one which was so cheap in price and handled with such carelessness lasted for several months. It didn't go according to my expectations, just waste of money. Now even for warranty availment, they will ask for money. It's better to directly get to the shop and purchase from there. You can find a far better earphones for very lesser price than this is for. I don't want someone else to be ripped off as I got."
5,I was looking for a pocket friendly headphone to do my zoom classes & came went for this one.The 1st thing that is best is the built in mic. Best quality. I never have to repeat my words over & over. Such a comfortable wired headphone with mic.The sound quality is quite good. I am nt a music person so can't say in details. But if you need a headphone for work purpose go for it.The tangle free wire & carry bag iare added benifit. Just through the small bag inside your travel bag Or pocket without worrying about the tangle headache.
1,"You will regret once you buy it.I bought this after buying the first one 4 months ago. First one stopped working and I contacted customer care. They told me to buy new product and they will refund the money for 1st one. I did that and now they won't recieve my call or respond to my email. I am done with buying ptron product now.What was the issue:1.The right side of earphone stopped working.2. when there was no music or video being played, there was a continuous noise coming, which stops when we play music.3. poor customer service.4. It is their very ugly strategy to make customer buy more of their products."
1,I purchased ptron earphones and within 3 weeks they stopped working. So I registered a complaint and they asked me to buy  new earphones which will be fully refunded. Now I have purchased new earphones and have sent them all the details they had asked for but now they are not replying. So for double the money I got one working earphones. I would suggest to go for a better brand as  in the long run these will cost you double or triple.
3,"Decent product at this price with good sound quality for average listening. Bass 7/10 Mid 5/10 Treble 8/10One and only fault is the sound is bit left inclined i.e. the left earpiece is bit louder than theright earpiece.Overall good for casual listening, Movies and Conference. Not for listening music."
5,"This ptron earphone brand has overall gained a good reputation overtime. As this earphone that o have ordered is a good quality product, with an adjustable sound button and microphone as well for clear audio during a call. The bass of earphones is very good if compared in this price range, the extra buds provided with the box are useful if they don't fit properly in your ears so you can use and change them. Overall a nice product with good quality."
5,Design and build up is really superb.sound quality is really awesome and bass is super.the earphone are light with good sound quality.the colour are very beautiful.i give five star to ptron because the mic quality is also awesome for video call and gaming as well .
5,"This earphone satisfies all the criteria you consider before purchasing an earphone. It has everything you need, from amazing sound quality to comfort and a table free cable. I would always recommend a wired earphone over wireless due to its never ending battery life. You can use this earphone to listen music and manage calls (as it comes with in-line mic). You get a 1.2m long tangle free wire which is of supreme quality and hence long lasting. Talking about the looks, the earphones have metallic look. These earphones also come with volume and song forward/reverse control buttons."

3,The lovely thing about this tws is packed features. Check the earbuds charging too. Mine right earbud  was getting charged continusly and was not getting fully charged. I think so some problem with the right one. Battery drains quickly. Sound quality is awesome. If you want to use for gaming in solo mode of gaming works fine but when you play with your squad and when you switch on your microfone on and off you will notice your bluetooth gets disconnected. That is the major problem with this earbuds. Rest everything is just great and even the built quality is superb.
1,It's was too large in ear and it's was not type C charging port it's micro usb port sound quality is good
1,Bad product with very bad response..Don't waste money.. instead go for ptron or boat..
5,"Earbuds of high sound quality at pocket friendly prices are hard to find.  This is the solution to that problem. Truke is pocket friendly and has a superior sound quality. The best thing is the 10hr battery life, but if used optimally it lasts even longer. Comes with earbuds adjustable buds which is great.Overall a good product!!"
4,"I‚Äôve tested all the brand sound . It has soft sound quality where it does not hurt our ear drum for longer time music play,  Ive bought and return many airbuds,  I concluded TRUKE is best sound quality and No.1 Ranked in this price range even below Rs 4000/-  Really thanks to Amazon. if we buy product  in a shop. There is not return or replacement option. But beauty of Amazon we can test all products and finally settle with one‚Ä¶ TRUKE is really true sound quality as per opinion, Go with High end model of TRUKE. With feature of noise cancellation. Excellent‚Ä¶ Making quality and low price range and competitive with high end brands also"
4,"‚Ä¢ Battery backup is greatüí™,‚Ä¢Connectivity superb üòä‚Ä¢Sound is superb (bass perfect not so loud but it's ok to feel and enjoy, trebble and music sound is perfect ) üòç,‚Ä¢Comfortable to wear,‚Ä¢Best deal for mid music lover not recommended for heavy music lover i.e those listen the music whole day . But it's best for listening music for 7-8 hrs or more a day normally or in travelling.‚Ä¢ Not experienced microphone yet. I will edit this later after use. üòä‚Ä¢ Case quality is also good. Their is a battery showing and charging showing display. With normal old charging type not type c.Overall worth it product. Best to buy during at sales or lightening deals."
1,"Sound not much good also having fault in right earbud, very low sound from right earbud, I log complaint but no response from truke.battery life is very good, but no use, I will recommend go with boat instead of truke."

3,It was a greatful to amazon for selling great products but when the order has came the box was opened inside the packet and then i used it it was clear in sound and noise cancellation it was working properly but the in the charging case it not chrge properly and the case was scratched even i told it to next dilivery boy he said sorry sir i don't know about what happen with your parcel and it was used buds because its power botton in the case was broken so i hope amazon u will be handle this issue but still i can't reporting a issue it was the falt of the delevry time
5,Good sound bass and great output fast charging great battery backup a must buy product in this price range. The connectivity is clear gets connected before wearing it. Very much satisfied with the product.
5,"Last year I purchased truke earbuds and still I am using it. Now I purchased a new stylish truke earbuds, and gave my old one to my friend. The sound quality and bass is so good, I listen to lot of rap songs, each and every beats are clear cut."
1,"Worst product I've buy from Amazon.. I can't even believe myself I'll be writing a review on Amazon one day..First of all, after a few days(2 days) the mic stop working. No one on the other side can hear my voice but I passed on that because I don't have much people to talk but recently the right piece started cracking sound too making it literally unusable and now that's too much. I can't used a single pair of earbud! I need refund! Or at least replace my item!"

4,The mic quality is ok not good no sound cancelation but good product overall.battery is Overpowered like earbuds don't even discharge 12(10)+36hr .It has 3 earpiece so you can find your best fit. you can feel the beats not like a headphone but still nice bass and cool treble. Connectivity is not 10 m but 10-15feets. charging is good and fast it idk y just takes longer at 80%. You have option aac but kinda use less for Android. Game mode makes its lag reduce and mic work but has to be activated before playing game. Dual mode or single bud both could be use.
5,This product is good and works well. The battery life is amazing and they charge fast. The bass is awesome to listen to music if you are a bass fan. The other thing I liked is the product comes with ear tips so you can put the one which you feel comfortable with in your ears. The connectivity is awesome just remove your earbuds from the case and then it connects automatically to the phone and if you are out of range and your disconnected when you come back it connects automatically again. Good product from Truke.
4,"Best battery life:Lasts about 5 hrs (for me) on a single charge. The case can charge it about 2-3 times.Mediocre sound quality:Sound quality lacks refinement, the base is good but there is a lack of depth in overall sound.Not the best designThe buds feel a little too big and therefore are a little uncomfortable to wear for long hours:"
5,I purchased these eaebuds just few days ago and I am totally satisfied with the product quality and moreover the voice quality is too good and battery backup is also very good but I just found Lil bit difficulties with the mic rest all the features are best and the thing I like the most in to get game and music mode in this price
4,"Like this, sound quality good, battery life also good, but not a C-type USB wire, simply micro USB wire, l bought  this product l got USB wire pin was fully damaged and  not charging to earbuds case."

2,"battery life is excellent , build quality is very good, look and feel is goodBut the most important thing is sound quality which is worst. I am extremely disappointed with its weird sound quality I bought this for gaming because they mentioned dedicated game mode. there is no difference in normal mode or game mode. I am even more disappointed coz there is no return policy unless the product is defective or packaging damazed purchase üòêüòê"
3,"Product does the job at this priceI bought for 999 truke fit 1+They tell this is german brand but earbud carry case build quality is not up to the mark that s ok.....if you think just a ear bud at this it s ok.......otherwise go some branded one like JBL ,BLAPUNKT ,NOISE.BOAT,REALME....etc...."

4,Good product for this price sound quality is ok battery life is excellant .don't expect hifi  sound quality .good packing not heavy in ear fits perfectly  value for money
5,Unexpected Sound quality .. not balanced sound produced.. sound is slightly in bassy side.. Good treble... Need to tweak in equilizer... Earbuds And case is very lightweight.. build quality very low..need to improve in build quality... Call quality average... Fit is very secure and noise isolation is ok... Overall value for money.
4,It worth all the penny for it's batter life... Audio quality is above avrg but no not that great.its  little big for the ears ...but fitting well... don't have that much cons other than this but battery life really impressed me...and one more...not recommend for calls....not only this...but also Every tws around below 1.3k is like that....but for 999 it's worth
1,Calling pe sahi se baat nhi hota bahot problem hota hai. I am not Happy in the product. Baki sound quality acha hai........ Service center wale chutia banate hai ......Mene wapas kiya but wo log wapas wahi product pack kar kai wapas bhej diya ...Call karo to pick-up nhi karte ...

1,Very bad products .. mic problem ..since day of purchase .. no after sales service .. there is no service center in Delhi ..nobody responding on customer care no..So please ..don't buy ..  very very bad after sales service
4,"Noise cancellation should be improved but overal the sound quality is awesome. If you a music lover like me then you definately go for it.Battery backup is also good , it's run 5 to 6 hr at single charge and with case it cover entire day entertainment . As well how much time you place a bud on your ear.Overal it's a value for money product."

1,"I dislike this product as it was not working to my expectation,  when calls are made or received I was asked by the other end that my voice was not audible and also when away from few distance within 10 meters voice disturbance and disconnection happens. Hence a bad experience from this product within 10 days of purchase."
1,"Review in short: Don't buy this productDetailed review: I purchased this item on 28 August.  As headphone had 92% charge I did not bother to charge it. Six days after the purchase I decided to charge as battery was low, and this is when I noticed charging port of the headphone has serious flaw as charging cable was not properly attaching to the charging port so charging headphone was completely impossible. I thought item I received may be faulty one so I immediately notified this to amazon and amazon agreed for replacement as it was the last day of replacement window. Today I received replacement item. To my surprise (nightmare)this time seller sent me used product. You can see in the photograph there is no lamination plastic on the box and box is manually closed with plastic sticking, even seller had tried to hide previous purchase label by sticking another blank label over it. I opened the box and again checked for charging port and realised there is serious flaw in the charging port design. Due to faulty design charging wire can not hold on charging port of headphone so charging is not possible. I immediately notified this matter including sellers fraud to amazon. Amazon accepted this problem and agreed for refund. My experience with this product was bad but I must say I liked Amazon's customer oriented approach and immediate issue of refund."

5,Very good bass quality. Quite satisfied with sound quality. Value for money product. Build quality is better than expectation. Highly recommended neckband at this price range. Go for it
5,This is my first ever purchase of Boult products and neckband also. I was tensed about it's quality. But after receiving the product I became happy with it's quality. The quality of product is very good and the battery backup is awsome it can run at 80% volume whole day with its full one time charge this is really impressive.

1,The worst built quality and audio too. I regret for this brand. I bought this brand first time. I will never recommend. All of you will regret why you have bought it. It‚Äôs just like 150-200 INR.
2,Replacement also same qualityBass is average and sound is not so clear.Build quality-very poor plastic with color coating. 700 rs is worth for it.No driver size is mentioned on the box n quick charge details are also missing.Charging port Design is pathetic because charger pin will not hold the socket due to closing rubber.
1,"The first item dropped connection randomly and the right side audio disconnects and reconnects randomly. Requested a replacement and seemed to work fine. But there are many design flaws.1. When you are moving out of Bluetooth zone, I expect the earphones to be silent. In this earphones, you get a load rrrrrrrrrrrrr  sound ( same as that  from radios when searching for channels) and when back into bluetooth zone, the audio is back.2. Sound  quality is horrible and there were drops in sound. I think this could because Bluetooth hardware in the earphones is not good.3. Battery life is reasonable but not comparable to my previous Oppo M31 which used to last me for full work day.My recommendation is instead of buying this for 1100 , add another 900 rs and get an Oppo or Oneplus."
3,"Brought this product after seeing many reviews.  Fast charging is ok. Distance not working  as mentioned.  Sound quality average,  not compatible for my Samsung f62 phone.  I brought Samsung buds plus for 4,000 which are excellent quality and working fine. . üëå"
3,"Starting with the negatives of this earphones is the sound quality the bass is not so thumping and also qui connect is Think also missing. But this product has a amazing quick charge feature i have never seen in this price segment.All in All , anyone who used to listening music with heavy or deep bass avoid buying this , although it has a enough flat bass which does not put it in a cheap product lines. Battery backup and charging is quite astonishing."
2,"this is my second purchase of wireless headphone of boult.first model was "" Boult Audio ProBass Curve "" and i loved it. it was damaged hence i went for new purchase.coming to point, i purchased  ""Boult Audio ProBass Qcharge"" for one reason - fast charging support through usb type .. the headphone performance is ridiculous.i infact made 2 purchases of ""Boult Audio ProBass Qcharge"" in 2 weeks, first i gifted to one of my frd. then ordered one for me.  i thought may be my unit is not performing.. checked frds unit. both are very bad in audio performance.. .in short , i suggest buyers to avoid this model. this is purely my opinion... i couldnt return it as i ended up damaging the original packing.. have i not have done it, i would have returned it to amazon..buyers still intrsted in exploring this model, take care of you packing, in case you want to return !"
3,I have been using this headphone since last 8-9 days.in terms of sound quality it's decent bass is ok ok types not expect too much in this price rangebut battery backup which is the so called main high light of this product is fake.it just takes 3-4 hours to drain the battery from 100% to 30%so don't go for the claim made by the company like fast charging or 24 hours music all are bogus claims
3,"Sound quality is good, and the set is well-made, of perfectly acceptable quality construction, and looks pretty sleek and elegant.However, I moved from a Boult Audio ProBass Curve Pro, and this was a major step down from it, as the Q-Charge constantly disconnected from my iPhone XR (sometimes even while on a call, or on the road) didn‚Äôt vibrate upon receiving a call, and generally felt less equipped than the Curve Pro.Furthermore, unlike the Curve Pro, which runs the earbud lines back along the length of the collar through a system of grooves in the collar (thus making it easier to keep extra wire out of the way, and keep things neat). So far, this is a system I have not seen on any other set out there yet.Missing the refined function of the Curve Pro, I returned this and ordered another Curve Pro.It‚Äôs another matter that the Curve Pro too has slipped a notch or so since I bought it, but overall still a better device than the Q-Charge, not to mention that despite it being advertised as having a 12-hour battery life/charge (as opposed to the Q-Charge‚Äôs alleged 24-hour runtime on a single charge), the Curve Pro returns a higher range of operation before it drains completely."
5,"This neckband is perfect. I am blown away by these. I have used many headphones in the price range of 5 & 6k but this is just similar to them in this price range. sound quality 10/10, battery life is also good, Durability is 10/10. perfect fit with no pain and no discomfort.... Really nice product with amazing music quality with superb bass in all highs mids &lows ..... Just go for it."
3,"I'm talking about my experience when I bought this product, Not to mention the sound quality is excellent, but .... The Qcharge I bought had no problem using it for a day But after that Bluetooth always fails pairing ( I complained about it and reviewed it here,I do not know if it is Boult audio agent called and asked to delete. I ordered  product replacement so I deleted it thinking that I would have to review it to see if there were any complaints about it.) Then I quickly got a product replacement. But the problem with that was the occasional sound cut :/I do not know if all the other models are the same :)And to put it bluetooth range I could not get 10 m distanceMentioned that the battery would get 24 hrs and but actually I got 6-7 hrs only"
3,Battery üîã backup not good and charging only 90 percent
5,"I've  used both boat rockerz 255 and boult audio q charge both are 799rs each during Amazon great indian festival, I'm sharing my 15th day after purchase.Battery backup : battery backup is around 14-17 hours when used with medium volume...I've watched 2 movies and played music for around 5 hours but still the batter was 57% left.BASS AND SOUND QUALITY: sound quality is quite good bass is as same as boat rockerz 255OVERALL REVIEW:I RECOMMEND YOU PEOPLE TO GO FOR BOULT AUDIO Q CHARGE IF YOU WANT A GOOD BATTERY BACKUP AND GOOD SOUND QUALITY UNDER 1K"
2,The product is good but the sound is not very good. but ok for the price. But the range is very very less. I have other BT headphone which works very very good with the same mobile. hence no mobile issue. my other Bluetooth headphone is Version 4.

1,"I have returned this because of connectivity issue, i already replaced this neckband with new one but same connectivity issue occured. I have cheeked with 3-4 smartphones but this neckband disconnect when we put mobile in pocket or when we move our neck left or right."

2,"Who ever scored bass quality more then 3,do not know how bass sounds in headphones,Its not upto mark as its mentioned in description,Apart from that, battery and sound quality is goodNoise cancelation works just fineIf you are bass lover then dnt buy, if u need battery and gd sound then this is the product"
1,The charging cable doesn't stay inside once plugged in. It just becomes loose and comes out by itself. Soundwise it is ok.
1,Not a proper audio quality it makes my head pain when ever I heard songs... that's why they are not giving return option they give replacement only...and also no customer service from this company... so people don't buy this company products... Boult
5,The neckband is working very well. It is durable and the sound quality is good. The charging slot is a bit loose but overall it is a great product.
5,"You can‚Äôt spell Bombay without local trains & music. And companion for both is music.XCharge was a gem of a find, because in the past, I‚Äôve damaged so many earphones owing to the rain. But no more! Super satisfied with this purchase"
3,"Product is not too good, you got normal base, sound. But battery back is about 15 hrs. I charge it for 2 hrs but still shows 90% charge, it never show 100% charge. There is problem is changing socket design.  It's hard to fit charger nob in socket."

4,The build quality of the product is pretty good. Also the noice cancellation works well but the charging port is not that perfect. Cabel does not fits perfectly in the charging port rest all is good
4,Built quality for this price range is enoughBass and sounds are nice. Battery around 2 days for less use. Seeking for an budget neck bands definitely go for it.
1,"Very fishy service, right side head set is not working and I am not getting any option to send back waste for nothing, where is your service provider in hyderabad. I need repair or replacement."

4,Overall the product is good I like it but there's only one disadvantage the wire of the earphone is little bit short it should have been a bit longer......
5,"Good battery backup and great sound like it ,Indian product just use 3 days recommend for youth and music lovers"
5,"First, I was mainly purchasing these headphones for the wireless and battery features. What I received was a great quality sound, and greater battery life than stated.Pros:- Battery Life - This was one of the biggest reasons for purchasing these headphones. I was looking for a set of headphones that would last longer than 4-6 hours and stumbled across these. I run the headphones for ~6-7hrs a day for four days. On the fifth day, I run the headphones until they turn off on their own. This normally happens around noon. This gives me a battery life of about 28-32 hours, beyond the stated 25 hours.- Great Design ‚Äì I fell in love with headphone, from the time I set my eyes on it. It is stunning looking and great design.- Sound Quality - The old headphones I was replacing with these were kind of tinny in sound quality. These headphones have really rich deep bass. I was extremely pleased with the sound.Overall, it checks all boxes for a stunning Headphone at a very affordable price. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
1,The product quality seemed to be Better in the intial usage but began to cause crackling noise.Has a cushion and beautiful design but functionally it's not good upto it's pricing.Note: Boltt also promises to give you a free movie ticket and gaana subscription if you upload screenshot of it's review on Amazon but cheats you once you have upadted the review.It does not give you the codes.
4,"This is a first impression for the Fire-Boltt Blast 1400 Over-Ear Bluetooth Wireless Headphones. Before you read further you should know that when you buy the headphone, you will get a warranty subscription along with a 3 month Gaana HD+ subscription and a free movie voucher for Bookmyshow. The only way you can register for warranty is once you have left a review here on amazon. Having said that, this impression is completely non-biased.Build Quality - The headphones are huge. I have a pumpkin sized head and I was pleasantly surprised that they turned out to be bigger than I thought. Build quality is superb for a headphone in this price range. The vertical and sideways swivel mechanism is smooth and sturdy making it quite portable and able to fit any head shape. The arching hinge is made of thin aluminium making it light, flexible but sturdy. The ear cushions are quite soft and don't irritate my ears at all. BUY A HARD CASE, so it always stays protected when you travel with it.Sound Quality - (I have tested the quality based on usage with my MacBook Air and One Plus 7T) The passive noise cancellation seems to work well. The ear cups work well in preventing sound leaking out and seeping in. Bass is decent. It is clear but there is no thump to it even when you max out your volume. The Lows could be clearer. The mids and highs are definitely crystal clear. I have tested it both through the audio jack and Bluetooth on both devices and the quality through the audio jack sounds better (no surprise there). Overall I'd say sound quality is quite good, not excellent nor great compared to other headphones in this price range. But the overall package added with the passive noise cancellation is great I'd say.If you can wait for the price to drop below 3000, then this pair of Headphones is an absolute no brainer of a buy. Considering that it is portable, wired/wireless and has passive noise cancellation, I'd say it will suit the needs of a budding audiophile cum music producer as well. NOTE - I don't know why the website says Google/Siri assistant built-in. It doesn't have that unless I am an idiot and cannot find it."
5,"pros- this headphone have great battery life- sound quality is also good- best headphone to buy in this price range just by first look- good customer service- After using for 2 months both ear-cubs came out of housing, and it was without single drop, but i got replacement from customer service.cons- it is beeping very frequently even if it have 30% battery remaining, it may be fixed by company after referring this issue in future, so it's not severe issue"
1,"I was impressed by the reviews on Amazon and ordered this product. Let me tell both the positive as well as negative reviews.Positive:I was impressed with the bass and sound quality and the quality of the product. Overall good.Negative:But after getting the product and using for a whole day, I got to know that there's a connectivity problem with the AUX cable from which I was able to hear only one side of the headphone, and also my callers were not able to hear me properly when I connected through Bluetooth on mobile. So I returned and got a replacement. But unfortunately, I faced the same issues and returning it again.It is up to you if you want to try the product and share your reviews."
5,"Review for Boltt Blast140I have used Sony,JBL,Sennheiser headphones beforePros:1.Ear-cups are comfortable and wearing for a long time does not hurt.2.Frequency response spectrum is quite good and the bass is also pretty good.3.The included cable for charging is long4.The Wireless connectivity is good5.In the wired format they have included a 2.5 jack to studio jack connector but the product also works with a dual sided 3.5 mm jack as well as dual sided 2.5 mm jack so yay for that.6.There is a thicker than usual layer of padding even beneath the ear cups which is a huge plus.7.Build Quality is really on par with the top contenders.8.They don't feel heavy for some reason even though they are said to be 390 grams probably due to the amazing padding on the head rest.Cons:1.Ears get a warm after 3 to 4 hours of use.(But do note that the conditions outside were also quite hot)2.For the same sound Intensity :Wireless mode ->100% volume ,while in Wired mode->60% Volume .3.Build Quality is good but the polishing work could have been better.So all in all the product is Built Well,Has a good Bass ,Frequency spectrum response is good(Balanced noise),Noice cancellation is also GOOD and it looks clean.Its Cheap at price at around Rupees.2800  but is on par with more expensive Headphones such as JBL55BT,JBL650BT etc."
4,Good
3,"Every thing is fine with the device in terms of blue tooth connectivity, sound quality, durability quality etc...I bought this headphones for recording audio. When you speak, each of your word is shadowed with notice or dissonance in the back ground. Sine my main purpose is not served i gave average reading of 3. Not only this headphone, but  the other headphones available in the market like mi, boat are also having the same issue."
1,"Initial reviewThe sound quality not seems to be excellent but under this price range this is awsome. Writing this review immediately after it have been delivered so not sure about the backup, Build quality is good , I have tried JBL headset that is  more costlier than this one  but the BOLT build quality is superior than other model with in same price rangeAfter one week :The charge indicator goes off after half an hour, I am doubtful that the headset is  charging even if its connected bcz the charge indicator goes off and I am not getting 25H of playtime mentioned it in the product descriptionAfter One yearOne of the headphone speaker not working now and outer leather wrapping start to peel off from 6 th month onwards"
4,"my point of view - i was mainly looking for a decent looking, solidly built, collapsible, with Mic, Good battery life, Over the Ear BT headphones at a bit reasonable price point of 3k-4k upto 6k around budget.Initially i only wanted to buy much popular brands like Sony, JBL, and other known brands.I found no headphones that was satisfying all my needs, a few are available but their mixed reviews stopped me from buying them.About Boltt Blast 140- So obviously this has all Those feature i mentioned above, and at this price point this is a good deal, sound quality is decent, the bass is okay, to make calls is smooth, battery(450mAh) life seems promising but this is something that will take some months to come to an opinion, becuase batteries show their true color after an year or so.  The pack comes with an aux cable and charging cable along with 2 perks(free coupons) to use and a Warranty instruction card.So far so good, will add to review in future.Update : this lasted for 1 year, after that it's one plastic hook that was broken and there was nothing I can do about.... It hanging now... But still working.  But can't fix that plastic part it is ruptured when broke. I am not sure if my daughter dropped it or how it got broken... So not commenting on it... But yes it has that kind of delicate mechanism there which may break if handled without care....."
1,"The product is okayish, more or less like anything else in the 2500-3000 rupees price range, won't go into technical details, once you bought the product you're on your own, if it works it works, if some problem arises, the one year warranty is nothing more than a scam, that's the problem with these disguised drop shipping companies, they only know how to import stuff and rebrand them with their own, the service is trash, the slider from both sides got loose and it no longer stays on the ears, been posted many times about all the details required on their website and mailed them 15 times and they said they don't cover it in the warranty, although, there's no physical breakage at all, I asked them about how and where to get it fixed as the slider design is not common, it's so annoying that first they give response after 10 mails and when they do, it's worthless it's okay even if it is paid repair, but they never responded afterwards. Better go for the top brands or independent companies if service is important to you."
3,"Pros:- Nice looks- Comfortable over the head and ear because of cushioning- fits well, length can be adjusted. Fits nicely over the ears- Got quick replacement which is working good nowCons:- Pricey for given set of features- Bluetooth connectivity is limited range. My other over-the-ear headphone bought at 1/3 price provides long range and strong bluetooth connectivity than this- Only volume and start/stop controls on the headset. My low end headphone provides next song / prev song controls too, along with pause- Even though covers the ears, doesn't reduce noise much (not that they claim, but was my expectation)- For the given price of INR 3400, more functionality could have been provided"
1,"I bought this headset all hyped from the info, but my experience was very underwhelming. First, the microphone was not working at all. it was not able to capture my voice. I requested for replacement and that was done very quick so hats off to amazon's service. The replaced one had mic working but it isn't reliable at all.its been a month of using it so here are my pros and cons.Pros:1. decent sound quality on bluetooth, gets better with headphone jack2. kinda have microphone.3. comfortable on ears.Cons:1. battery takes many hours to charge and doesnt last as long.2. Sound on headphone jack is better than bluetooth.3. Upon turning bluetooth on, stereo doesnt connect automatically, requires me to open bluetooth settings, disconnect, reconnect again and cross my fingers."
5,By just browsing on the Boltt website for not more then 5 mins it was confirmed that I wanted to but the Boltt blast 1400. The Headphones fit comfortably over your Ears and not on your Ears which is a big plus point . You won't find any other Bluetooth headphone in this Range that fit Over ears. Connectivity of the headphones are rock solid did not have a Single drop in the connection no matter what. The treble and Bass is equally balanced . There is no Sound cancellation hardware in these headphones however the Ear Muffs on the Headphones seal the external sound Upto 50 %. The built Quality of the headphones is above Average or Close to Good but not GOOD and definitely not excellent. The Buttons are located in the right place easy to Operate. It has a 6.5 mm jack for audio sharing which is my favourite feature  I connect the headphones to my Old Home theatre via Aux and play music wirelessly. The price of the product is definitely a Steal deal. The package includes a micro Usb 2.0 cable for charging and a 6.5 mm to 3.5mm aux cable for audio sharing .The headphones do have a Dedicated 3.5mm jack to listen to music if your headphones run out of power but no 3.5mm to 3.5mm  audio cable included in the Box. The box also incly few coupons for free gaana.com for 3 month and coupons for movie tickets. Overall it the best Headphones on this price range .
4,"Pros:1. Very sturdy design2. Long battery life3. Good audio sound quality4. Can connect another headset using Aux cable , so that same audio can be listed by two people at a time5. Comforatable with long usage. Could use it comfortably for continuous calls for 2-3 hours.6. Combination of wired and wireless gives added flexibiliy.Cons:1. Struggled to connect Webex on Widnows 10 laptop. The bluetooth mike does not work properly.2. Multipoint functionality does not work the way I understood. As soon as I connect my mobile, I can't hear the ongoing audio on my laptop which was connected and playing earlier.3. Many people complain to me that they can't hear me clearly on the call. I have to use my hands so that the voice gets directed to the mike."
1,Pathetic product from Boltt. Bought this to use to take calls using Zoom & Teams but it‚Äôs not working. Peanut can‚Äôt hear you as well as every few seconds disconnects. No noise cancellation.Even if fan is running people  can only hear lots of noise.In nutshell I would not suggest anyone to buy this if you wanted to use for taking calls. Buy it only when you just want to listen music. Even u can see delay in sync while seeing YouTube videos.
5,"1)Build quality Excellent.2) Bluetooth connectivity seamless.3)Sound Quality, perfection to fall in love.4)comfort ,hmm 10 min of usage and my ears feel very uncomfortable,might be it needs to be aged a bit.Overall it's a good headset .Above are my first impressions ,and used just for 10 min."
3,"First off when you see the headphones, they look premium. The comfort of the ear pads is very good and it even fits big eared people like me (No pain on ears even after use for 4 hours plus).The bluetooth range offered is also adequate, I could get the range for upto 20 feet, it was surprising as usually the headphones I owned before all could not provide such range.After a week of usage, there have been some loose screws and they cannot be fitted back in place due to some manufacturing defect hence I cannot enjoy the music , I believe the return/replacement window should be atleast more than a week, you cannot judge the defects of a product within a week. Would have been glad if I could get a replacement."
4,Fire-Boltt Blast 1400Giving this review as Boltt company has made it mandatory to register the warranty online.Forcing customers to give review is so ridiculous.Actual review will be updated soon.
1,It is like a bull worker on your head can‚Äôt bear it for 3 minutes one full music no.  No great sound terrible mic.  the package.This is  old Tecnology junk that costs 3500/ my sons 1800 bucks head phones have fast charging every thing in it is better than this. I decided to return it with in 5 minutes of opening and called Amazon.  These guys say their policy is only replacement.  I tried to convince them for half an hour another 10 minutes with the hire up of Amazon just did not work.  Beware these guys deliver junk With in 24 hours.  Now I need space to store it.All I am asking is replacement with another brand Amazon refused to do it.  It is better to buy in a store to avoid this kind of Cheating.
1,The first headphone had lots of crackling and distortion so a replacement was requested. The replacement arrived promptly but seemed like some one elses replacement piece or a refurbished one  . All the inmer packing was open and box was externally taped. The distortion still exists so not only headphones are not upto the mark but seller also seems to be shady sending out a used piece as replacement for a faulty ouece.
5,"TL; DR: Soft AND large ear-cups; medium-lightweight; good build quality; above-average music experience. Read further for a detailed review.The main factor for me while looking for an over-ear headphone was that it actually has OVER ear ear-cups. And I should say that it definitely fulfils that job.Pros:1. The foam in the headband and ear-cups is very soft (for reference, as soft as a mushy banana) and has partial memory-foam, meaning it adjusts according to the contours of the ears.2. The earcups are huge, dimensions (length/breadth of the oval): 10cm*8cm (outer); 6cm*4.5cm (inner).  2.1. They fully cover the ears, and one can keep wearing them for long without much discomfort.3. The above ensures a good passive noise cancellation though (no ANC). Since it fully covers the ear, ~50% of the noise is cut down without music played, and ~75% while music is being played.4. It has a well-built structure and good quality materials and leather used (haven't used for long but will probably last).5. The headband has a metal strip running along, so it will remain sturdy.6. It has good flexibility. It is highly portable, and at its smallest, the overall dimensions are less than 18cm*13cm.7. The earcups can rotate along 2 axes, meaning they won't be vertically protruding when resting the headphones on the neck and shoulders.8. They have both wired and wireless options to listen to songs, so not useless if the battery dies down.  8.1. The AUX cable provided (which is 6.3mm to 3.5mm jack) is 1 metre long (sufficient for moving around a bit)9. Because they have 2 audio jacks, one can listen from 2 devices at the same time (for this, you will need an extra cable)  9.1. Alternatively, your friend/peer can connect their wired earphones/headphones on the extra jack and thus you both will be able to listen to the same movie/music at the SAME time, which is an AWESOME feature.Cons:1. It has a MicroUSB port, not a USB-C port (but the appropriate cable is provided in the pack so not big of a problem)2. Sound quality is not the best in the market, but pretty good in the price range. Just that audiophiles might not find it up to the mark.3. After a couple of hours, one might have to remove them to get some ventilation as the leather material doesn't let any air in, and might cause accumulation of heat.4. It is mildly heavy, so after a while, one may initially feel the need to remove them for some time.5. Maybe not appropriate to use while exercising, due to the same no-ventilation reason.6. The controls (volume, play/pause) and microphone only function in wireless mode. When in wired mode, they are pretty much like any other headphone (not headset) in all types of utility.7. Good quality plastic and leather is used, BUT I feel it might get worn easily. I will update this review after a little while of use.So, guys, those were the honest feedbacks of my experience with these headphones. All I can say is the 4.2 ratings these have got are well-deserved and NOT a result of tacky business tactics like giving incentives for giving a good rating (like in the case of OneOdio).They are definitely valued for money in this price range and will give you a bang for your buck‚Äîa premium experience at a fraction of the cost of other branded products.If you're not an audiophile or music connoisseur who is looking for a top-class experience, I see no credible reason for you not to check these out.Good luck out there. Cheers!"
5,"Writing this Review after testing it for a Month and I'm amazed by it's Performance...If you are planning to spend Rs.3000 on Headphones then I'll suggest you to go for Boltt Blast 140 Headphones an they are Over-Ear Headphones which has some great Sound Quality, Clarity and Deep Bass and one of the most important thing it has really Great Battery Life (20-25hrs).Morever I only charged these Headphones twice in a Month and I've using it daily for about 2-3 Hrs ...When I was purchasing these Headphones I was in doubt that only 9 people have bought them so far and price is also comparable to JBL and much higher than Budget Headphones king BOAT but when I took a risk and came to know that my risk was totally Worth and really Appreciate Team Bollt for these Wonderful Headphones...üíØüî•üëå"
4,Sound quality is very good . Excellent for listening to music . Below average while using for talking to people after connecting via Bluetooth to your Phone. People whom you are talking to complain they cannot hear you . No noice cancellation and you can also hear whom you are calling with difficulty. Listening to music on this is excellent
3,"Absolutely great product for listening purpose but not a great for calling or skype meeting microphone in this headphone below average and when you are talking over the phone or in meeting with this headphone the person at another end will feel that you are talking for a very long distance so, call quality is disappointing and many times it gives trouble to connect a microphone with skype calls.Connectivity is great. fast connect and autodetect. sometimes I experience noise glitches in this headphone so, noise cancellation is so so.In nutshell, if you are looking for an all-round product which will help you in calling, skype meetings, and binge-watching then, you should go for a higher range like Sony but not this. but if you are using this only for listening purpose then this product is value for money."
1,This is very bad product in this range . Upper features does not match as shown in the description. In this product noise cancellation problem is very high . When I am connecting my headphones to my laptop and using internet in my laptop seeing videos & listening üéß the  music üéµthen  my headphone disturb the voice of online videos and music.please listen the voice of customer and I have no customer support and I call the customer care but no response for me. And many issues my headphone such ex I'm listening the music then suddenly between the music beep sound and beep sound is irritating when I listening the song. So I request please doy buy this product. I boycott this company
4,"Have been using the headphone for over a year now and I will rate it 4/5 for its price range. I purchased the black version of the headset and I have mainly used it with wires with little wireless testing.Pros:1. Very comfortable. I have a larger head than average. I also wear glasses so if your looking for a headset that's comfortable with glasses on, this is a good product2. Battery lasts as long as advertised. No issue with bluetooth as well as battery life till now (I primarily use it wired though)3. The bass is not the strongest but its there and its comfortable to listen to. If your not a heavy bass music enthusiast, then you wont go wrong with this headphone4. Blocks some outside noise while listening to something, but when its silent you can hear everything. I dont listen to excessively loud noises or music while using my pc and yet I have missed out on conversations towards me at times due to noise cancellation/blocking.  Noise Cancellation rating 3/55. The ear cushion material was much more sturdy than most headphones in this and lower price range. My ear cushions deteriorate very quickly usually due to sweating etc.Cons:1. Music quality is a bit lower when using bluetooth. I forgot the reason why but its best using wires2. The headband is made of plastic which breaks in  ~ 1 - 2months on high usage especially at the left/right rotating junction for both speakers. I had to stick mine with super glue to continue using it  (no longer able to rotate the headphones left and right)"
4,"Well these Fire-Boltt Blast 1400 Over -Ear Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with 25H Playtime, Thumping Bass, Lightweight Foldable Compact Design with Google/Siri Voice Assistance are good enough to watch movies & listening normal music (normal music) because these headphones doesn‚Äôt support very Heavy Bass like (Sony MDR-XB450 On-Ear EXTRA BASS) Headphones have. Even they have HI-FI SOUND & CAPTIVATING BASS  40mm large-aperture drivers... then also the heavy bass Games, Music, & Movies doesn‚Äôt sound good.Noise Cancellation is kind of okay not that great.Bluetooth Connection is good enough.Battery good on single charge & use of 6 Horus daily battery backup runs for almost 1-2 days without charging. But there is one problem too that as soon as battery level comes low at 30% the sharp beep sound starts. The quality  of Aux Cable is not good.All over these  Fire-Boltt Blast 1400 headphones are good but not that great...!"
1,"This  earphones are unreliable, i bought it before 15 days meanwhile right side ear buds got cracked automatically and it got divided in two parts, and sound quality is also not that much good but ok, one more thing bass is not good as it is a boat earphones.Guys,Also for the proof i have attached picsPlease see and think before buying‚Äã this unreliable product.Thanks."
3,No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.
4,"i bought itfor 999,I purchased it second time, gifted first one to brother. This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear."
4,"I'll get straight to the pros and cons of Boat Rockerz 255 Pro Bluetooth earphones.PROS:1. Sound- compared to the non-pro version, it seems to me that there's slight improvement in quality. Not that it is very noticeable, but a slight improvement.Bass- has got good quality and quantity of bass compared to others in the same price range. The bass is clean, tight and is not muddy like realme bluetooth earphones.Vocals- the vocals are clear and crisp.Loudness- it is loud enough to be heard in a noisy environment.2. Comfort- the earphones are comfortable to wear but without the ear guides. Maybe that's just me, but wearing along with the ear guides gave me pain in the ears which eased off once the ear guides were removed.3. Design- it is of neckband design that is comfortable to wear. The buds have got magnets in it which helps it stick to one another when hanged down so that no tangling occurs.4. Colour- comes in some trendy colours like yellow, teal green, blue and red. The youngsters would love this just for that.5. Fast charging- gets completely charged in just an hour and has got high voltage protection too.6. Sound isolation- nothing to brag about but comparable with others in the same price segment.7.Mic- the calls were very clear. The person at the other end told me that the voice was audible without any disturbances and indeed very clear.8. Connectivity- this has got the A2DP feature. So dual connectivity is present and I did not experience any connection drops of any kind.9. No Lag- there was no lag experienced while playing PUBG.CONS:1. Battery- this is the biggest gripe anyone could have with this earphone. The battery gets emptied quickly compared with its peers. Though there's fast charging one would expect headphones in this price range to last at least 10 to 12 hours but not Rockers PRO lasts for almost 6 to 8 hours. That's what I got out of them and that was not enough.2. Price- the asking price of 1599rs is high. You may get it for 1200rs during offers. Even then it is not value for money because of the poor battery backup.3. No auto on-off with magnetic buds- the feature which is present in Realme bluetooth earphones. This feature could have improved the battery life of this pair very much but alas it doesn't have it.Final words:Boat Rockerz 255 Pro bluetooth earphones are good in terms of sound quality and trendiness but lack in terms of battery backup. Though there are several pros than cons it all comes down to the battery life and this one loses out on that badly.Other options in the same price range - LoodAudio Everloop (good @1169rs), Boat rockerz 255( when in offer @ 999rs), Blaupunkt BE50(999rs during offer or even @ 1399rs), Sony WI-200( pricey @1699rs and high in treble), Realme bluetooth earphones(@1599rs poor in sound quality but better in all other terms).Thank you for reading.

1,"After 11 days, the charging port isn't working and now I can't even return it. Wat to do ?? I know there is one year warranty but it is only been 11 days. C'mon boat, please send me new one."
5,Its Awesome... Good sound quality & 8-9 hrs battery life... Just waww look... üòâ I brought just 999 rupees...But Amazon's Packageing system is Very bad... Very poor packaging... Flipcart's packaging system is much better than Amazon...
4,"Hey Guys,,,,,,, it's Value for money if you get under ‚Çπ1500. Bass was quite good it's thumping & Deep Bass tuned for Basshead type peoples. Vocals and treble also balanced if you used this below 80% volume. Instruments separation also quite nice. Battery Performance was Outstanding you got approximately 33-34 hours on 100% volume. While gaming little bit or minor delays in video & Audio but when watching videos on youtube or other video platforms on smartphone i didn't notice any delays. Also comfortable in my testing when using continuously 6 hours. Dual pairing worked. IPX7 water certification is good i tested it properly no issues. But you didn't get call vibration feature also no smart magnetic earbuds.I gave 4 stars because of overwhelming Bass on full volume.-:UPDATE CONS:- Guys still(9th feb) Using as primary earphone i Observed slight Hissss Noise in Background while listening music or watching videos. I observe more while not in use i means connected with smartphone but not in use or playing music. It's Big Con for a Audiophile type person. Keep it in mind before Buy."
1,Its sound quality is adorable. overall it was good but just for 2 weeks after that it stopped working and since then it never powered on again. I am claiming for warrenty and it is still undergoing.
3,After one month usage reviewing this .Pros-1- sound quality2- design3- weight4- batteryCons1- very bad mic for talking2- can't use while riding bike3 - Music is too loud
1,The product durability is 1 month..I just lost my bill details so i cant claim my warrenty .. But this earphones built quality is bad . It stops wrking completely after 1 month sep 14 to nov 11 üëà life span .. Dont lose ur bill details incase u want that warranty..  And after purchasing u must register ur product in boat's site for replacement and warranty
1,What on earth is the use of buying such product when it stop working in one month....your happiness sailed off like a BoAt.... #Disappointed
3,Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.
4,"Nice product,Rockers 255 pro is much better than Rockers 255....gud one from boat"
4,The sound quality is good. I mean it can‚Äôt be compared with Senheiser or Bose but its worth the price.Perfect to use while running; the earbuds are so comfortable that you wouldn‚Äôt even feel they are plugged in.
1,Right speaker is not working at all. Useless product.Big disappointment.
1,Product stopped working in a month time
5,"Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro."
5,Sound quality and build quality is good.. Battery backup is one of the best thing i liked in it.. Definitely you will enjoy the bass of this ear phones...
1,"Below average product. Not happy at all.Pros : good sound qualityCons : very uncomfortable, silicon buds are not soft. Bought a memory foam bud pair to use it.Battery life is just ok. Once give a low battery alarm, dies within 2 minLittle heavy on earsNo return possible"
3,"The product is a good buy if you are looking for a decent Bluetooth earphones with a reputed brand.Sound quality 4/5)- pretty good with good amount of bass.Durability (4/5)- the material seems durable and the earphones are light weightBattery life (3.5/5)- It has a decent battery life of upto 5-6 hours playtime on 80% volume.Connectivity (3.5/5)- gets connected with seconds but sometimes gets disconnected within a small rangeCall quality (3/5)- call quality is decent, the person on the other end of the call can here you clearly however you need to place the mic exactly near your mouth. Sometimes the call gets distorted."
2,The product is not worth for 1500/- rsYou can get maximum sound but no quality.It seems they have worked hard on Volume level but not on sound quality.Packing was good.Delivery was fast as it took only one day to deliver.Two stars for packaging and delivery.
4,This sound and bass quality is good battery life good noise cancelling is good but its wire is too long and uncomfortable which is not looking good wire is starting from top its looking bad but anyway everything is ok
5,"Got it today, really loved the product.. awesome sound.. i was thinking to buy the Airpod but a friend suggested this to me.. Why spend so much!! So i ordered this and this really is amazing.. it looks good.. have great sound and doesnt hurt ua ears!! I am totally satisfied with this and couldnt say about battery as i have got it, today itself!"
1,Rightside speaker stop working within 20 days.
1,"Although sound quality is good, but then whats a purpose of buying a wireless earphone when its controls (buttons) doesn't work. I bought this product withing a week controls where stop responding cant switch on or do anything.replaced it got refund bought another piece different color that worn out in a day.Both the time seller was "" Appario Retail Private Ltd"". So i leave it to your wisdom whether you want to buy this or not. I will never buy this brand at least from this platform."
5,Don't you guys check the product before selling ? just received the product and one side of the earphone is working and the other is not !
3,"he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality."
1,"As falsely claimed by Boat, doesn't have AptX. Could not use the AptX codec to play music on my phone.Though, decent bluetooth earphones for the price.Additionally, Boat products are not listed on the products subsection on aptx website. This means, they don't support AptX codec.Ps: Have used other AptX devices on my phone successfully."
4,Overall good!But I am unable to connect two devices simultaneously. Please Guide how can i do that.Thank you!
5,"I am a prime customer of Amazon and I always purchase a product after so much research bought these boat rokerz in the sale in 1099 and trust me I am blown away by these I have used sony and other headphones in the price range of 5 & 6k but this is just similar to them in this price range ""sound quality"" 10/10 ""battery life"" seems good not tested for as described but will update soon ""durability"" 10/10 perfect fit no pain no discomfort.... Really boat has done a fantastic job with amazing music quality with superb bass in all highs mids &lows ..... Just go for it."
1,"Let me tell you about the product in Details,1. Sound Quality is good. It is harmless for ears. Not too loud but traffic noise can't disturb you while listening music.2. Look is awesome but wires are too lengthy.3. Battery Backup 'WAS' awesome. Six to seven hours after 1 or 1.30 hours chargingBUT4. Product is not CHARGING AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS OF PURCHASE. And it is not acceptable. That's why the rating is ONE (lesser than one is not available though)I will change my ratings and review too but after the replacement or refund against this product.And one more thing, do not put too deep to this thing in your ears, it might be painful after few minutes.RegardsSIDDHARTH"

1,"No matter what is excellent in a product, it doesn't matter if it doesn't turn on after a day.You guys are enforcing a replacement for a failed model.We can't keep working with warranty and keep the product in manufacturer's shed for days.Got shut down in two days. Boat needs to review this product.Bottom 14% reviews say the same problem, issue with charging.I have purchased 5 boat devices so far I am disappointed for the first time because of this product and ""enforcement"" for replacement.This leaves me no option but to stop believing in BOAT's own customer service for the problems posted by customers. Amazon just play with its policies. Its the manufacturer who needs to go beyond and hel it's customers.Refund me for this defective product and I would like to purchase a new one of different model or make."
1,"The item has been rendered defective three times in less than two months of usage. The first two times was due to charging issue and the third time due to sound distortion. Being under warranty, the item has been repaired the first two times and now I have registered a compliant for the third failure. The product has spent more time at the service centre than I have used it. Am completely dissatisfied with the reliability of the product."
1,"I have boat rockerz 255, I got my younger sister boat rockerz 255 pro..This one I bought for my younger brother..And guess what among the 3...These ones are most expensive and yet the worst soundwise...Even pro sounds better than this pro+..More battery, different not better design..and faster charging can never make for poor sound quality compared to predecessors.."
1,This is very uncomfortable to wear as it is large in size.It's laterally coming out of the ears.You can't ware helmet while wearing this.it is more bad more painful.Bass is too loud... instrument separation is bad.Not worth the price.Only colour of the product is best...and rest of the things are worst.Go for another one.
2,"Boat blue tooth 255, ye doubt Voice quality is amazing for 30 days or so you will be big FAN or Boat but after 30days.. voice from of the side going down and even after 35 days you will not be able to hear anything from one sideBoat Service on same again so pathetic , raise an complaint almost 10days back  for replacement or rapair but after 10days its reaches to their rapir center, not sure how many more days Boat will take to repair... Big Suggestion DO NOT BUY THIS"
4,"Height adjustment is good but not suitable for a small head. Cable quality is good. Very thick cable. RGB LED of RG logo changes loops wise, It looks good. Mic quality is good. The bass is super cool but the audio pitch is little low. Awesome for gaming. Worth buying at this price range. Comfortable for long uses. Earcups cushion is good. Covers full ear which makes it more comfortable."
5,Great headphone for the price (799Rs is what I paid)plz don't spend more than that.the ear cups are large (and yes the circumference of my ears is huge hahaha) and comfortable. Earlier i had bought the cosmicbyte one (Rs1200) and they had small earcups so wearing it for one cs go compi match was a painful experience.  ..if you don't have a headphone or if you are in search of a good not so expensive headgear  I would suggest go for it. The in built mic is also very clear.( I personally use a mb800 condenser mic)..
5,"Best gaming headphone under Rs.1000, I got it for just Rs.798 (I got lucky I guess). go for this if your budget is low.It also has amazing bass to it..but you have to lower it in the sound setting when you have to play game like pubg..I hear footstep and can recognise where the sound of bullet is coming from...this headphone has improved my gameplay..the headphone is not that heavy...at start you feel heavy but after 10 min you will feel nothg...amazing good quality headphone at lowest price."
1,DON'T BUY THISI don't how people are writing good review about this headphones.  This headphones are really really bad. The sound is TOO LOW. I can't hear anything in any games. In PUBG PC the footsteps are not audiable at all. Even while playing music also this headphones don't perform well at all.When I first ordered this headphones the first piece was defective and the right side was not working. The replacement was given but this is complete disappointment.
3,"I'll give honest review to new Buyers. I bought redgear cloak in September 2019 for ‚Çπ899. Its a very good headphones no doubt but but but , every coins has its down sides. So first let me share my good experience about these headphones. I mainly bought it for gaming like pubg , cod , minecraft etc. The build quality for 900 rs headphones is much much better than most of other existing headphones in the market. The quality of RGB is amazing but the effects are random you can't control RGB. Another good thing is you got a volume controller on headphones itself. it's also got a 3D sound effect. Now let's talk about the downside , the sound quality : the sound quality isn't best enough its just average + my headphone's right side driver was producing very low sound volume which is very annoying. Secondly you need a Audio + mic splitter for using it on mobile which cost you extra bucks. The last thing i faced with this issue is its Audio jack stopped working after almost 7 months of use and i didn't get the replacement yet because of the ongoing lockdown. Hope redwood interactive will replace my unit as it is under 1 year warranty. After my opinion headphone is about okay okay and I'm rating 3 stars for it.Pros1. Beast build quality.2. Aggressive pricing.3. Damn good RGB.4. Eardrum cushioning.5. Auto adjustable headband.Cons1. Low quality audio jack.2. Unbalanced volume.3. No 3.5 mm jack.4. Too big for small ears.5. No RGB controller."
1,The product box was completely damaged!Worst delivery ! I guess they have put some heavy products on headphones or treated this product way too harsh. There were also scratches and smudges on headphone like it was used by someone. Other than that headphone was comfortable and nice.Reall poor delivery by Amazonüëé
5,I've been using this for a month now and I can safely say that it's a legit gaming headphone.The sound quality is dope :‚Ä¢ The bass is perfect for hearing footsteps‚Ä¢ The treble is also really good cause the sound of gunshots don't distort even at high volumesThe cushions on the earcups tho is starting to go flat (not much but just a lil decrease compared to when it was new) but I think that's what happens when you use it for a long period of time everyday.Highly recommended from an fps gamer.
5,"I am writing this review on 30th Jan 2020 after using this product for 3 months.I am a casual gamer and mostly bought these headphones for playing both competitive and offline games and since I was in a tight budget. The sound quality is great and I can clearly hear all sorts of sounds needed in competitive matches (footsteps, reloading etc.) The volume is good and usually, you won't require more than what is providedThe only thing which could be improved can be the mic. This bendable thing can make most mics malfunction quickly than fixed mics. But you can't expect everything on an 800 bucks Headphone.Finally, I would definitely suggest you get this mic if you are tight on budget.You can always increase your budget and go for better Kotion Each or Cosmic Byte headphones for RS.1200 and above.EDIT: So after 1 year and 1 month of usage, I am finally ordering a new headphone, the problem in this one being that the leather covering on the cushion fell off, causing irritation in the lower part of my ear."
1,"If you plan to use this headphone on a new age laptop or a gaming console like Xbox or PS4 it will not work as it has old style wiring where there are 2 separate jacks for sound and Mic which most new laptops and consoles do not support. This is not shown in the pictures.Also Amazon does not accept return of this product so once you buy it you are stuck with it.Edit: Amazon did make an exception and accepted a return so ""Thank You Amazon"""
1,It's just too heavy.  Even adults cant use it for more than 5 minutes.  You will certainly become a Cervical spondylosis patient.  There should be some standards for such devices for health safety.. this one is a big health hazard.  I have not used other gaming headphones but buyers must consider the  WEIGHT of the headphone before buying.
1,I am writing this review after 3 month. The head phone looks good but the quality is not that good. The 3.5 mm Jack that connect to the pc showed some issue after a month of use as the cable is not braided and the headphone cushions are good but you will feel pain on your ear after some hours of use. If you want a headphone then go for a braided one. Never expected this from redgear
5,"I bought this Headphone in November Starting for my personal work and I have to say that this is one of the most comfortable and best headphones you could get under Rs.1000 .I bought this for a price tag of Rs.899 and I really feel that it is value for money product .You might be thinking about what are the pros and what are the cons of this headphone , so I have mentioned all of the pros and cons below -Pros (Advantages) -1. Very Comfortable Gaming Headphones (The first moment I wore these headphones , I had a feeling of joy as the cushions in the headphones were so soft and it really felt like I could wear it forever :D)2. Clear and Crisp Sound Quality3. Strong , Durable and Good Quality Cable4. RGB Lightning is unique in it's own way5. Perfect Design which gives premium look and feelCons -1. After wearing for almost 4-5 hours ,  I felt like my ears were paining a bit , but now I think I am getting used to it , so It would vary for every person .2. The microphone does it's work , but the recording quality of Microphone is not that good.At last I just want to say that if you are looking for a budget gaming headset , then you must go for this one .Even if it is under Rs.1000 , GO FOR IT!!I hope this review would have helped you guys in deciding whether to buy this product or not .Thank You!Have a nice day :)"
4,"First of all very bad n pathetic packaging/handling by Amazon. But due to no damage to product I didn't returned it.Now about this product, is actually good even it's imported from China it's distributed n marketed by Indian company Redwood's Interactive based in Mumbai.1. For gaming if your compared it with other headphones in same price category it is good but not so loud. While gaming if your game or hardware can output more audio then it's good cause this headphones can go more louder with amplification.2. As I said audio is good but not loud for 2.1 stereo sound. But if you are watching any  7.1 audio channel video then it's really feels good.3. For comfort I have used it for more than 4-5hrs with allgrown hairs(thanks to Lockdown) n didn't feel any problem as cushioning is good and comfortable. Also earcups are large n deep so you don't feel any pain + it feels light weight.As per price to performance ratio this is perfect headphones with RGB.Let me know if any one have questions regarding it."
3,"Before I offer my critique about the product, I would first want you to know that products below 1,000rs are known to be limited by something.If you've used any headset before and were pleased with the sound quality, then you wouldn't like the Cloak.The headset has some very important flaws that competitive gamers need to consider:1. It's got low sound output.2. Directional sounds are not clear. Sometimes when the enemy is on the left, the sound may seem as though coming from above or below.3. Muffling sound. When firing weapons, the audio can drop to a very low level.4. The headset doesn't know how to handle multiple audios. It tries to compensate by automatically lowering the volume of multiple audio.The better part about the headset includes:1. A decent microphone2. Comfortable3. Cost-efficient4. RGB lightsHowever, notice that the headset is first a good audio delivery tool instead of a style element.If you have been gaming for over 2+ years, I wouldn't recommend this headset."
1,"Very very bad in comfort..Bhai jab kaan hee dard karenge toh fir aachi sound quality ka kya mtlb, jab 20 minute se jada  pehan hee nhi paoge toh ese headphones ka kya faayda, isse aacha toh cosmic byte ke hee le lo bhalae hee thodi build quality kam hhh unki par kam se kam comfortable to hh, long time tak pehan toh paoge..YouTube pe jis-jis ne review kiya h unki mat sunna unko toh paise mille h toh aacha hee batange..Mai bata rha hu na inn headphones ki reality...Mai toh pachta rha hu, total waste of money...üò´üò´üò´üò´üò´üò´üò´üò´üò´üò´"
2,For an under 1000 INR headphones it's passable. Sound is not loud so need to push windows volume full. Design is quite attractive. RG logo shines with light loop preset.As far gaming the headphones are not comfortable for long hours. It pushes your side a bit hard and lead to slight headache.Volume Rocker is built in.Mic is ok ok as it need to put quite close to the mouth. All and all its an passable product. For hobbyist it's a steal in this price range. It has the best design in this price range not too flashy not too bore.Serious gamers don't buy.
5,The headphones are great but there are 2 jack instead of 1 so you have to buy a converter (Rs100-150) from your nearby local store if you don't have 2 jack laptop. Otherwise the audio is great (for gaming only). Don't expect too much bass as it is a gaming headphone. The RGB panel on sides has 3 LED bulbs fitted inside which change color from time to time and make a great looking addition to your gaming set-up and isn't even too costly. Recommend.
5,"Awesome product...When I first saw them, I was like they are soo big.. but when you wear them, ah the comfort üî•I played with this on for like 3hours continuously and I didn't feel any discomfort.Sound quality is pretty good but they are not very loud or maybe they have noise cancellation technology idk but I have to max the volume almost everytime .Rgb is very good and bright changes colours automatically and is pretty bright tooo..Overall just goo for it.."
5,"GOOD FOR dealy use comfortable cushions I used for almost 7 to 8 hours for playing csgoBut sound quality is not good for gaming .cosmic byte gs410 s sound quality is way better than this headphone but this headphone offers a good comfortCons- surround sound is not good traking enimies in cs not ez with thisNot 5.1 or 7.1 sound ,dont expect at this price pointMic quality is very nice my dad use this headphone for singing song on starmaker and the quality is of songs come way good"
5,"I generally don't bother writing reviews, but I just wanted to appreciate this headphone. I mean for the price the headphones sound as good as I can really imagine. I have used the G430 before ( which was sort of mid-high end for it's time), and really coming to these earphones I really cannot say that they logitech sound better. These can get surprisingly loud and still sound crisp. I am no big audiophile but as a CSGO player, I don't think I have ever found myself complaining about the sound. I have carried these around often, it has often fallen off from my desk, I have pulled its wire hard, sometimes it has even got under the roller of the chair, yet the wire hasn't snapped or any issues whatsoever. Thank you redgear! I really liked this product."
2,"First of all, if I was judging the headphone based on looks, comfort and build quality.(5/5) Nothing and I seriously mean it, nothing comes close at this price range. They are perfect accessory for a gaming rig and that's all. Sound was too low when I got it; I thought it was faculty, so I replaced it. And second one was same as well. Sound was soo low I had to turn equaliser to max on all channels just to hear foot steps in games. Hence, I returned them as sound was priority for me.In conclusion, if you want a RGB gaming asthetic headphone only for the show buy this. It's cheap but looks way better. There is non customisable RGB, they are really big and will enhance look of your rig. But that's it no point in buying for gaming or audio.P.S. If they re-release these headphones with better audio, I would buy it in a heartbeat even at double the price."
5,It is quit decent deal . Mic is pretty sensitive catch up background noise good for audio recording of we edit for stream for startup it fine but need more improvement in noise rejections of back ground ... CCTV mic condenser are great for such a application if company use... I am engineer and create circuit so as this aspect I recommend such good product for gaming or as aid .. dac improve all over performance ..
1,"When on a video call or voice chat, the person on the other side can hear himseld through the headphone mic.Confused?There is so much sound bleed through the headphone, that the mic pics it up! The person on the other side of the voice call can hear the leaves outside your house brushing against each other and they can hear themselves through the mic. And the mic, oh god. Constant thumming sound because of the ceiling fan. Sound quality is terrible. You'll have to use equalizers to make any use of this.I later realised only the left side was working. This was due to the bad contacts on the headphone jack. This was also creating an audible ""hiss"" even with nothing running on the PC. Probably due to the hyper low quality mic picking up all the ambient sound in the neighbourhood.The ear cups are huge and soft, but immediately create a lot of heat around the ears the moment you put them on. I have a large head, and the ear cups fit me well and prevented any airflow in or out of the area enclosed by the ear cups. This however, did not prevent all the sounds from around me from leaking into the ear cups made for a bad audio experience.Build quality is okayish and the headphone looks fantastic. No braided cable though. It has three inputs, a USB input that powers the RGB, an audio jack and a microphone jack.It's HUGE and screams ""GAMER"". The RGB is beautiful, and almost every penny of the 899Rs that you pay for it went into the RGB looking good. Because nothing else seems to matter to Redgear, or most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers that bought this piece of trash. . As an accessory, the Redgear Cloak will look beautiful on your gaming table. But as a sound output device, it gets zero points.I will be replacing it right away, because unfortunately, there are no returns.Edit: Ordered a replacement unit that worked fine for 2 days and then the mic just stopped working, and the headphones keep disconnecting again. Returning. Worst experience I've had on amazon so far."
4,"comfortable earcups, covers whole ear.multi coloured lighting on each side. (not customisable)mic quality is poor.build quality is great for a 900 rs headphone.the sound has a weird 3D effect to it. sure, this helps to locate enemies quickly in FPS games but it takes some time to get used to this new effect, and there is no option to turn it off or disable it, trust me i tried.great for listening to music.takes some getting used to for gaming."
1,I am a pro Counter Strike player and i had alot of difficulty to hear the footsteps of the enemy. Dont go for this product for gaming. Comfort is 90/100.
1,"DON'T BUY THIS.I could tell a detailed version of my story but it would get boring so listen up anybody who's reading this: Redgear has the WORST customer service in the world. There is no mail address (the one on the box is an automated one where they won't monitor your mail) so the only ways to complain about a damaged product is either calling them, upon which my call was cut thrice, i repeat THRICE without even listening to the problem, or fill up a complaint form provided by them, upon which i was told that replacement option is not available at my address. See where i'm going?I REGRET buying this heavily."
1,Such a disappointing product for any price segment. Very bad sound quality. Mic doesn't work. Very heavy... You could break your neck and sweat like a pig. They are very brilliant..they don't provide an option for refund because they know how bad the product is. And not at all for gaming. Not even a bit. Please spend a little more if you are looking for a headphones that can give you better sound while playing FPS games.
2,"Pros: Good bass, good volume level, great for listening to music and zoom meeting, comfortable for someone with a small head.Cons: hard to distinguish the footstep direction, above and below sounds the same, especially for games like Rainbow Six Seige where sound matters a lot,most annoying thing is the unbraided cable, whichs tends to curl up a lot after a few months of use.Update: The headphone  pin has loose contact doesn't work properly and  the cable curls up too much."
2,"I know this strives to be a budget friendly pair of headphones.But as a person who has used millions of gaming headphones before,I can without a doubt,tell that this is not something you should be after if you want to use it for hardcore/competitive gaming. I personally play a lot of Apex Legends. As a competitive and a full time Apex player,I was in the market for some good and cheap headphones. But these failed to deliver what I wanted. The volume is really low. I had to install 3rd party softwares to manually tweak the audio and the volume is still very low. This means that you cannot hear footsteps. Talking about the mic, it does the job. But after 2 months of use, it started to echo my voice. Also, DO NOT BUY THIS if you want to vibe to some music. Overall, I would give this a 5.5/10. If you want some GOOD gaming headphones, you can go for boats immortal 200 which costs around 1.5k or opt for a pair of cosmic byte headphones which are also really good and also cheap."
2,The frequency response is terrible. The sound is echo-y.Use in ear headphones as they are better at this range.The microphone are good.The headbands are a bit too tight and the cups are a bit small. They start paining a bit after a few minutes for me.I didn't think of tuning the equalizer in software to compensate for the terrible frequency response.These product come under the replacement but no return category so I would advise not to risk it.It's a waste in my opinion.
1,I will not recommend this to anyone venturing into gaming and streaming.The mic is awful and the headphone drivers are utter trash. Voice is crackling and not clear. Treble is very high and bass is pretty non existent.
2,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
5,Don't let the cost fool you this is better than any other 1k earphone by famous brandsm. Philips is good old manufacturer who sells to most other brands.
5,Good earphone in this price range
5,"Writing review after using them in the worst possible way for 6 months...- Dragged on floor- Crushed under my buttüòÖ- Soaked in water for an hour ( forgot to take out from jeans while washing)They still work like a charmAlthough I didn't expect such quality while buying, I guess that's what Phillips is ! QUALITY"
2,I don't know whether my my piece was a fake one or not but its quality was like a 100rs earphone. Plus the left side stopped working after 1 week or so. Soundoutput is bad. Just bad for me. retutned it to amazon
5,"Best earphones in the price under 400. Before this i had order boat 225 earphone which was costly and worst earphone cause it was itchy and paining in the ears so i returned it. I think old is platinum so i gave chance to Philips brand. Nice sound quality, microphone also good. Made in china mention on the microphone and it proves again that why the chinese manufactured products are good.Not for those who are looking for higher bass quality sound.Simple made earphone,  build quality is very lighty which i like it. So go for it...."
5,"I got this on November 20, 2018. Today is April 10, 2019 as I write this. Nearly 5 months using everyday for hours on end. Still working on both earpieces. I hope it works up to 1 year... That will be awesome. I will update when it stops working."
4,PROS:Good Sound QualityComfortableBuilt In MicrophoneCall Attend ButtonDeep BassOk PriceYou get an philips brand
5,The sound quality is surprisingly amazing.. never expected such fantastic performance from such cheap earphones. Phillips is a trusted choice when it comes to earphones and music systems. However the thin wires don't seem to be much reliable for rugged usage.P.S. to avoid disconnection of wiring from earpieces due to unintentional stretching just put a small knot (semi tight) just short of all d three ends which can absorb the shocks ib themselves. See pic
1,With in 11 days the speaker got damaged and not working now. Poor quality in sound effects. Waste of money. I think this is not original philips and amazon is supporting for duplicates. Don't go with Amazon .Please.
5,"Many reviewed like poor bass and sound quality but the fact behind this is, it has higher impedance value. so for the low end phones or devise whose output power from 3.5mm jack is less you cant except a great quality audio from this earphone. if it is connected to a little high end audio device or to a amplifier then the output will be superb.For me the sound is comparatively less when compared to my boat and another Philips over ear headphone as they have low impedance value (between 16 to 24), but when connected to a guitar and keyboard amplifier the sound is awesome. the other two headset mentioned above produced a noisy sound when connected to amplifier."
2,Right earpiece stopped working in a month!! Sound quality is excellent! If not for that right earpiece it was a 4.5 star
1,"The damn thing doesn't work.It became useless for me in just a week's time. If I am not wrong this would be my first Philips product which stopped working within 5 days of working. It gives disjointed sound, there is a irregularity in the sound. There has been not mishandling of the cord or the headset but Amazon would not take it back because the return window is closed. This kinda short window on return of electronic goods is quite unjust because we do not buy things out of pure necessity and hence sometimes when one procures a product, he or she takes a week or so in opening the product or strat using it."
4,"I bought this on 8th Aug,2020. And it certainly stopped working on 18th April,2021. As this earphone comes with an warranty of 1year, now I want to see what warranty can do. But I couldn't find any window where products within warranty period can be contacted. So I'm not sure how much warranty period means for philips or Amazon. Consider this point while buying because if you aren't interested in warranty of the product, this same quality product you can get in less price."
5,"I bought this second time, My first one I gave to my brother and now I bought it again because of my brother is still using it for the last 7 months, At this price with this sound quality is awsome don't look for anything else just buy it without any hassle. Don't get confuse with any other comment"
5,"Voice quality is perfect, nice bass and mic works perfectly. Very satisfied. Worthy of your money."
5,great earphone. good bass ever I heard from earphones. good noise cancellation microphone and earphone. helped a lot while driving a bike. earphone sits perfectly in ear. no pain even after long use.  thanks to bass quality and noise cancellation I can enjoy listening music and can take call even in crowded streets.
1,The sound quality was good but within 6 months they are not working. You would expect the amount of money you are paying would give you something reliable.
4,"ANNEXURE 6 Dec 2020 -One bud is gone today! Just 3.5 months!? Shame...1. It seems a jenuine item and a good buy. Box wasn't sealed though, and not sure if that's how it should be. The item is new alright.2. Sound is nothing special but it is fairly good. Perhaps the output level is a bit low.3. MRP on box is 399. At 299 - I am happy.4. Earbuds are of a good design - comfortable and easy to wear. But it's difficult to identify L n R sides.5. Mic is good.6. Cables are soft but sturdy. Sets of extra coushions are included alright.7. I find NO mention of warranty info anywhere! This is confusing and concerning.8. The box is very highly oversized. That's a lot of paper wasted. It's totally unnecessary. Philips should consider a box of one third size."
5,"First of all, I'm an audiophile, I've used Sennheiser,Sony,beats,AKG,Audio-Technica,Bose,1more,JBL, Skullcandy etc branded in-ear earphones.Currently, I'm using Sony XB55AP (rs.2399/-)  as my daily driver... I needed a light weight cheap earphones just for Google meet. Considering the price, I didn't expect that much from this pair of earphone. But when I tested it ... I was SHOCKED !!it's really good for rs.325/-Many earphones like Boat bassheads,Leaf etc costs (500+) ...  I tested it with connecting ASUS Vivobook 15 and OnePlus 8 Pro... It's surprisingly good for the price it charges ... Mid tones are good, Bass is satisfactory, Treble is also fine... If you need a great earphone then go for Sennheiser,Sony etc ... But if you need a good earphone in cheap price, and you're also concerned about brand ...(Philips is an old and trusted company)... Then this is the one YOU SHOULD GO FOR !"
4,"Unlike the V sound signature of other headphones below 1000 budget, this one is balanced. Something like the sennheiser cx180.It's not like the bass isn't there - very low frequencies are amplified and mid-lows are flat. Vocals are perfect. Treble is just there. Can listen to audiobooks all day which is why i bought this.The mic is a bit lower than desired but those who hear me in call isn't complaining."
1,"Voice recording using mic sounds like you're being heard in a Radio.Sound quality : is terrible, like you hear when a speaker is kept inside a bucket.Absolutely Ridiculous.Durability : I used it for hardly 40 minutes for two days. On the third day it worked in the morning for 20 minutes, I kept them aside and used after a another three days and Boom!... Within a week's usage (approximately) one earbud stopped working. Disappointing beyond all measures.Value for money : I had a pair of earphones that I ordered before them for HALF the price, and they lasted for FIVE months. Their sound /mic quality wasn't the best but was DEFINITELY better than this crap. Money wasted.Conclusion : I bought a joke."
1,"I had the same earphone which i purchased from local showroom and it worked fantastic for more than 6 months.  Now one of its ears stopped working, so I ordered the same earphone from amazon, but it doesn't work properly. The sound quality is poor and the connection at the end is loose, so I literally have to hold and press it inside the earphone port of my phone or laptop to hear properly. Utterly disappointing!! And they don't even offer return or exchange policy, maybe they are selling substandard or rejected earphones online, that's why no return or exchange is being offered."
5,"This product has 10mm drivers and provide rich bass with balanced mids and treble. So for any music genre, these will be helpful.Product quality is good, mic is sensitive enough for general talking but not as sensitive as Philips 2405.Using for a long period does not cause any harm (if you listen music at low volume) and earbud quality is good, not very easily breakable as some more 'aggressively marketed' products have.Down side is warranty of 6 months only and this product cannot be registered to the Philips website. I guess for warranty issue, we have to call the vendor not the service centre. So, keep the invoice copy with you.Overall, a just enough good product with decent sound quality but nothing special about to be mentioned."
5,"At first I got the used product without eartips and then I placed it for replacement, then I got the new one, it's sound quality is amazing, bass is also punchy, no muddiness in bass and no distortion in sound even at 100% volume, but I recommend you do not use any earphone, headphone above 60-65% volume, more volume can explode your eardrum if not then definitely you're gonna get tinnitus problem in which a person feels whistles in one of his or her ears, sometimes it's left and sometimes it's right one. Now coming back to this earphone, the build quality is ok, do not expect more because these are coming under rupees 300, it has basic build rubber wires and plastic jack and mic, wire isn't looking durable so you have to keep it with care, do not fold earphones wire to tight otherwise it's inside copper wire can break. But if you keep it safe then you're gonna enjoy this earphone because of its great sound and bass quality, it's mids, highs and lows all are balanced, so you're not gonna have too much bass or too much treble it's balanced. If you find my review helpful then kindly leave a upvote, it gives me motivation to right more reviews to help other fellas. Thankyou and enjoy shopping."
2,Came to know after receipt of the product that it is made of China... Although I searched while purchsing but could not find the manufacturing country.... Purchased Phillips understanding that it will not be from China...Very much upset that I did a big crime betrayel to my Indian Soldier...Request Amazon team to information of origin of country on the products while purchasing...Request other fellow Indians not to purchase this product...This is China made
4,Overall satisfied with purchase. Sound is decent for an entry level model. Bass and mids are ok for this price range. Mic is also working well. I use it for online calls with laptop and 3.5mm mobile Jack.Both left and right buds are identical so I randomly insert into ears. However cable quality is average. Recommended üëç
3,"It's good for Rs 270. Please don't try to compare it's performance with Sony products which are available for just triple. Brief summary as follows:Pros:1. Strong build quality ensures durability.2. Good bass level.3. Inbuilt microphone.4. Bud cushions of three different size are given in package.5. Loud sound with good bass.6. Tangle free wire.7. It's a Philips original product made in China.Cons:1. Sound is loud enough but lacks clarity.2. Good bass level with less melody.3. In air buds causes irritation after some time.4. Caller at other end complains low voice during calls. Overall not good for calling.Conclusion:Good for budget conscious but useless for hardcore Sony lover. It's useful to watch videos on YouTube, but if you are interested in music then go for SONY."
4,"dont expect too much from it but still i am surprised at the decent sound and bass quality it delivers at this price. packaging from amazon was kinda OK.. but still it was fine.you can definitely go for this headphones without a doubt if u r on a tight budget. i have used senheisser, boat, wecool, sony xbr.. so trust me when i say this, it definitely delivers above average sound quality and bass.. philips has always met my expectations no matter how small or big it is."
1,I purchased this product in June 2021. It stopped working all of a sudden in Oct 2021. It comes with a 6 month warranty. I am trying to claim the warranty. But neither Amazon nor Philips has been able to give a concrete solution. Amazon just dumped me with 5 toll free Philips customer care numbers out of which 3 is not even in use. The other 2 numbers gave a set of 3 more numbers. Each number says that its not the relevant phone number and they keep passing on the blame to other. The quality of the product is also not that great. I regret having bought this from Amazon especially.
1,"The sound quality is good so it can work good as headphones rather than one with Mic. I didn't believe it will be such a poor quality that person can't hear properly. Don't buy as you can get better one from competitor like Boat which last for long time without any issues.In short, not worth to buy with Mic, can work good as headphones"
4,"When it comes to earphones, Phillips always ended up coming through.I went through multiple cheap earphones that would break down within weeks. This is the second Phillips ear phone I bought and the first one lasted nearly 2 years! I am enjoying this second one as well!The earphones fit comfortably in the ears and don't cause pain when in use. They connect to the mobile phone, the laptop and the tablet and provide clear voice and music in all of them.Max. My issue is that after a certain point, the buds fall off if by mistake you stand up while connected to the laptop. But they can be easily attached back. If you lose one, there are spares buds provided.The buds are also easy to clean and maintain. No worries, no problems. Go ahead and try it!"
2,I have been using the old Philips She earphones (the spectacularly low priced o es with excellent comfort and bass) but had ro buy this since the former is out of stock. This earphone is very uncomfortable especially if you use it while lying down in bed. My biggest issue is regarding the comfort or lack of it while using it especially while sleeping.
4,The headphone fits nicely and comes with additional 3 pairs of different sized ear plugs. The mic is crisp and quite audible from the receiver's side. The cable could have been better. The audio is good but the BASS is very much overpowering resulting in not a good listening experience.Can't complain much considering the price point at which the item sells.
3,"Overall product quality is good at this price range. Good quality sound it is delivering while watching movies or listening to songs. Though the headset has very good response over a wide range, it's noise isolation is not much good. When it comes to headset, noise cancellation is very important, because when we use the headset, if the surrounding sounds are irritating to listener in the other end, it will be difficult to communicate.I fear that in long usage, it's joints may break, the company needs to work more on this side also. This is a most common issue with normal headsets."
1,"Pathetic product do not buy at all!I used then 7-8 times hardly and they were gone, no sound nothing, better to go with MI only, even if they are 50 bucks costlier they at least function for 4-5 months h der heavy usage. Either this product is fake or Phillips is not what it used to be at one point of time."
1,"Sound Quality is very bad. Producing troubling noise from Right side earphone.Poor audio calling. This will happen after 30 days. So one cannot replace in Amazon and will be forced to Contact Phillips Customer care.Phillips customer care:1. Worst and very rude behaviour. Pathetic experience.2.. Don't have any mindset for replacing the part.3. They even scold you for telling that product is not working.4. You have to go to Phillips service centre 10 or more times for resolution. (Service centre person response: If you want come, this is the rules)"
4,"Clean, clear crisp and detailed. Hope the specs are also displayed on the website as printed on the box... Like 20hz~20khz, 103db, ect. The description by the seller says noise cancelling - this is not true. Noise cancelling headphones are of different construction and build quality. This is Philips and recommended for its genuine quality and value for money always. I recommend, and the bass quality is pretty good!!"
5,Crystal clear sound much better than what I had expected at this price range. 300 bucks is nothing! Sound better than (or at par to) a JBL headset i used which cost around Rs 800. I'm satisfied with the earphones. Will test the mic and update later. Mic is average I suppose but it will serve the purpose at least in emergency. Philips is a Dutch brand so I knew it would be a fine quality product. Unfortunately it's also made in China like all other brands.
4,"One of the best earphones, and that too this cheap. Definitely recommend to go for it without having any 2nd thoughts. I have tried boat, MiVi, earphones, bluetooth headset, and airpods and let me tell you, they all let you down. For an awesome gaming exp I got a Cosmic Byte Gaming headset that surprisingly turned out to be insanely amazing. Just out knocked it out of the park. But since it's a complete headset, it falls in a very different category of listening devices.All in all, if you are looking for an amazing accessory for very affordable price, do go for this without waiting for a 2nd opinion."
5,Product built quality is very good and wire length is quite long so i can easily move my neck around..i love the sound quality of product.Its very light weight and battry life is also very good...Overall love the product and in this price its full value for money product..
1,"Zero product, worst customer care service, product was faulty , i made the request to the ptron site, mailed them, but didn't got response even after waiting for 15 days, the number they mentioned in theri website  didn't connect , not even once, and the service center is in Hyderabad, far far away from agra city, so it was a total loss of 500 indian rupees, but it provided me a lesson that don't invest in cheap products and companies , cheap will always be cheap.Worst experience."
1,"This product is only suitable for YouTube streaming for educational purposes only... Absolutely sucking sound quality... Poorest of the poor in terms of sound and those who gave it a 4,5 star might haven't heard music ever in their life... Pathetic.. just keeping it as alternative for online classes in covid 19 times."
1,"Well, it was broken in two days when I tried to remove it from my neck. Then I thought that I can still use it for a walk but now the plastic cover over the charging slot does not open, maybe it is fixed with glue. Shame on Amazon for selling such 3rd class stuff.Update - Last week other side was broken as well when tried to remove it from my neck after a morning walk. This time I had to click a pic and post it. This is stillbworking though as those tiny wires are still connected but i bet won't last very long."
1,Poor meterial..sound quality seems like very cheap headphones like you will find out in the street the may cost around 100 rs.. as it is a made in india product..still I would suggest and expect better quality in near future.. looking forward on serious evolment in their range of products
4,Bought this product on prime day for Rs 499. Overall a good product for this price.Pro's:Good build qualityClear audio qualityGood battery lifeCon's:No bass at allSound frequency is lowOverall a good neckband to have under Rs 500 (except for the bass).
1,"I'm writing this after using for 1week& Returned bcozVery poor productPain in ears due to the design of earbudsMic is worst, trouble while in callBattery stands for maximum 2 hours after charging 1hourVery bad don't buy"
5,"PROS: 1. BATTERY (LIFE AS PER MY NON-STOP USE) 9 HRS TALKING AND LISTENING MUSICS, VIDEOS. 2. CRYSTAL CLEAR SOUND QUALITY. 3. LITE WEIGHT, YOU NOT EVEN FEEL THAT THE NECKBAND IS THERE. 4. WIRE LENGTH IS SUFFICIENT. 5. BLUETOOTH COVERING AREA IS ALSO VERY GOOD IN COMPARE TO OTHERS. 6. VERY FAST CONNECTING WITH PEERED DEVICES. 6. CALLING SOUND QUALITY IS ALSO VERY GOOD.CONS: 1. BASS IS NOT ENOUGH (DUE TO FITTING ISSUE), 2. NO NOISE CANCELLATION IS THERE. 3. EAR BUDS ARE NOT FIT TO EAR PROPERLY. YOU FELL THAT BY HOLDING THOSE TIGHTLY WITH YOUR HANDS. I AM USING THE SMALLEST RUBBER GRIP THAT THEY PROVIDE AND SOUND QUALITY IMPROVES LITTLE BUT THE PROBLEM IS STILL THERE. 3. THE SOUND IS NOT LOUD ENOUGH WHILE PLAYING VIDEOS, I TRIED IT ALL KIND OF VIDEO FORMAT. YOU NOT ABLE TO LISTEN PROPERLY IN OUTSIDE AND CROWDED PLACES.OVER ALL I LOVE THIS HEADPHONE CONSIDERING ALL THE ISSUES."
5,There is no doubt it is very best product. When my 3 friends recommended it then I buyed it and after receiving that product I really shocked sound quality is just impressive really loved that product
1,"I don't like this earphone at all, bass is missing, sound is soo sharp that it hurts ear and creates headache...im using redmi k 20 pro, so it this earpiece is not at all good for this phone...ispite of making all sound settings it is impossible to get a good sound. While calling, the receiver gets low volumes, so i prefer calling by my phone only.Really disappointed üò≠buiyng earphone from market is a good option, atleast we can check it before buying, n can select the good one.Wired earphone is much much much better than this tangent lite bluetooth earphone."
1,Purchased on 29th may 2020. Now right  earplug is not working.. truely chinese.. it is less then 7 months .. It is a ok product for Rs 799. But unfortunately i was misguided that this is a MADE IN INDIA product. This is a MADE IN CHINA product and i was looking for something that is MADE IN INDIA. BE VOCAL FOR LOCAL. AND I REQUEST AMAZON TO MAKE IT MANDATORY TO MENTION MANUFACTURING COUNTRY.
1,"I have been using it for 4 months or so, since Aug-2019, but the left side speaker has stopped working. There seems to be some loose contact and if I try to move the wire around, then I sometimes the sound sputtering out of the speaker. The usage has not been much heavy in terms of handling as it is generally lying around my neck the whole day and only taken out at night. The buds are put in the ear just while answering the calls and are just left downwards otherwise; the magnets in the earbuds ensure that the buds remain in place. So given the handling, the build quality is poor. Or perhaps the design is fragile as I feel that the wires get stressed out when the ear buds are not in ears but just left down.Second issue is that the device silently gets powered off, especially after ending of a call. Its a problem especially if used while driving as you would not hear the ring at all as the device has turned off.Overall, not happy with the product.Update on 28-JanThe second speaker has also stopped working. So it goes into trash. Company is not reachable for so-called warranty."
1,"Don't waste  your money on this brand...surely the band looks good but build quality is very cheap and terrible. My headphone only last for month before it's left ear piece stopped working. Even I tried reaching pTron Customer care, to claim warranty but after 3 weeks of back and forth emailing, I realized they never interested in providing warranty, it's their strategy to drag feet so that customer will give up after some time.Pathetic product and even worst customer care, don't fall for attractive pricing as product is not worth half of that. You will regret buying this."
1,I got the headphone at 899 it‚Äôs working good only 2days after working only right side. I‚Äôm really disappointed i put replacement request. Might be seller send to me a refurbished product because product come damaged box and also dust particular on headphones
1,"Product is overall good and there is no compromise with the material looks. But if we talk about the sound quality which is the main feature of the product, it's not good at all. The voice is not clear and on the very first day the product is not working. So I returned it back. But Amazon service is fabulous üëå."
4,Worth every penny.Phone calls - 9.5/10Music - 8/10 ( bass is just fine )
3,I am writing this review after using this product for almost a month. Quality of sound and noise cancellation is very good. The issue I have with this phone is that it does get disconnected by itself esp. after the end of phone conversation. Though it does get connected automatically immediately but often it goes into power off mode.Please take care of this issue and then it is 5 star.
1,I re-ordered product as first product that I received stop charging in 5 days. Then I placed request for replacement  and second product that I received has very weak wire that broke down during fair usage.  Cheap and very useless product.There is no rating for quality. I would have given zero star. Pls don't buy this product ever.
1,"Totally rip off, it only took 3weeks at best to get one ear piece dysfunctional. Extremely cheap and not trust worthy at all. [21st Nov, 2020][Value for money wise it is ok. The sound is a bit mild. Bass is good and noise cancellation is better than expected.But like my previous experience packaging was poor. Very poor. The box was almost flatten on both sides, it could have damaged the product.My humble request to Amazon is, please start paying attention to the packaging. If it's a low price product, does it mean you handle it with lack of care?Please do consider packaging products a bit more seriously.] 1st impression [1st week of Nov, 2020]"
5,"I need a headphone which sounds quality is very high & I got this in a very good price . The sound is absolutely perfect & bass of the headphone is also good. The best part of its better backup which is a very important thing in neckband , you can use this approximate 4-5hrs after full charge & it's charging capacity is very fast."
5,"I had ordered Ptron products multiple times and its gives me ultimate satisfaction from the products. I had earlier ordered In-ear headphones with mic and now this one round neck wireless Bluetooth headphones. Its an amazing headphone, Noise cancellation is good, quality of the neck band is very good. we can twist and turn the neck band and it does not break. The earplugs fits perfectly. The vibrant colors are just amazing. Sound quality is prefect."
5,Quality: product build quality is good.light weight.easily fit into my ears.Connection: it supports long distance connection.Battery: battery back up is 6-6.5 hours.
5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.Sound : 5/5Bass :5/5Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)Battery : 4.5/5.  Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.Over all its a good deal @ 699/-Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
5,"I bought 2 of this Bluetooth earphones for me & my friend for our daily workout inside and outside. The earphones fit well as I move around during my workout (sprinting, running, exercising etc...). I've tried similar earphones with similar price points in the past. And, the overall sound quality is well balanced from bass, mid to treble all across compared to others. I liked the light weight element of this product for my purpose and liked the sound quality.Overall, this product is an excellent buy if you are looking for a reasonable price with good quality sports earphones!"
5,"The main thing which I found very fascinating about this ptron tangent beats neckbandis that it's battery backup which was 7-8 hours on watching series and just requires 90-100 mins of charging.As for the sound quality, it is pretty good along with active noise cancellation and good fitting. The bass is also pretty well. Bluetooth connectivity is good with approx 10m of range after that the streaming isn't precise."
5,The product just wonderful Amazing sound quality.fits perfectly in the ear. It is very attractive and useful for me. It has best bass and quality is awesome..good product with price range value for money.battery backup is good..*Overall recommend neckband go for it*...üòòüòò‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
5,"These Bluetooth headsets are great in this range for both use on iOS and Android with quick pairing. The sound quality is very good specially for Bass lovers, and are very comfortable as they are light in weight and you get different sized eartips with them to fit properly in your ear."
5,It is my first Bluetooth Headset.1) Build quality is very good.2) Battery back up is decent.3)Very nice and clear sound quality and Bass is also good.4) You will not feel any pain after a long use of the headset. It is very much comfortable.
5,"I bought these to run and it was important that they be specifically good for running. And they are great. Exceeded my expectations really. The sound quality is excellent. Far better than i'd expected from this price point. And certainly more than enough for my use case. The Bass is great. The design of the earbuds are also great. They don't fall out that often while running. The bluetooth is great. No drops. The battery life is great. Lasts for a few hours comfortably. And most importantly, they are perfectly symmetrical so it feels balanced while running. This is a huge concern and is one of the reasons I went with this design. I have only just bought them. If there are any longevity issues, I shall update this. If there are no updates, assume it was been working great and I've had no complaints!!UPDATE: One of the best purchases I have made. This is perfect. All the sweat and wetness does not seem to bother it. Violent flailing about, if I'm running with them out of my ears, have also not been able to destroy it(yet). The sound quality is as good as wired earbuds twice its cost. Gets as loud as you need. Battery life is more than I expected. Does not fall out of my ears. Perfect fit. The earbud turns off automatically 5 minutes after I disconnect the bluetooth and this is amazing because the only button i have to press is the power on button  and its great for convenience! This is a great product here. I've been using it for about 3 months now and not even one complaint. Good stuff man. Keep it up."
5,"I'm Using This Neckband Headphone For the Last Couple of Days. It Has a New and Eye-catching Design. Besides It Feels Really Nice in Hand and It's Durable, Thanks to Its Excellent Build Quality. It's Pretty Lightweight and Flexible and You Won't Feel You're Using a Neckband. The Earbuds Fit Snugly in Ears and They're Magnetic. There's Some Extra Pair of Eartips in The Box to Choose From. It's Very Comfortable Even For Longer Times of Usage. Battery Life is Nice too. It Offers Upto 6 Hours of Music Playback, That's Really Nice. Latest Bluetooth 5.0 Has Been Used Here That Ensures Longer Range and Stable Connection. It Also Has Quick Pairing and Low Latency Streaming. The Mic Quality is Excellent. On The Right Side There's Three Buttons to Control All The Operations of The Headphone. The Sound is of Very Nice Quality. The Bass is Superb in It. Overall It's a Great in Ear Wireless Bluetooth Neckband. Worth Every Penny."
5,"I like the colour combination as it is different from the same monotonous commonly available black bluetooth neckbands. Another thing that caught my attention are the sleek ear plugs. Wearing earphones for a long time cause my ears to hurt. But the sleek design of this earphones is its biggest advantage as there are no more ear and neck aches. Last but not the least, I loved the audio quality of both calls and media. In this price range, it can give a tough time to more expensive but similar performing Bluetooth earphones."
3,Reviewing this product after one day. Got it for 699 on 6/7 Aug sale. The qc should be done more well as you can see in last pic there are two white spots on the earphone. Sound quality is descent considering the price. Bass is good. Don't expect boAt level bass. But yes it's definitely good. You can feel the thump. Treble is also good. But can find some distortion at full volume. But it nowhere says bluetooth 5.0 on the box and also don't say low latency on the box. Overall decent earphones if you are on budget.
4,Overall good product ....clear vocals but bass slightly lower side....build quality is decent.
1,"The microphone did not work for me with my laptop. It was working ok with my phone, but the microphone voice was a bit low. The device starts complaining about charging when there is about 30 % of charge within two hours of usage with full charge and it lasted around 2-3 hours. Just because the box in which it was delivered was destroyed accidently from my side, I was not able to return or replace the item. I also wrote to them through their site explaining the problems. No response yet I am not sure why it has so high rating, I have decided not to go for any Bluetooth headphones based on such a terrible experience!  They say it has one-year warranty, but they don't even reply to my emails!"
4,"I got it for 799/- within 24 hrs. Using it for 10 days now, don't have much complaints. I will sum up in pros and cons after my experience with the earphones. Reducing 1 star for the first CON in my review below.PROS:1) Cheaper than some of the other earphone brands with 12 months warranty as well.2) Good Audio quality, I found it was better sounding than an Over the Ears Headphones I have from Cosmic Byte (G4000). Clear sound and good audio reproduction.3) Battery life serves good at least for my taste as I am not a heavy user (I generally use it 2hours a day max.). Just FYI, I have charged the earphones twice in 10 days.4) Comfortable earphones with very less weight and good ear fit.5) Mic quality for calls is decent, not much noise cancellation for background noise but whatever is sent through is very clear and accurate.CONS:1) Biggest con for me personally is that I can't watch online youtube or twitch videos with this one (usually have to go 360p or lower for smoother experience) as it hampers the wifi speed on my mobile when connected to the mobile via bluetooth. This is happening because my wifi router is 2.4Ghz and it is interferring with the bluetooth signal to reduce internet speeds. A simple 5Ghz router would solve this issue, but as I don't have it, its become an issue. Also, I can tell if you run videos from mobile internet then you don't face this issue.2) Only SBC bluetooth audio format supported hence not the best audio quality.3) Left and Right ear plugs always confuse me while wearing it on, also the length of left and right side is not exactly the same, slight mismatch is present, which goes to show poor quality checks from the company.4) Battery life could have been better or atleast charge time should have been reduced. It takes 1.5 hrs charge time for 6-8hrs battery life.5) Battery indicator is very wrongly calibrated. From 100 to 70% discharging, it takes 5-6 hrs playtime, while from 70 to 10% it takes just 30 odd minutes. This again shows poor quality checks from the company."
4,"Looks wise: DecentSound quality: GoodNoise cancellation: Great, as compared to many other branded co. bluetooth earphones this product won't disappoint you.Even when you are on a call you can hear the receiver's voice clearly and vice versa.Connectivity: Very easy to connect to your smartphone but you may need to troubleshoot it (mentioned in mannuel) for pairing it with your laptop.Unique part of this product : Extremely flexible and lightweighted.I bought this product for Rs.850 but within 2days the price dropped to Rs.800"
1,Seriously I never seen such worst product even street side product are far better.1. First one I got defective unable to connect to call only songs were audible2.Replaced product battery issue 70% battery drained immediately in 10 minutes time3. U can hear opposite side person voice but they can hear only what they spoke
3,"I'm on a spree for best budget wireless earphones.Looking at all the positive product reviews, i was tempted to go for this one. I agree may be on few points but the main important thing about earphones is that it should sound well in layman terms.the sound feels like someone screaming from an old empty well. you hear them but hardly. if Bass, treble are foreign terminology for you then go for it. You may need to pay attention for the lyrics most of the time."
2,"Based on so many positive reviews, I chose to buy it and initially I too liked the earbuds, but just in two days it went off during a call even though it had 60% battery. I tried to start it but on vain. Later I tried to charge and itscharging socket seemed to have loose connection and it did not start charging. Finally, I had to return it.Other observations:1. Build quality is poor.2. Though description here had mentioned as Bluetooth 5.0 but product box had no mention of the same."
5,"I am a prime customer of Amazon and I always purchase a product after so much research bought these Tron in the sale in and trust me I am blown away by these I have used sony and other headphones in the price range of 5 & 6k but this is just similar to them in this price range ""sound quality"" 10/10 ""battery life"" seems good not tested for as described but will update soon ""durability"" 10/10 perfect fit no pain no discomfort.... Really boat has done a fantastic job with amazing music quality with superb bass in all highs mids &lows ..... Just go for it."
2,"This earphone is the best , and awsome at this price range .This was my thinking before purchasing. But when I purchase this i recieved this in well packed manner. I think this is the best one but when I open It and start testing i found that there is very low vocals hearing and music is too high . The contrast of vocals and music not well , it has difference of land and sky. Build quality is good but the overall sound quality is bad only 2 ratings for sound out of 5."
1,"It is no longer working. How can something stop working in 10 days.  Seriously dont go for it.  Also the emails sent to the customer care is not getting replied. The phone number printed on box uses IVR and it says to submit request on link sent via sms.  No such link arrives..Pure case of selling inferiorproduct with no customer service or honouring of warrantyUpdate.. after writing a mail 10 days ago, i am still waiting for reply to claim my warranty..."
4,So awesome for working out! These stay put my ears while I am sweating on the treadmill. And they are very sound proof. They have many different sizes of the ear pieces so I had one that fit perfectly into my ear.
1,"Took a long time to charge for the first time, lost charge within an hour.It stopped charging within one week - had to send it to the bin."
4,I recently purchased these neckband for my father and it turned out really amazing.Sound quality is Good .Noise Cancellation is perfectly fine.They are light weight and battery backup is  long.It is worth the price product.It makes his job so easy all day.
4,"Dear Friends,I am using this earphone more than 10 days.1. Build Quality is average but compare to this price range ok.2. Call quality and range is 5 out of 53. Bass is low so not suit for bass lovers.4. In packing not mentioned Bluetooth versions.5. Battery charge is good. Up to 4 hrs.Even i have searched many earphones and before this i bought wecool moon walk tws  at 799 based on reviews but music is good but call is worst so that returned and bought this Ptron good product with this price range.Thanks to Amazon."
5,Battery backup is too good
1,"Initially Mic was working pretty fine, after week my voice is too low for the opposite user.Very disappointed. now not able to return as well since the return window is closed just after that the issue started."
5,"This neckband is soo nice, color combination also good,  this price segment is soo better,sound quality is amazing, good battery backup Amazon delivery is soo fast, thanks Amazon"
4,"The earphones look good with a smooth design and finish. However, they're a little delicate where the wires exit from the neckband, one feels if pulled roughly might break them. The buttons in this one (unlike ptron's Tangent Bass Plus design which are raised )are in line with the surface so, it can be hard to get the right button sometimes but that's a personal preference. The bass is quite flat and the treble is a little too high pitched for my liking. So, if you're listening to speech for ex you may find the audio a little sharp but music is fine. The battery is good. The max I've got is 8hrs from it with non-continuous usage. Overall a good buy."
5,"I ordered it just Yesterday, I was finding Some cool neckband with gud quality of audio and sound quality also, some period of Warrenty.I found this brand and also my friend said me to go for this bcoz. Of value for money and Style. I would recommend this earphone bluetooth techno. To use instead of other valuable Neckband this is also comes with Bluetooth 5.0"

1,The only problem I have with this headset is that it doest works while charging.It should be must to work while charging as we have 1.5hr charging time and gives 3-4 backup.
5,product is very good and very flexible the ptron neckband has a very good quality of sound battery backup is very good one time charge and 7-8 hours working easily. Really very good one in reasonable price.. I personally love it a lot totally worth it. Sound quality is also very good
5,"Yes it's sound quality is very good it has noise cancellation which is good to enjoy music, I liked this neck band ,price is also decent."
5,Good quality premium neckband.Superior quality.Sound is seriously awesome at this price range. It even has noise cancellation. And bass quality is also good.Overall good product.Dont think just go for it .You will seriously like it alot
5,"The sound quality of this neckband is perfect.  that it's battery backup which was 7-8 hours on watching series and just requires 1-2 hours of charging.The Earbuds Fit Snugly in Ears and They're Magnetic. There's Some Extra Pair of Eartips in The Box to Choose From.The Bass is great. The design of the earbuds are also great. They don't fall out that often while running.The in line microphone is surprisingly very very clear and the person hearing u will not face any issue,if the mic is at a distance from u also it catches your voice, very good micButtons on the mic are tactile and provides a multifunctional key and volume up down buttons, buttons are very responsive and noise cancellation is good also."
5,Sound quality is excellent I'm very happy this is the best neckband with deep base .Worth money.
5,One of the best in category neckband.Sound and build quality is awesome and battery backup can last upto 2 days.If you are thinking of buying a budget friendly neckband with amazing quality than go for it.
5,I like the product It has good sound quality and bass tooI have used this product for 3 days and by using I get to know that It has good battery back up .The buds are affordable and it is best at this price.Not too heavy light weighted product
1,"Please don't buy! Changed 3 star to 1.After 40 day usage:It got faulty, right earbud is not functioning.As I mentioned below it was replaced once by Amazon, so Ptron is refusing to replace it again.Below is the company's response on a complaint raised by me.""Hi,Thank you for contacting pTron!We would like to inform you that only a one-time replacement can be done against the order. kindly refer to the link https://ptron.in/pages/repair-service-warrantyPlease feel free to contact us for further assistance.Regards,Support Team""************************After 2 weeks of usage:Sound quality & Bluetooth connectivity are good,  but... but, Please THINK before BUY! 3star,1) Battery lasts for hardly 8-10 hours.2) Hardly takes 30 minutes to fully charge, that means the battery capacity is not decent.3) Sometime Media audio doesn't play after switching from call, also Voice over the call disconnects, though the device is connected.4) Till 50% it takes 7-8 hours, but the next 50% takes only 1 hour to complete discharge & off the device.5) Frequently comes out of the ear.6)  I'm not able to find this model on PTron website to register it for the warranty. Older versions are available there.  It seams the site itself is not updated with the product details.*** I have tested 2 different devices by replacing the first one.it means the seller has given the wrong information about it's battery life"
5,Nice product...üëçüëç..
4,"It says 8 hrs but since I use this to watch lectures it gives more than 15hrs+ battery life.Sound quality is good, Highs & Lows are perfectly managed but to term these as Bass Heavy would be widely mistake.Overall 4 stars"
4,the base is really good. it a value for this range of money.i really liked it.only the comfort has to be more good.
1,"This product was had manufacturing defect inside the plastic band material,from which it is now broken out, that could not be visible during product receiving time period. Please do something for this automatic damaging, I wanted number of time to connect with customer care service but no any my call receiving by customer service. Please do the satisfactory advice to repair or exchange purpose because this product is under guarantee period. I was received this order on 14 May 2020."
2,"Edit: After 1 year of usage.The headphone starts developing cracks in the overhead plastic band, the padding on the earcups and head band started coming off. The boat logo has completely vanished (all this happened even after taking utmost care). The sound is still fine.Please be aware of the cheap plastic and poor built quality of the headphone. Instead of this you can buy Blaupunkt BH01 Eqz headphones which are the best at this price.PS. The gold plating on the AUX cable will come off creating much disturbance while connecting and listening to music rendering it useless.EDIT: The sound cut-offs are annoying during watching films or playing. You can't hear some dialogues at low volume.Honest review after 46 days of usage...PROS:‚Ä¢ Good sound quality, vocals are crystal clear. Nice to see AUX cable bundled in the box itself.‚Ä¢ You can get rich bass in Bluetooth and above average bass using the wired connection.‚Ä¢ The ear cups are padded with good quality foam and faux leather, no pain on continuous use (Used it for 2-2.5 hours and was still very comfortable).‚Ä¢ Value for money, Got it for 1099/- only.‚Ä¢ Not Bass heavy but you can tweak settings to get good bass.‚Ä¢ Good fit and design.‚Ä¢ Good Battery backup, got 7 hrs+ on single charge. Full charge takes about 2-3 hours, the orange LED goes off when fully charged.‚Ä¢ Build quality is good considering the price of the product.‚Ä¢ Call quality is average (the speaker is not so loud). The headphone also tells the Caller‚Äôs Number during an incoming call.‚Ä¢ The Latency is also acceptable at this price point.CONS:‚Ä¢ On Bluetooth, when the volume is kept very low and the music has a very low pitch, sometimes the left-right speakers turn ON and OFF automatically. (It can be eliminated by keeping volume bar at about 50%, also no problem when connected using Aux cable). I saw this problem in boAt Rockerz 450 as well.‚Ä¢ When kept at 100% volume the sound tends to get distorted. (Its THD-Total Harmonic Distortion is ‚â§5%, whereas most good headphones have it at ‚â§1%)‚Ä¢ The aux cable seems to be too thin so be careful while handling it.‚Ä¢ The earcups are not sweat resistant so take care of it."
5,Sound is very crystal clearBass is very pretty and goodValue for money
1,Bass is disgusting... Range is good but when I tried PUBG it keeps disconnecting continuously...Useless headphone...I returned it on the same day I received.
4,"Marvelous performanceIf you watch movies or series in Netflix,amazon or Hotstar this head set is perfect option Crysta clear sound may be not deep bass but you feel like theatre effect with perfect clear sound just go for it ....."
1,I have used it for 1 month after then the headphone literally breaked. Please My Dear friends a slight little push can break it. Headphone quality Is Cheap. Not for gamers. Dont Buy It
4,"Headphones are great but recieved the already used by someone headphones. Seal was broken and was reattached. Scratches were visible along side the earcups. Also when i watch something on Netflix, either the right side or the left one randomly keeps disconnecting and reconnecting Returned the product."
1,"I have been a huge fan of BoaT and have been purchasing headphones and wireless-only from them since it is an indian company.But, i was let down on the above product. Within one month the thing is broken. The sad part is that, when I uploaded the invoice which was downloaded from Amazon itself, the company BoaT has send a message to me stating the invoice is not theirs. So weird!!!So, when it comes to faulty products they have funny excuses to say NO."
4,Nice
1,"Didn't last for a month... It just broke .. as you can see. As one moth is over Amazon won't take it back. Whome to blame here Amazon or boat company!!If you still want to purchase..... Then go for jbl and sony products. Atleast they'll last much longer than than this pathetic product. You may spend 500-1000 extra money, but it worth it"
5,"Well I am writing this review after 6 months of daily usage. If you are looking for a headphone in mid range budget with awesome sound quality with a perfect bass then go for this.After my 6 months usage, I am totally satisfied with this product. The battery backup wonders me. After a full charge, if you use it 5-6 hours per day then it will last for about 4-5 days.The sound quality is also of high definition. Bass is also wonderful. Connectivity range is also good not very good. Just one thing with what I would like to say it Ok is its microphone . Microphone works well in noise cancelling but range of mic is some less.Overall you can purchase this product without any worries. I hope that you also will like it.I am regretting one thing also that is I had ordered black colour which I am not liking much as compared to other two colours"
5,Boat Rockers 310 is perhaps the best sounding product below Rs 1200. It's treble bass and volume up down functions are very good. The curved bar is soft and padded covered by leather. Once charged it can be used for 5 to 6 hours in Bluetooth connectivity mode. Aux cable and micro usb cable is provided as asseccory in packing box. A good choice to buy.
1,Plz don't buy this product.. after using half an hour your ears will start paining. Instead on ads they should work on quality of products.it broke after usage of one month.totally wastage of money.
1,"Poor Basic Headphones. Highly Overpriced. Sound is normal, no special bass or noise cancellation. Build and look very cheap and basic. Buttons not strudy. Unnecessarily Big. Does not look durable. Initial reaction - Very Bad. Amazon do not return Electronics if unsatisifed, only option to replace. No use as did not like the product itself."
4,I would like to start with pro sound is good and battery life also goodNow the con's you can't use it on summer because it will heat up you're ear and you can't use it for long time because it will hurt ear overall I can say it's a good product but I can't use it on summer it's hurting my ear
1,My ears and head stared paining. It's uncomfortable and the bass is also not good. The sound also bursts.
1,"No Voice cancellation in this product, for this cost, this is not worth product, Boat company is good in headset, but manufacturing such products will loose its brand image in the market"
1,"Product broke after 3 months of usage.not happy.i have claimed for a return and am waiting for a response from boat team.though when I called the customer service and said that the issue with my complaint is that one of the bands is broken,they said they cannot help me as it is physical damage.guys I did not have a problem with the audio but it did break very soon.i don‚Äôt think I am going to get a return on this product so I suggest you to go for a different product"
5,Super mind blowing
5,"After reading these reviews where some people really didn't like it and where some people loved it, I got really skeptical. I probably was about to cancel my order. But I got it anyways and It's so good. It fits my ears perfectly, it doesn't pain even after hours of usage. The sound is more than loud enough with enough bass and also has this really good theater effect. Kinda makes me look like a gamer girl not gonna lie lmao. But, anyways. So far my experience has been good. And yes it might be a little delicate but which headphones are not??? Just buy it guys don't fall for the bad reviews this headset is beautiful!!!"
2,"This product has poor built quality there is no voice cancellation at first when I ordered it it was pretty well but it started giving me problems after few weeks it had problem in connectiveti with Bluetooth and in some calls it would automatically ends the call . It not at all good for gameing . It has a very poor noise cancellation fataliti . After few weeks it just broke by stretching when I was wereing it for use poor quality if you are buying it is only good for less use or it will start creating problem it has an average sound quality.it is not good for meeting ,classes, gameing  very bad quality recommended not to buy this product is very bad no noise cancellation facility very bad build quality so you should not buy this product .very bad product this by stretching it breaks so build quality is very bad it does not  has an noise cancellation facility and this auxillary works not very well so I recommend not to buy this product"
4,Sound quality is no doubt a good point becoz of Boats company but i feel its Bluetooth connectivity is little bit pathetic sometimes it does connect with anybody else's phone and just make sure tht u have Ur phone very near 2 u otherwise there's a glitch which I heard from Google is dangerous due to the rays and I'll recommend u too charge even at 90 % battery becoz glitch starts to occur otherwise and yess it doesn't fall while exercising so that's a good point 2 me. Overall since 2 months usage it's been good and I keep it in its box only after usage and I got at a reasonable price so it's grrt fr me !
2,The headphones are kinda good in terms of the audio quality and battery backup.......but the build and the quality of the headphones is not that great as the ones which I ordered broke like shown in the photo and this happened very close to the time I actually ordered it and started using it........I used the headphones as I would have used any other headphones but the headphones just came apartü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
4,"For the price of 1100 with bluetooth 5, its a 4 star product. Some flaws are there too. Made of plastic, so will easily degrade/break. The funtion keys only work on bluetooth mode not with AUX cable. Ear cushion not too great, after long hours it may cause pain in ears."
5,"Its very cool, stylish, and high quality hd bass...just superb"
2,Bought it almost 4 months ago.Works fine while using it with the aux cable. But while in bt mode the music kinda fluctuates in low volumes.( Either left or right cut off or both of them cut offs)Had it increase volume so that the music starts Playing again.Not so happy with how it sits on my head.Might look good but ergonomics are poor.The build is alos not that satisfying.Already had many hairline cracks.
5,"I bought this to attend online classes of my college the battery life is very awesome i charge it once for 4-5 hours and it keeps working for more than a week, the quality of sound is nice but long hours of listening causes pain in ears which almost every headphones do,other than that best headphones, i purchased these at 999 in Amazon sale so at a big profit. Thanks for reading."
3,"Sound is all good and good hearing over bluetooth too, when connected to mobile / laptop. But 2 major issues I experienced:1. Cannot use bluetooth for making calls, attending meeting where I need to speak. The receiver is not able to hear my voice even though I kept the volume to maximum. So I am forced to use a wired connection for the mic to pickup my voice and make it audible to the other side.2. The build quality - Bought this in April 2021. The headset broke 10 days back, making it unusable. This is the first time a product like headset is broke [see photo] within 6 months of usage. I could have used it for not more than 200 hours at the maximum. Don't know if this is covered in the 1 year warranty that Boat has promised. Now I bought another headset of another brand. Actually disappointed with Boat over these issues."

3,"Pros1) Good Sound Quality with decent Bass2) Decent noice cancellation due to Tight earcussions.3) Great Aesthetics and Light WeightCons1) Sometimes there is no sound in one of the earcups2) They are not comfortable even for short period use. I ordered it specifically for online meetings but  they are uncomfortable and causes pain over ears in just 30 minutes. So forget long usage. Company claims these are""Ergonomically designed"". No they are not. It is designed such that if you increase headband size, they become more tight. There's no point of good sound quality if you can't wear them.Conclusion: Don't buy these if you looking for comfortable headphones. Buy these headphones only for their design. You can get same sound quality in other headphones for same price."
3,"I am using this headphone from last 2 days, here's my experience -1. I got this one for 13992. Battery capacity is really good, 10+ hrs3. Sound quality is good4. Bluetooth connectivity is good5. The biggest problem is its ear cushions, they're really tight , you can't wear it continuously even for an hour"
1,"Don‚Äôt purchase any boat headphone from Amazon, that was duplicate product,there is number started with R printed on head band ,not present in this product..Side determination as L/R not mentioned over metallic bar over head band,no boat logo printed over apex of head band,lastly poor quality sound and bass,quality of cushion over ear cups was of cheap material.After returning that I purchased same model from Myntra,where all points I mentioned satisfied me‚Ä¶DONT PURCHASE ANY BOAT PRODUCT FROM AMAZON"
1,"I can't believe the experience I've had with these headphones, when they arrived, I was unable to activate the warranty for it even after following all the steps mentioned in the package. Just after 20 days one side stopped working but it would suddenly start and stop working from time to time. I tried calling a service station but no one would pick up and provide me with any assistance, after a month and a half, one side has completely stopped working and now these headphones are just a waste, I wrote them a mail as well to help me with this issue and got no response. Don't buy this product it's not durable at all and has basically no after-sales support."
1,"Was working fine for the 1st week. Started to hear a crackling disturbance all the time, in around 2 weeks after buying it. Sadly, the return window had been closed by then. Now stuck with this useless e-waste. Fitting is very tight and uncomfortable. Of all the Bluetooth headsets I have used, this is the most uncomfortable and pathetic product. Go for something else even if they give it for free. As long as it was working fine, sound quality was good with proper noise cancelation."
1,BOUGHT ON 29 MAY 2020. RECEIVED FROM AMAZON ON 1 JUNE 2020. MIC STOPPED WORKING ON 15 JUNE 2020.CUSTOMER CARE NUMBER ARE NOT WORKING. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. CALL ME FOR A FEEDBACK SUMEET 98101-98127
3,Bass n sound quality is good. But while making calls other end can't hear me properly. Another issue is that ear start to pain after some time. Also built quality n material quality is very low don't look like a big brand product in real. Low quality plastic.
4,"This headphone is good for non-bass lovers. Like, if you don't listen to deep bass music, this headphone is good. Infact great..Rate:-Sound quality- 9.5/10Bass- 7.5/10Build quality:- 8/10Sound clearity:- 9/10Mic:- 4/10Total:- 38/50If you're buying for studies like me, then it is good option......"
3,Evarything is Good but when we use 1¬Ω hrs above too much of pain occured on ears
5,Sound quality awesome bro without noise...charging also......peaks...
5,Awesome headphone in good price. I love sound quality of this so if you are looking for budget Wireless Bluetooth Headphone then this is great choice..
5,If you all are looking for a new and best headphones then go for this blindly.. you will comfortable.. this headphone is absolutely perfect for music lovers . It also gives the best gaming experience ever.if red color us available you can go for it because it is very attractive. And if not available take the orange or grey one. Same product but green and black will not make you look attractive. This is not deep bass but this is punchy bass. And yes you will not get an auxiliary cable.It connects only in one or two seconds only. So Do Not WATCH ANY OTHER HEADPHONES AND GO FOR THIS ONE ONLY..if any doubt ask me. I will definitely reply.
3,"Bads :1. Bass not at all there.2. Cushions too hard, in 10-15 minutes ear pain starts.3. Buttons clicks like toys and feels like any moment may fall down.4. Aux cable is not box content.5. Dual pairing between PC and Mobile I found very pathetic. Headset confuse when to stay connected with which device. I was on WebEx meeting on PC, when phone rang instead of just notification it literally disconnected from PC and prioritised phone.6. When mic receives same continuous sound like 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' it breaks otherwise works fine. Now could not review how it handles surrounding noise so no comment on noise cancellation of mic.Goods1. Fair build at a give cost.2. Does not look impressive neither bad.3. Mic is loud enough. Tried on different phones, apps, computers, tablets, mobile operators for calls. Results is just same.4. Voice listening quality is average. Not bad at all.Final words :1. Good for calling in short time and roaming around phone at short distances.2. Bad buy if looking for music listening."
5,This one is FREAKING AMAZING...  BoAt Rockerz bhi iske saamne nahi tikega.  Just go for it
5,"Product is very nice.Price is great,Sound quality good,Noise cancellation also good.Battery backup is excellent.I got the product before time, on 30 Jan. When I switched it on, it had 80 % of battery. I used it thoroughly and battery came to 20 % on 7 Feb. And then I charged it.It's a great product in great price.üëçüëçüëç"
5,Not expected from this product. Bought it to do work from home as office laptop had bluetooth. However started using it for listing to songs. Battery backup A1 sound quality A1 bass effect A1 (tested on EMUI sound and music equaliser) drawback is the mic. On call it really not that good
5,"Packing was good.Sound quality 100/100Looks 100/100Fabric material is niceNoise reduction is perfectTreble is equalised.I did few video calls, using this headphones and people are gone crazy.Asked me for links.Beat part of this headphones is the outer area which is designed in net form, which makes it look more coooolllü§òüèªBy far best headphones in this price."
5,Every thing was fine only the issue was that package was not well in conditions but ok in this range I can perfer anyone to purchase this as there should be one more thing added with it eg aux cable which is not been given.
4,"The headphone looks good, the feel of it is just about average (good for the price I paid). Sound too is good at this price range. Given its moderately long-lasting battery backup, one would consider buying it for long usage, say, to watch an entire movie if not an entire web-series. But, it fits tighter than other headphones and the tightness cannot be ignored because the ears start paining.  I thought the headphone will loosen up its tightness after a few usages, but no, I am writing this after using it for 12 days and it still hurts the same. (Except for the pain that it gives, it deserves a 5-star rating for its price range)."
5,"Love the colour and the design. A little tight, but it's okay."
5,this review is after long term useageat this price range this headphone is awesome good sound quality with long term battery life at a 50% volume this headphone working upto 24hr.bass is also awesome
5,"I like the product. Though it get a little tight around one's ears and cannot be worn for long hours, it solves the need at an affordable price."

5,So good...nice build quality.once again zebronics prooved itself as good one...thanks Amazon for getting me this nice product at 800 rupees.
4,"It's a pretty good product. I am actually writing this review after using this for about 10 months now. The sound is good and battery life is also amazing. The bluetooth range is also amazing. Now coming to the cons what i want everyone to consider is that it's not very comfortable. The ear cups are small and so my ears starts to pain after some time. Now this is subjective of your ear size. Using continuously for 2 hrs will be very painful. Regarding the leathery materia, it's pretty comfortable and good, but last week the skins started to peel off slowly. It's not a very big problem as we have padded cotton underneath but for some it might be something to consider."
5,"Great product , value for money . Best headphones under 1000 rs . Awesome bass quality with high sounds . Long lasting battery.Also fast delivery. It is value for money product.Buy this headphones without any doubt.üòçüòçüòçü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü§©ü§©ü§©"

5,Good Product and sound quality is bestwhen I ordered zeb-bang headphone thats battery is immediately discharging. But Amazon Replaced this headphone. now zeb-bang headphone is good working . thank you amazon thank you seller.
4,"Just OK.....not as good as expected, but can't complain much.you get one notification and the meeting sound goes off (maybe because I used it with my phone and laptop both together)For listening music, it's not bad..........not high on bass, but okay considering its price........ don't have high expectations.Wish I could return it and order some other headphones insteadEdit:When I received the product, it might have had a faulty mic, I ordered a replacement, took some calls with the new one, and it's meeting basic expectations (you cannot expect bose/jabra like noise cancellation but it's not bad).Overall sound quality is also not bad but don't expect high bass.For 800 rs, it's  a good deal."
5,Awesome sound quality and it's is the best headphone under Rs700. Value for money product.
5,"Powerful product is the excellent performance. I love it nowExcellent Battery Performance:Built-in rechargeable Lithium-poly battery,3.5 hours music playing time"
5,Thankful to amazon selling this product maono it looks like I finally have a new Headphones. Today I wore my new headphones for 3 hours straight. I was very happy to find that I didn‚Äôt suffer from Ear Fatigue that I have experienced with other headphones. Yes they are comfortable.These Headphones are LOUD (I love it). I was surprised to find that I enjoyed a very distinctive STEREO EFFECT of sounds in an out from different ears and it sounded great! Love the way the BASS jumps in to make these headphones a great listening experience.
1,"I bought this headphone by looking at many 5 star reviews - but was totally disappointed. There is no option to return - they will replace with exactly the same item. The headphone is meant for small kids - definitely not for adults - The gap is too narrow and presses against my ears. Very uncomfortable, cannot wear for more than a few seconds. It also does not cover my ears fully. In summary - I have wasted my money on this 400 gram trash which cannot be returned. Very disappointed."
5,This are mind blowing studio monitoring headphones.Headphones are extremely comfortableEarcups and headbands are super softEarcups are big and covers entire earsDrivers size is big 50mmSound quality is excellent for priceCable is rugged and coiledJacks are gold platedHeadphones are collapsible and swivelingThis are favourite studio monitoring headphones. Most importantly this are much more cheaper than many other well known companies. I just love this headphones. I'm using them regularly.
3,"The sound quality is mediocre. It hisses at higher volumes when connected to audio interface.  It also doesn‚Äôt appear to be flat frequency response like any monitor headphones should. The highs are quite harsh and the lows are not tight. But for the price, I guess that‚Äôs expected.The build is good."
5,"The headphone are awsome. I am using audiotechnica M50x and maono both. i can feel the detailing is better compare to M50x the highs, mids, lows are neutral perfect for music production and yead you can mastering sound with this but not like beyerdynamic headphone but in this price maan take it. I just the problem with this is only the wire like telephone wire the wire is strong but when i attach to my audiointerface was fallen because of the wire. The build looks like some 10000 headphone mateblack and glossy red look awsome. And its 32 ohma so you can connect to you 3.5mm jack to and you will get the 6.35 jack also. Im fully satisfied with this.‚ù§"
5,"Sound quality is osm...1- very light weight2-comfertable in ears3-noise cancelation is quite good4- perfect for studio or blog makers5-it looks very cool in head6-design is quite good7-The affordable pricing, top notch quality in build and audio quality makes this totally worthy in my perspective.  I would recommend every music lover to grab this wonderful headphones.8-i can feel the bass....nd this gives a different feel ..it increases the level of excitement you are doing....if watching a movie or playing music amy thing....Overall in this amount the product is best...."
4,"1. An American product ‚Äì ‚ÄúMaono Technology Inc, Texas, USA‚Äù in Amazon India Thanks a lot!Have been using it for about a week, I have used, PHILLIPS and BOAT headphones earlier.I am an Amateur and recently started to record music. This is a great product, when compared to my other head phones.2. This one has a sturdy build and light weight compared to other 50 mm headphones.3. Amazing 50mm driver for superior thumping bass, this one has the capability to deliver pure clear bass along the sides of mid and high notes with high resolution4. Foldable and Stretchable headband to fit your head and 180 degree5. Has 3.5 mm and 6mm jack compatibility.6. You can share the music with other users with the provided 3.5 mm port. It is highly compatible and has a multi-purpose: 3.5mm jack7. The package includes a detachable 3m-long coiled cord with 3.5mm plug and (extra 2) 6.3mm adapter Gold coated plugs and easy to share and scores to one jack and instrument o/p to other.8. Padding / Cushion is the best and comfortable.9. Reproduces all frequencies with equal intensity.10. Valuable for the money.11. It's like a Subwoofer on your ears.BLINDLY GO FOR IT - IF YOU LOOKING FOR BUDGET STUDIO HEADPHONES"
5,"This Product is a Kick ass under such a good budget. My friends recommended me to go for the Sennheiser, but i had a gut feeling about this one and it turned out to be a Good choice. The noise cancellation is decent, The drivers are good. if you are looking for a pumpy Bass don't go for this. this is a dedicated Studio Headphone so the Bass is Neat and not deep. people working on Ableton, Logic Pro, FL Studio, etc can go for this. Thumbs Up Maono team. good work."
5,"I am loving these headphones. They are of good quality and has a heavy built. Good thing to note is that despite it being a lil heavy, when you put it on, it's somehow lightweight, probably due to the foams and all.Just received this product today, will update if I face any challenges. The only thing I disliked was the packaging. They should come in some thermocol or in bubble wrap as to avoid any damage during the transport from the buyer to seller. Rest is all good.AFTER 2.5 Months:After using it for more than 2.5 months, my ears hurt and pain after using it for more than 30 mins so make sure you use it on low volume only otherwise your ear will Rest in Peace. That is my only suggestion after continued usage of 2.5 months."
5,"I'm using it for my gaming pc and work pc it is amazing product with perfect built.Quality is good, sound is good, good packaging, Matt finish lookOverall best one"
5,"I'm a music producer and bought these headphones as secondary headphones to complement my DT770 Pros. These obviously don't sound as sweet or detailed as the 770s but that's why they are good. These headphones have a more ""honky"" sound which isn't that good for listening to music, but is great for producing music. Cuz if you can make stuff sound good on these, they'll translate well everywhere. They're an absolute steal for the price and the only problem I have with them is that they're not very comfortable to wear for long periods. Otherwise, great job on these Maono."
5,"I bought the Maona headphones loaded with so many good qualities.. I am very satisfied with this one. It's very comfortable to wear and by design it looks good aswell. This is a foldable headphone and has got pretty long wire, 3.5mm and 6.35 plug included. Especially designed for studio tracking & mixing which is another asset for DJ's. Last but not least the sound quality which is very clear, suitable for listening music and you will fall in love with this headphone.Lastly, I want to suggest others to give it a try atleast and you wouldn't disappoint."
4,"FIRST OF ALLL I WOULD LIKE TO THANK AMAZON FOR PROVIDING ME NICE AND CRISP HEADPHONES.Let me start with one important message when i received the pack it was opened from the box which i didnt usually see in amazon delivery ITS WIEREDDDDDD??????????.

4,The sound quality is crystal clear. But if u r lukng for powerful bass than these will surely disappoint u. Evn boat 900 has far more bass than these. Good product but Not suitable for bass lovers.
3,"Got the headphone today with both the cable missing, have put on replacement . Listened for 2 hours using a short aux cable in smartphone (mi max 2)  and  man! The bass... Being a studio headphone having that kind of bass is pretty awesome.. Vocal is good but instruments are okish...It's pretty heavy, plastic quality is good but has some clicky sound(when gets little pressure you can feel the plastic over the magnet gives clicky sound ; may be the one i got has it bcoz it feels used and also i said earlier all cables are missing)... Covers my ears totally but bcoz of the weight can't be used for long. The seller or the person who ordered it ate those cables...maono is a good company but the seller may not be that good.. Overall good headphone if you get it in good condition.. I can give the headphone 5 star for its sound quality and price to performance ratio it offers"
1,"Only the Elephant has bigger ear than mine üòÇ yet these headphones get mine covered and don't expect 15k sound quality in 2k but under 5k these headphones are the best yet I doubt the build quality and the company. Let's see how long it lasts. Edit--3 Dec.2020 As I expected build quality is Not good so if you can buy a decent studio headphones, avoid this product. But if you want to use it for 2-3 months only, it may last that long.Thanks."
5,"So i am into mixing and mastering of music and been using this for a while . I bought them for 1800‚Çπ around and Here's my review considering this price .Build Quality - It has got really premium build quality , i can call the build quality as the highlight of this product . i just love the matte blak thing when it comes to looks and it even feels wayy premium . The folding & fitting adjustments , also portablity factor is actually helpful . The earmufs are quite soft and  the comfort of these headphones ain't a compalint for my ears. Cable Has got sufficient length and no issue regarding duarblity .Comaptiblity - It works easily with my pc and smartphone using its 3.5mm jack and can easily work with amplifiers and other devices .Sound Quality - So yeah , These headphones are made for the range of mixing and mastering which requires very accurate and balanced sound output . After trying to mix couple of my tracks and listening to general music on these , i can say that the sound output needs more balance . The treble is much on the heavier side and so are the mids where as the lows are somewhat getting supressed although the bass is quite punchy , The audio clarity is overall quite good but it can be balanced and then it'll sound much better mainly for the purpose of mixing and mastering .What i Liked:- Premium Build- Comfortable- Collapsible& Portable- Audio Clarity"
5,"This is for the 1st time I have purchased any monitor headphones,I was planning to buy one from very long time.Here are my experiences that I would like to share.‚ñ™Ô∏éSound is so dynamic with punching bass along with 50mm big driver.‚ñ™Ô∏éComfort is good, because size of ear cushions are large & it covers the full ear.‚ñ™Ô∏éThe headphone is quite heavier than the Normal headset but overall light weight because it's a DJ headphones and comes with 118inch long extending cable .‚ñ™Ô∏éNoise cancellation is literally laudable, you dont have to deal with the outer world.‚ñ™Ô∏éFoldable design makes easy to carry it anywhere.Although I bought this one for mixing background sound of my YouTube videos and I find them useful, it offers precise background sound.Apart from this, I Also tried them for listening music and it was a nice experience, and I appreciate the headphones sharing feature.So overall I liked it, and can consider it as a value for money deal."
4,"The headphones are very good for aspiring studio producers and gamers. And for the price, it's the best pick.- Sound Quality is great, it's crystal clear and it has good enough stereo quality. The frequency separation is not top-notch but still, it's better than the other headphones that I've used at this price range.- Looks premium, build quality is great.- The ear cups are big and have good cushioning so it's comfortable. Though, it is quite bulky and heavy which might cause problems if you are using these for a long time run.- It has a detachable, 2 in 1 convertible cable which is very useful.- Flexible design makes it more handy and can be used for one ear mixing.I would recommend these headphones for studio use and gaming. It's a value for money deal.Great product, go for it.Thank You!"
3,"Well this Headphone from maono is amazing for it's price but it isn't for music monitering or mixing and the problem is that the headphones has saturated lows (Bass, 808,and all) and also saturated mids and the highs of the music feels really less but I gonna use it as a alternative Headphone which artist can use to record songs but not to mix and master or to monitor and yes this Headphone is really comfortable like too soft and I really love it and this headphone is for normal people' who enjoy Music or to the people who do podcast and stuff but don't buy it to mix and master , close your eyes and go for audio technica series' of headphone you might have to pay lil extra but it is worth it but tbh maono did a amazing job for it's price can't complain G."
5,"I have used this headset for half a year without any problems, and I have been using this headset. This is a very professional monitor headset, very worth the price. I bought him for only 2999 rupees. I am a youtube music worker, so I really need a headset with more realistic sound quality, and this headset directly hits the heart and gave me the most suitable experience.There are two things I like most:1. This earphone is a monitor earphone, without so many fancy functions, but its biggest feature is to bring me the most authentic sound feedback. As I said, I am a musician, and I especially need this. And, because of the extra large and later earmuffs, I can concentrate on recording and editing music sounds without any noise from the outside world.2. Furthermore, we often record music for a long time, so I will wear it for 4-5 hours. I have tried a lot of headphones, like oneaudio.AKG, but, more or less there will be some pain or discomfort. But this headset is completely absent. The earmuffs are so soft that I would squeeze it."
5,"This is one of the best studio headsets I have come across. I am a filmmaker so it's perfect for editing. Sound quality due to noise cancellation is superb. It has a 3m long wire with 50mm speaker. It is perfect for Djaying, editing, recording songs or even podcast. It has 2 3mm long plugs. So you can use smaller inbuilt plug or the longer plug as per your convenience. I am in love with this product. Its durable & made with good quality material. Great product for an amazing price."
5,"1) It's comfortable Extremely. As it's over the ear, it cover your ears. The cushions and the material used for the ear pads are excellent. The head band has cushioning too which is appreciated.2) The sound quality is really good. Whether you are watching YouTube videos or movies online, the words are clearly audible and enunciated. You won't miss a single sound with these headphones.3) Amazing thumping bass, use any equalizer software to optimise, but this one has the capability to deliver pure clear bass along the sides of mid and high nodes.4) Comes with 2 quality Jacks, one of which is the normal 3.5 mm - 3.5mm and other which has a 3.5 mm - 6. 3mm jack on the other end which can be used to plug into electrical instruments.5) comfortable use for hours. No sweating, no uneasiness.6) Very very valuable for the money you pay."
5,"Hi, the prdouct was very good..sound quality is awesome. Their service was phenomenal. For me, unfortunately,  one of the ear cups broke from the main frame. Although by their policy they wouldn't replace items which got damaged due to man made issues, in this case, given the need for this gadget for schooling from home, and the extraordinary circumstances due to the pandemic not permitting replacement, they were very empathetic and  processed a refund for me in very quick time with constant update on progress, thereby winning my trust and enabling me to buy a new Maono headset. Hat's off to the company's customer service. Wonderful. Thankyou so much."
5,Gud quality headphones with crystal clear sound and .... We get 3.5mm which we can use for mobile and also a adapter to connect with the amplifier .... The design and looks was very cool .... I like it very much
4,"Awesome sound stage, but you might need a dac amp or a USB interface with a phones out to use it to its full potential. Lil heavier on bass, but nice for mixing on the go. Only cons would be - the included cable could've been a bit longer, and the head band could've had more foam, as in its current state, wearing long term can give slight head aches (true for me at least). The body is majority soft touch plastic, but not the cheap kind."
5,"The maono AU-MH601 headphones are good for mixed usage. Be it studio or enjoying them at home, they work well. Noise cancellation is really good and Can be used for Hours without any pain on ears. 50 mm driver unit gives higher output with better delivery than the available ones in market!!Best part can be used with both 3.5 and 6.35mm Jacks. Its foldable, hence don‚Äôt take in much space and can be put for travelling as well. It has good sound insulation and noise cancellation ability. Literally, can‚Äôt hear any outside noise if volume is kept above 80% plus audio output doesn‚Äôt break or fragment.Really liked them!! Worth a shot!!"
3,I bought these headphones for 2200 rupees and in under 3 months the screws started to become loose and in 11 months it broke down. Now one side of the headphones don't even work. Better to go for headphones that do not rotate as it will last you long.SOUND QUALITY: The sound is good for the price. It sounds a little bit bright. The stereo separation is good.The headphones are not comfortable at all to wear.Also these can get very loud without distortion. But it distorts in the mid lows if you push it too high.
5,"Maono, you saved me atleast 2000 more rupees.. cause I was planning to buy OneOdio or Audio Technika later this year...But this is just awesome...---------If someone found a good , sturdy case for this one, esp. in matching colours, please tell me"
5,I own a recording studio and the headphone is awesome in this price it is better than behringer headphones and it feels similar like Audio Technica m50x and sound is similar to m20x studio monitoring headphones.The frequency is flat and it sounds great. Best for mixing in this price.Truely recommended
4,Looks posh.sound quality not out of the world but very nice.vocals are extremely good.bass is nice. For big head and ears it is not comfortable after 15-20mins of listening.ears start heating and paining for people with big ears.so i wouldn't recommend it for big eared people.
4,"Geniuenly speaking after using them for around 1 year time i can say that everything is good and ok but do not expect anything like super cool the one thing that is the most problematic for me is they do not look so good also of your budget is tight go for earphones they are much better and you may get some good deals at this price range  "" PEACE """
5,The product is amazing 200% value for money. Sound quality is pretty cool. Noise cancelation is also pretty cool.
5,"If you're buying it for Synth or Guitar then this product is best in the range as it provides you with good sound quality and bass.The 6.35 to 3.5 cable is long so it gives you enough room for the movement and all.3.5 aux cable is short but it's good for phone. It also have mic attached to it so call are possible.Now coming to the sound. I have tried connecting it to Marshall MG4 and Vault 15w amp. Sound varies according to the amp for guitars. You can play metal, lead one low sound for better quality and can play Clean or Blues on high volume."
5,Very Comfortable with Awesome quality of audio jack along with awesome noise cancellation .It has also a awesome sound quality alongwith perfect Base and good quality product.
5,"Quality looks Marvelous it gives you a premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced on every type of ears, Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel."
4,Decent product. Sound quality good for regular use and in the price range. Plastic build yet decent looking and sturdy. Good ear cushion. Overall nice product.
5,"Noise cancellation is up to mark could be better , Audio output is durabel not like real stidio headphones and not also over the ear but hey! it's a  blast if you trying first time this headphones has potential. just go for it especially gamers ."
5,Good
5,It's great for recording a song etc. Not tested yet for gaming but I hope it will be good too!
5,Recording
5,Very good headphones for those who play games
5,Fits perfectly. Sound quality is awesome. Clamping force is little bit higher side. Bass and treble balanced.
5,"Received the package today.Very good packaging. We get our headphones inside the Pouch, a 6.3 mm to 3.5 mm aux cable, a 3.5 to 3.5 mm cable with mic and a 50 rupees redeemable gift.Very happy"
5,Amezing sound quality
5,It's good for music Only don't take it for gaming
3,Dislike the mic setting

4,Audio quality is pretty good. Very Comfortable. Light.
5,Amazing value for your money
5,By for casio sound quality really good
4,"Buy 3000 one ,don't  buy 2,500 one"
5,Very nice product
5,Excellent
5,The sound quality is good
4,Cristal clear vocals and decent Bass.
4,"Sound Quality & instrument separation is good as it is a Hi-Res certified Headphone . But you can‚Äôt wear it for long time comfortably & which matters a lot ,, because if you are not comfortable to use then you can‚Äôt enjoy the soundquality properly.And also It doesn‚Äôt look premium.So if you can sacrifice on these things then you can go for this only for Sound Quality"
2,"There is difference between the black and the white variants, you don't get a dedicated mic with white one it will be Just another small. The one which I recieved had a fault. People on the other end of the call can clearly hear what I'm listening in other tab. Audio quality was fine. Returned it within a day."
3,In almost every YouTube review you will see them with detachable mic.While here you have to check for model description even though the model number is same. But accessories are different for lots of them.
5,The build quality is good. The audio quality is good. This product is a true value for money. So my suggestion is go for it with closed eyes.
1,i ordered this headset on october 4 and it was to be delivered on 9 th october got delayed and didn't even given chance to refund  and it was delivered to me as on 17 october and without even getting this product in my hand the return window is shown closed as on 16 th october.Product is not at all comfortable to the ear as shown by youtubers.Audio is ok but not at all comfortable then what is the use ? And the package was awful.And also I was a prime customer. This was my experience from this purchase. Totally disappointed.

1,It has stopped working within warranty period and Amazon does not show option to return or replace it within warranty period.
1,Received second hand headphone
4,"Im going to give a small comparison of this product with two of the headphones i have been using recently.This includes Samsung level u ( rs 2249/) and the ant audio w56 in ear wired earphone ( rs 599/)ProsDecent build qualityExcellent sound qualityApt for watching movies.Soft cushioningMicGood quality cableConsExternal noices creeps in a lot ( less noice cancellation effect).Jack is not gold plated, but I won't complain about it because the gold plating on most of the jacks of headphones in this price range will wear off after a months usage.On comparing the boat bass heads 900 with the ones mentioned above, I noticed that the bass levels were pretty much equal between the ant audio w56 and boat bass heads 900. Samsung level u has the least bass compared to the other 2In terms of audio quality, the boat bass heads and Samsung level u are in the same level, the clarity of sound is a bit less in the ant audio w56 compared to the boat .For outdoor use, I would prefer the ant audio w56 as it has better noice cancellation compared to the boat.ComfortI have read some reviews complaining about the boat bass heads 900 that it pains in the ears after a few minutes of usage. But I have not experienced such problems.Build qualityThe plastics used is not the best, but acceptable. Ear pads are well cushioned.SummaryOverall a really decent product from boat, excellent sound clarity and good bass makes it good for watching movies. Most suitable for indoor usage, good value for money ( bought it for 799 but will be available for 599 at certain times.)Audio quality 4/5Bass 3.8/5Value for money 4/5Comfort 4/5Build quality 3.7/5Thank you for your time."
4,"The Boat bass heads really live up to their name by providing amazing Bass for music lovers.Pros:1. The design is stylish, especially the white one.2. The headphone is easily foldable making it convenient to carry.3. Mic for calls.4. Excellent Bass.5. Very Cheap (Bought for around 900 during sale).6. Durable and lengthy Cable.Cons:1. You cannot wear it for more than one hour, beyond which your ears start hurting due to the tight design.2. Slight distortion at 100% sound levels."
1,"exactly after 30-32 days,mic problem, in-line mic not working, and when connected headphones it automatically mutes all volume by reducing audio levels automatically, tested on different mobile phones, problem not solved. Microphone either works or speakers. cannot use headphones for calling purpose. Your voice is not delivered to other end with this headphones. Now I don't have option for replacement or return. Obviously the seller will tell me to go to BoAt service center which is in mumbai city as shows google map and I live in Pune city. Very bad experience, my all money is wasted by this BoAt brand, I should have bought Audio Technica or scullcandy branded headphones in this same price segment. Utterly disappointing."
1,I had just got this headphones day before yesterday and by seeing them i was happy as they look cool  ...But honestly i will tell u that as  i wear these headphones like just for 2-4minutes while listening songs...my ears start paining and i remove them but still pain was there for a long time for that day .but  yeah song quality is good but still they pain..now today i had request for return of this item
4,"I got this headphone for 599.the build quality of this thing is pretty good it feels solidBass is amazing and overall quality of the sound is also nice no doubt.I am very satisfied with boAt's after sales services.my Headphone got an issue with sound (unfortunately) don't worry that doesn't mean you will also have the same issue it was just a 1 in million caseso I went to service center and without asking a single question they got me replaced with another headphones.one more thing I have to mention that you may feel discomfort after wearing the headphones for quite long, because it is slightly tight, may be eventually it will get loose."
1,Please don't purchase this product. The one side speaker is off within 2 months. The call was disconnected after connecting this headphones.Very bad product.
4,Awesome Sound but jack is not gold plated!
5,It's a original boat product ... Made in China.... Sound quality is awesome ... Disadvantage- It's going blow ur ears... If u don't like bass then don't buy it
5,"Let us go through the advantage and disadvantageAdvantage1) Value for money Head set that is a bass monster and clarity is awesome2) It has a bundled mike so that you can use it to pick up your call on mobile as well.3) Snug fit to the ear and really responsive sound volumeDisadvantage1) NoneI would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a new headset with mike phone. The music quality is mind blowing, awesome."
3,The sound quality is excellent but it hurts the ear lobes after wearing them for 30 mins. Need to put extra cushioning the ones available are not enough. Also it does not have the volume buttons included.making it difficult. Otherwise it's a good buy.
5,If u love listening music... If good sound quality .. Good bass matters to u.. Then definitely buy these Headphones.. Extremely good bass and sound quality .. Durable.. Looks wise really awesome.. Noise cancelation is super awesome.. Don't think just go for it guys.. U won't regret buying these headphones at all.. Grantee..
4,"Everything is good about this headphone. The clarity, noise reduction, bass is all perfect. However after using it for a month the left side stopped working. I raised a complaint with BOAT and within 2 weeks I got a replacement. I appreciate the customer service by BOAT."
1,"The worst headphones i ever bought. Bought these headphones for ‚Çπ749 and when i got delivery the left side of the earphones was giving distorted soundVery bad experience with boat , No sound clearity and no bass quality , its a useless productI m wondering whats the quality checking of this brand , they dont even test their products single time , very bad experience with boat"
5,"I liked the super bass feature and the attached microphone. I purchased SONY headphones and before the year ended and the warranty was over, it was completely DEAD. I hope that BOAT does not end up with the same fate. As one consumer mentioned in the review, when he contacted the makers of the headphone complaining that he should get a replacement for the faulty headphones, the company immediately arranged for a new one. The same happened with me with the SONY product but I got terribly pained running from pillar to post to get a replacement. It NEVER happened. Go for BOAT headphones. They are a value for money. I invested Rs. 799/- and I am truly satisfied with both the microphone and the speaker quality. Thumsb Up !!!"
5,Best In Class.For 799 Rs (Superdeal) I am shocked with its bass and really suggest you to buy. It also comes with a mic for great hands free voice chat.
5,Very nice headphone for all pubg mobile players.. I used to use scullcandy headphone before but the way this headphone work is brilliant.. I can identify footsteps and bullets direction more accurately than before.. Only problem is that if you have by mistakely kept high volume and if you fire akm then it might hurt your ears coz already this is a bass headphone and akm or M762's sound is very high which can give you headache or short-term deafening.. So take care of that.. Overall the product is good
1,"Please don't buy this, The product was good, worked well for two weeks. Then suddenly mic was not working. We tried contacting the customer service for Boat. But no response. Service center also not picking up call. Don't know what to do with this product now, as can't return also already crossed the return timeline due to followup with customer service since three weeks. But no action was taken. Also this is made in China. So suggest don't waste your money for this product."
5,Good Product decent sound Quality in this price range its way beyond expectations. Must Buy for Pure Bass Lovers
5,it has a very nice look and it's worth of money..go for it and there is no chance of repent..
5,"I have purchased white one first and I fall in love with sound quality,build quality,n amazing bass , theater like surrounding sound clarity ant that too at so much reasonable price....immidiatly after a month I got black color n gifted it . Planning to give one more gift to sister....my smiling face talk more than star rating as it's project happy customer experience..... instead of purchasing a earphone worth 500 upgrade to Boat 900 extra bass headphones with microphone.... awesome quality in terms of product,sound,look, comfort with microphone usp at low price point...will add soon after six months another review after using...this is one month review and genuine review from user....."
1,"I bought boAt headphone few months back, not more than 6 months. But its right side damaged and sound is not coming. Now what I shall do? I can't take this and go for a service centre to my nearest town which is 90 km away from my place of residence. Only thing I do is I purchase another headphone either from Sony or Phillips. I advice all not to go for boAt headphones. They are not reliable. This is my experience"
4,Good looking headphone with mic.Sound quality is awesome
3,To be honest you guys this headphone sound quality is horrible too much treble I see all other people claiming it has a allot of base but no I‚Äôm a base lover there‚Äôs no base if you higher up the volume it hurts the ear I didnt expect this I wanna exchange already! This was my first headphone I purchased and Im totally disappointed since I use my apple earpiece it sounds much better than this headphone such a waste of money ! Now another issue it stop working within a month and there is no option to replace also this is a horrible experience ever like thus are the worst thing I‚Äôve ever bought online. Don‚Äôt buy it amazon lies!!! There was no option for warranty since they didn‚Äôt gave any bill or nothing !!
4,"Editing this review after 10 months, so starting with the pro'sSo the Audio quality is good you'll get surrounding feel where it's needed & if you are bass lover then you will like it very much, watching Hollywood movies on it feels great.Build quality is also good, most of the components made with plastic and then some metallic & the cushions are soft and their material quality is also good.Now the conseven though its cushions are soft this headphone is painfull for your ears if you are using it continuously, headphone fits much more tighter on your ears than it has to be so thats why...I was using this headphone with Lenovo vibe K4 note and suddenly it stopped working with it, it was working fine with every other device but stopped working on my device, even my device working well with every other headphones even i tried another bassheads 900 and it was working with my device but my bassheads 900 stopped working with my phone... i know its strange.Then few months later right side of headphone stopped working and then soon after left side gave up.Boat seems very good build quality and sound quality but i experienced 8 out of 10 headphones of boat stops working after some period, But the best thing is if your headphones gets any issue within 1 year then you'll get brand new headphones from Boat, you just have to register product and ask for replacement with details of your headphone issue.Even i got replacement for my product & it's been 2 years since i purchased this headphone and they are working super fine although i had to replace them once because of issue mentioned above."
2,"I bought these for my Son. Both of us use the headphones.The sound quality for the price range is excellent. It got a good Bass, treble could have been sharper. However the biggest issue with this headset, is that it's too tight on the ears ( and I dont have a very big face ).After about 5 mins, your ears start to hurt ( literally hurt ).So while, the sound may be good, it's of no use when you cannot use the head set for more than 10 minutes at a stretch.2 stars only for the reason that these headsets are practically un-usable due to being too tight."
5,"I have been using the headphones since two days and I must say I am quite impressed. By looking at the photos of the product, I thought these are huge headphones. I was equally surprised to see the small box it came in when opened the Amazon packaging. After I took it out of the box, it felt really light in weight. The build quality of the headphones is good. You don‚Äôt feel in anyway that you are holding a cheap product. The fit is really snug. Good amount of cushioning for your years. There is a little bit of cushioning for the headband too which suffices the need. About the sound quality: Listening to music felt good. Nice bass, treble is good, you can hear every sound and tune clearly. However, I felt it needed a bit more sharpness. But hey, what all can you expect from a product at this price. I used it for calls. Voice quality is good. There is a fair amount of booze cancellation on the headphones. Microphone is powerful too. Overall and excellent product for its price. If you are looking for a over the ear headphones and for a good price.... this is your choice."
3,"(Ok so, headphones you buy should be based on who you are (music producer, audio engineer, DJ or a regular person).For non-music produces (normal people):This headphone is ideal for you. Please don't go for studio-quality or expensive headphones for only listening to music (because expensive headphones are for music producers and require a huge amount of power that can't be used with mobile). It comes with a small microphone in one of the wires, is foldable (easy to store even in small bags). BUT, the ear cups are really small to my ears, get heated quickly, so you can't wear it for a long time comfortably. This headphone can be used with all devices and doesn't need a lot of power like the expensive ones. And if you listen to podcasts, I don't recommend it because it is uncomfortable to wear and has bad noise cancellation feature. But if you use headphones for meetings and listening to music, this is perfect for you.For music producers and mixing engineers:I do not recommend these headphones for you. Because if we see the frequency response, it plays sounds from 20-10000 Hz (as far as I can hear). But it plays bass sounds more than other frequencies which can make you biased and wrong decisions while making music and mixing/mastering. Anywhen it comes to power, it is 80 ohms. So please don‚Äôt buy ANY cheap headphones for music producing and I recommend buying headphones that have frequency response clearly mentioned (20Hz to 20000Hz is good) with 250 ohms. Such studio-quality headphones are not cheap though. You can see more studio-quality headphone suggestions for producer s on YouTube.Hope this helps :)"
1,I cannot hear any music from the right side
5,"I will come straight to the point. These are infact a great pair of headphones - but only when you are traveling or require active noise cancellation. Otherwise these are just a decent pair.I have been using this for a while with my laptop & iPhone, for watching Netflix & Prime Video (The Audio Source is anyways brilliant) & listening to music on Prime Music, again, the audio source is great, so I have got a decent experience with the headphones, with nice bass & decent mids. But when you turn the Active noise cancellation, the experience is in a different league - You wont hear any other voice in your vicinity. I have tested this in multiple flights as well. Even if you just turn the noise cancellation on, without any music, it will give a surreal experience, you won't be able to hear any in-cabin flight noise (engines etc.) It has actually helped me have a nice in-flight experience whether to just sleep or watch any movie.Two things which could have been improved upon are -1. With out Noise cancellation listening experience.2. Re chargeable inbuilt battery could have been used."
5,"I have been using BOAT earphone since early thosand 18. And believe me guys this is truly beyond awesome. This is my first purchase after using SONY headphone, SONY is far behind from BOAt, as what i think, after using earphone/headphone of BOAT. I went for this headphone after earpiece of boAt & this is mind boggling. What a sound quality, Hats off 2 the makers of boAt. Awesome bass, treble , u r gonna hear each n every penny of sound clearly. U r gonna be totaly cutoff urself from outer world once u wear this headphone. Its material quality is very good, its totaly durable, light weight. I am giving this review after using 2 week. Dont hesitate go for it guys."
1,"The ear-piece is so tight that ears get hurted within a few minutes of wearing it. It has unnecessary clockwise roation instead of anti-clockwise, such that bottom part of my ear doesn't get surrounded...Even a 5% volume can be heard by a person behind me. And the connector works okay in my laptop, but falls very easily from my mobile phone. Overall product doesn't seems to be sturdy, the wires seems to be can be easily break with just a small strech due to rubber-like substance.Last time I had used Mdr Zx110a which didn't had sound quality as this, but everything was sturdy, comfortable and still working after two years (with 35+ times falls from height and alot of streches), just that it got fungi right now due to moisture conditions...There is no return, only replacement with same product available, I have placed just to be sure if its the problem with only this one or every piece got the same problem."
1,"NOT SATISFIED,1. AMAZING EXPERIENCE WITH MUSIC2. NOT AT ALL GOOD FOR PUBG PLAYERS, YOU WON'T EXPERIENCE BACKGROUND MUAIC OF PUBG LIKE FOOT STEPS ECT.3. MUSIC LEAKS VERY MUCH4. MINE STOPPED WORKING UNDER 20 DAYS5. IF YOU USE IT ROUGHLY THE AUX WILL DEFINITELY GET DAMAGE6. THE CORD WIRE IS VERY VERY VERY LONG, WHICH IS VERY IRRITATING.SOME LAST LINES:-:-ONLY GOOD FOR MUSIC LOVERS, WHICH USE IT RARELY. NOT GOOD FOR GAMING OR ANYTHING ELSE.BE FREE TO ASK ANYTHING ELSE ON MY INSTAGRAM :- ayaanshaikh106"
5,So lets start with build quality it just perfect easily foldable and very light weight had a soft metal strip at top which adjustable according to your head.. the ear coups are small so had some problems with them so there is con and this is only con if u listen to music a lot it best to avoid this since long hours of usage causes pain especially near the ear drum ... Except all the sound quality is just amazing 10/10 for that boat .. also the bass is really good u wiuld be satisfied with that also had a microphone which sounds ok..
4,I am not any critec but on common standpoint I love the feel of this headphone and it has good price to I will definitely suggest this headphone to friends
1,Honestly i didn't like the product at all.. the bass is not good as it claims high bass sound quality.. it's just ok.. secondly I couldn't even wear the headphone for even 5 min.. my ears started to pain.. i tried many times that that's what it is.. the ear pains.. i wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.. 749rs. Is not a small amount that can wasted on products like this..  A big No from my side..
4,"This Boat Ear phone  of mine stopped working in the Mid of April 2020.  It did'nt strike me then to check for the warranty period due to this Covid-19 lock down. Now that I am checking the old orders, I find that its just one year since I brought this product and the warranty too is 1 year.  It lasted exactly for 1 year not more not less. So the immediate question that comes to my mind is ""Is this the quality of a reputed company ""Boat"" ? I have just missed the boat by few days and that too due to this Covid-19 lockdown. Will this qualify for replacement? Please let me know."
1,"Writing this review after using this headphone for 4+ months.Pros:Build and cable quality is good, no wear and tear in cables.Tangle free.Cons:Absolutely 0 on noise cancellation. At 20% volume level, anyone near you can hear everything.Painful to use for longer duration, ears starts hurting as the earpiece is not big enough and sits on the ears.Cannot use it for longer duration.Bass quality and audio quality is average."
5,"First of all Thank You Harman for launching an affordable headphone. Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it. You won't regret afterall it is by HARMAN.#thelongestreview?"
1,Not liked because his product is made in China so that I am returning
5,"Would I recommend this product to others? Definitely yes.Pros:Light WeightBattery LifeCons:No 3.5 mm cable, only blue toothI was in search of a light weight wireless headphone that I can use for long hours. I have a Bose now but I cannot use it for longer than 2-3 hours as its heavy and ears and head start aching.This Infinity one wins there. I have used it for 6-7 hours without any aches or pains.The ear pieces do press a little on the ears unlike over-the-ear ones. This one is on-the-ear.  But it is not uncomfortable and gives a good fit.The sound quality is good too. Noise cancellation is not big. With low volumes, you can hear surrounding noise.Battery does last for a long long time. I used it daily for 4-5 hours for about 3 days with one charge. Am truly impressed with it.And it folds, hence carrying it around is convenient too.And I got it in the lightning deal at 1500 Rs. Worth the price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a non-expensive wireless headphones with a decent sound quality.I am giving it a 4 because I am not sure of its durability. If it lasts foe 6 months at least, then I will come back and update the rating to a 5."
5,"Hi all,After a week rough usage i am sharing my opinion.i through that under 1499 INR i should not expect the headset with all features except sound,but this one made ,my through wrong.One of the best budget product it is. ""Infinity (JBL) Glide 500 Wireless On-Ear Dual EQ Deep Bass Headphones with Mic (Charcoal Black)"".Pros:--1.product quality is good on this price.2.sound quality is extraordinary,especially ""Gaana website songs"" are awesome,prime video streaming sound experience just like a theater.3. Battery backup ~20hrs is good is this product.Cons:--1.aux port not enabled in this version.2.No other reasons here."
1,"Hello Amazon Team,In the Carton box it is mentioned as Manufactured in USA but in the product it mentioned as China . This is breach case , pls look into & Update."
2,"I bought this headphone as a replacement for my in-ear headset. I attend lot of office calls due to WFH. I wanted to have a Bluetooth headphone with great battery life and decent mic quality. To be honest, I can't use these headphones for more than a hour, my ears are paining a lot. The cushioning is very poor and cheap quality. Giving two Star, as it is basic sense to design a headphone with proper cushioning for comfort. People who enjoy too much bass can be happy."
5,This product is better than its old counterpart i.e. JBL infinity 501. With more upgraded features in an affordable price and under a trusted brand. The most catchy thing is it's 36 mm driver and 72 hours playback time as compared to earlier 20 hrs. playback.
1,This is waste of money. Guys Don't go for this headset you will get lot of ear pain and you can't feel any Bass exist in it. Please don't buy it I had purchased later I found such a worst product and returned immediately.
5,"I am impressed with sound quality of Infinity glide 510. It's a value product at a reasonable price. My initial impressions.Pros:1. Good sound quality- mids and highs are clear even with a punchy bass.2.Decent build quality at this price.3.Excellent Bluetooth connectivity and range. I am especially impressed with the range.4. Battery life of 72 hrs which is an unbelievable offer at this price.. (I can't comment on battery life now)5.Pretty decent noice cancellation ( not active)Cons:1.The Deep Bass mode is useless, which spoils the sound quality ( It is set in deep bass mode, you can change it to normal mode by long pressing the volume keys together)2. I could feel the pain on the ears after an hour's usage.I am sure, you won't be disappointed with this product. It's quite a catch at this price. Hope it will be durable."
1,"Highly disappointed and dissatisfied . Can't wear for more than 30 min as it starts to pain , completely against of claims in advertising . Battery backup claimed as 72 hrs ... practically 15 hrs . Cushion on ear cups are not soft enough. Bluetooth disconnected after 7-8 metrs ,  If one scrutinized the reviews well , he can understand that top reviews are paid or Fake ."
5,Its awesome product...thumping base...ears vibrating bass..bery good sound quality and in a affordable pricing...
4,"1#Actually its hell of a product I have been using for quite long and this is what I feel about it:Pros-1.Battery -It has a long lasting battery as about 72hrs( as company claims) but I am sure no one using it for continuous 72hrs but what I felt is that when I unboxed the product it was 80% and after 3 days of regular usage like music,youtube,movies I was able to make 3 days with 50%remaining i.e 30% for 3 days and it took me about 45 min to chagre it up to 80%2.Sound quality and bass-This thing is a beast regarding bass and sound quality I can asure you that this wont even dissappoint you in case of sound quality and for bass,if you bass lover like me it got 2 mode-normal and deep bass.If you cant feel enough bass at normal mode you can easily shift to deep bass mode by pressing +and -button together then you will feel an astonishing bass effect even you can feel the headphone starts vibration at each beat and if this doesnt make you enough then I recommend you to meet an E.N.T for check-up Dude belive me it's crazy3.Bluetooth range-Its just great because its version 5.0 and provide greater range even after crossing 3 rooms you can get adequate range without breaking any signal4.Microphone-its like a bonus because it has good audio recording but the only problem is that it works only during calling i.e you can use it to record or send voice message in whatsapp5.Usage of buttons is just as simple as it seemsLets get to cons:(Only two minor ones)1.comfort-Actually it is only one negative thing I felt about the device after my first usage .It is a bit uncomfortable to wear and you will feel a slight pain over your pinna (external ear )after using for 1 hr ,but now I became adjust to it now I can wear it for hrs without any problem belive me,it can take some time to adjust and after that you won't feel any problem plus it's is weight less and small device so you will easily adjust within one day2.Plastic quality-(It is my feeling that )it seems to be a little fragile during transport especially keeping it in a bag so beware of thatOther than these 2 minor factor I never felt anything bad about this device.So my verdict is that I usually loves to hear music with a good bass and effect and I have used many device from Sennheiser,Ant audio,Jbl,Boat,Skullcandy,Audio technica,Sony and many more so from my experience I will recommend this device to many and I would say THIS IS THE BEST HEADPHONE IN THE MARKET THAT PROVIDE BLUETOOTH AND SOUND QUALITY AT THIS REASONABLE PRICE POINT IF YOU ARE GONNA BUY A HEADPHONE UNDER 1000 JUST PUSH YOUR MAXIMUM TO THIS PRICE POINT IT WILL ALWAYS BE WORTHY.A GOOD PRODUCT FROM HARMAN AUDIO /JBL AS ALWAYS#But all these good factors vanishes because of the horrible comfort that is why I gave 4 star.Otherthan comfort this is awesome"
1,I absolutely hated it from the moment I started using it. It feels so cheap. Even though I was sitting right in front of my laptop it got disconnected multiple times. My ears started to get hot after some time. I'm trying to return it but apparently I can only replace it. DO NOT BUY THIS!! IT IS A SCAM ! U CAN'T GET A REFUND! THEY WILL send u the same thin again!
1,"Pls don't purchase it. It has a sound in right side of headphone. Harman group had told me to send this product. I had parcelled this which cost me around Rs 400. Now they have returned the item again to me without any notice. And when I called, they are saying there is no fault. Such a poor customer service.Sincere request, don't purchase it. It has a prominent sound like vibrating string. Add to this such a poor customer care. Their behaviour is shameless. They should learn from Amazon.Update on 20.nov.19: Customer service of Harman group are shameless. I had some recordings. Everytime they will say we will call you back after 24 hours. But they will never call. I am going to file a case in consumer court.Its not a good headphone at all. Pls purchase other item. Forget about customer care, sound quality is not good. There is a Continous belling soung.Thank you"
3,"SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD, BUT THE HEADPHONES ARE TIGHT AND MAY GIVE YOU PAIN ON LONG USAGE. I have not been able to use it for long time since it's too tight for me... And Irony is Amazon doesn't want give refund to me. I want to go for in-ewr headphones but still they don't want to give the refund. And cherry on cake is Customer care shouts on the customer... @Amazon you need to train your customer care people. Ridiculous experience. Please give my money back if you can so I can have another headphones.Update: Amazon gave my money back, and i was able to buy another headphones. Thank you Amazon."

1,"Hey guys , read this before you buyI bought the headphones 1 month ago which was around 14-15 sep. Everything was going well. Exactly after 1 week, which is 21st sep I used the headphone for 3 hrs to attend some meeting and as soon as I disconnected it the headphones stopped working.  I went to the phone shop they said they won't repair this. I wrote a complain at Harman website they had no response.. please Amazon  have a look at this product and I will wait for the reply.Regards"
5,"Superb clarity. Bass in normal mode is enough, no need to change the EQ setting. Highs are little less bright but still comprehensible. Vocals sometimes feel muddy but looking at the price range, there cannot be better headphones. This is top notch quality in this price. Far better than Boat, far far better. No comparison, in fact. JBL is JBL."
1,"It worked fine for first 2 weeks, It's now less than 15 days and it stopped working.Not sure if It charges properly... I can see the red light while charging. Then click and hold power button to start - power button seems to be not working.Is there any reset button to auto fix settings?It's useless now. I can't return it as after 10 days as per return policy. I have 1 year warranty. I don't know how to claim that.It's not a good experience."
5,"The build and sound quality of this thing is awesome. I upgraded to this after my Sennheiser cx 180 street ii broke. For all those who are wondering it comes with a 610 mah battery. I am by no way a audiophile but the sound i feel is excellent. It was by default in bass boosted mode and i switched it back to normal. Battery life, Durability all those things will be updated in a future update. I feel it was a bit uncomfortable for large head, mine is xl üòù but not that troublesome (3/5 for comfort). Edit : The sound of the headphone is excellent after burning in for more than 10 hours. You get used to the headphones after sometime. So yeah its more comfortable now. 2 days of 3 hour per day use in medium volume gets battery down by 10%. Buy this thing eyes closed."
4,"I purchased this on 28 August, it was delivered on 31 August. The delivery was good. Now to the headphones,this headphones has all the things you need to called this headphone. I mean the sound quality is excellent. Bass is good. No distortion in taking calls and decent build quality. It kinda look like jbl t460bt younger brother. I have given 4* because it has a minor issue of producing a sound like ""ting ting"" when you touch or tap right side of the headphones. But it doesn't bother that much so it's a sweet deal. Hope you can enjoy this product.Update: 27 may 2020- I have been using this for past 8 months and their sound quality is best considering it's battery life and build which is far good than other headphones available. The only one drawback is their are not much comfortable. So if you can compromise a bit then go for it."
1,"This is made in China product (written on the box). It's showing it's nature from first day. If sound is not played for 3-4 min and then you play any sound the headphones will not respond until you until you pair it again. I don't know if it is happening with me only. In one hour I noticed 3-4 time sound stopped for like half sec which I did not expected from JBL, me and my phone were on same bed .Sound is nice but breaking half sec between songs is not acceptable. Bad bluetooth connection.I literally search JBL is US brand but still they have quility like Chinese products."
5,"Mind Blowing 3D surround sound Experience, I have sennheiser and Sony headphone but really this headphone is amazing, every notes and vocal r clear and bass is very very very awesome when u r switched in powerful bass such u feel with new bass experience. Overall I give full rate 5/5"
5,"Here is my detailed review of this product after a week of usage:1. Build quality:Earlier was sceptical a bit about on-ear headphone that the outer ear will pain after long use. But this one comes with great built, comfort, lightweight and handy that one can use for longer period without any discomfort.2. Sound quality:I'm an audiophile. Love to hear every single frequency from low to high and set my theatre for the same. Here comes the sound of this product it'll really produce the low frequency approx 80-100hz which is really good for such small speaker resulting good bass, clear sound with balanced trable.Noise cancellation is as expected. You'll be cut out from outer world.3. Bluetooth control and battery:Bluetooth is working as expected and can be achieved at a distance of 10-15 mtrs. Control buttons are good with proper sensitivity battery lasted 18 hours of regular use.Over all a nice product from Herman and can buy without having second thoughts."
5,"This is my first Bluetooth Overhead headphone.Reason why I do not prefer Bluetooth headphone is due to its poor battery backup and sound quality, I always prefer Wired headphones also for its sound quality.But this headphone is a game changer1. Battery Backup: this headphone is really great in the battery backup. I was an average listener and game player. So it was giving a backup for more than a week easily for me. I never thought of charging it from the day I bought it.2. Sound effect: The sound is absolutely good with some equaliser and it‚Äôs best with power amp, and some music player which has custom equaliser in Android. If you are iPhone user and wanna enjoy music in default music player , then it‚Äôs not for you. However we can install some third party music player with equaliser and enjoy the music (eg: onkyo player).And the best part of the headphones is enjoying a movie with deep bass mode. If you are looking for a headphone to enjoy movies for long time with best bass boosted high volume sound effect then go for this without thinking. I really enjoy watching Marvel collections since I‚Äôm marvel fan. Oven never enjoyed such a deep bass anywhere. Even in laptop the movies sounds great with VLC media player(subjected to best equaliser settings).3. Comfort: The headphone gives a great comfortable tight fit. I‚Äôm a big head guy and it‚Äôs really so hard. I can‚Äôt wear it for more than 20 min. But I gave the same headphone to my brother and sister, everyone is comfortable wearing for so long. So I wear it in a different angle and it helps me to fit comfort. This is definitely for round headed people, it has a huge extension but still there is no adjustment for horizontal flexible adjust fit.4. Build Quality: So good and sturdy. Light weight and foldable.5. Noise Cancellation: It gives a nice noise cancelling sound environment with more than average volume level. Compression is perfect for normal head. Since I have round and huge head, it is not giving perfect closure to ears if I extend the length of the adjustment. That‚Äôs the only problem for me. Never mind if you are normal headed.Mic: During call and gameplay I never had a complaint from other end. They can hear my voice clearly.Drawbacks: It does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack and I can‚Äôt enjoy the Dolby Atmos effect from my laptop. For this extreme bass headphone if it gives me option to connect and enjoy the music I would be so happy. But it can‚Äôt be bundles with all futures right. That‚Äôs negligible for me.Overall it‚Äôs a Best Buy for the price range. I really enjoy it and my family is enjoying with this headphone.Thanks"
4,"I wasn't able play pubg connecting with this headset, you will get the fire sound or foot sound with delay of 2 seconds so you can't sync the sound of game which you hear in headset and game play."
4,Sound is good but will only work with mobileNot with laptop or anyother device
5,Infinity Glide 500 is very accurate in terms of sound quality. Build quality seems to be not so good because all is plastic. I was comparing this with Jbl T460 bluetooth headphone. The INFINITY GLIDE 500 is having puncy bass. I could say that bass is little bit overpowering...there is option to switch ON the deep base mode but believe me friends I could never feel the need to enable deep base mode. The bass is too much even in normal mode. So bass lovers will like this headphone for sure. Please allow some time to burn the headphone to produce quality sound. First day you may not feel the headphone good but believe me from second day I was just in love with this as it produces sharp details. So burning time is required to free up the components of headphone. Battery backup is tremendous...as compared to Jbl T460. Jbl T460 has just 11 hours whereas this headphone has 20 hours backup. Price is also very low.Thanks.UPDATE AFTER USING 3 WEEKS:This headphone has really became my travel mate...This has bluetooth 5.0 and it does not even disconnects in Mumbai crowded local trains. Your phone should support bluetooth version 5.0 and it will connect with this headset seamlessly. Lower bluetooth versions are also supported of course...But 5.0 is great for connectivity and battery optimization.EQ mode is not that great and it does not give any difference and there is really no need to push for deep base....it is just awesome in normal mode....Flexible to carry and travel...Great headphones.
2,"I was expected a lot from this Bluetooth headset, but disappointed very much.It like a normal piece, not worth to buy for Rs1700"
1,"Today, I have received Glide 500 wireless on-ear headphone. But the product is not as good as I have heard abt it. I purchased it for brand name HARMAN but sound quality especially Bluetooth connectivity is so irritating that I prefer to return this. I played music on ganna app as well as songs available in my phone but same problem exist both the time. Every 4-5 seconds a interruption occurred and sound became low. So I recommend not to buy this."
5,"Highly recommended for beginner producers, the mids need to be a bit more enhanced but the thing we need to keep in mind is that these are Headphones worth INR1500 NOT INR15k. The product is covered under 2 years warranty which is a great thing.If you really want to know how flat these headphones are I will highly suggest you to download ""Sonarwarks Reference 4"", It's a paid software but you get a 21days free trial without adding any card details.*BONUS TIP*Most of you must be wondering what kind of review is this? where is the usual pros & cons section?Well, what works for me may not work for you, There is a debate in our industry since decades about the best budget headphones which you already searched or might search really soon, Some will suggest you about ATH M40x, Some will say Sony MDR 7506, Some people use ATH M50x for mixing (literally) and some say it has high bass, some say DT770 pro is great for mixing other say it has a V-shaped frequency.""Flat"" headphones & speakers are just a MYTH, It's just BS, these are not my words, These are words of Bob Power (44 years of experience & still active in the studio, platinum producer. wanna know more? Google him) The real art is that you should know your headphones, A producer/mix engineer can produce GREAT mix on these headphones (or any low budget) compared to an amateur who has the world's best studio.  I have seen many masterclasses and read tips by many people who just say one that that only thing that matters is ""your hearing"", If you can train your ear and then understand your headphone then you can make a great mix, Learn from the bottom before getting costly 10k headphones after reading someone else's review, YOU WILL REGRET LATER ON, Initially you will love the product (Because it's better than what you have been listening to, Obvious psychology) but your ear will develop around those headphones, according to their frequency. I am again repeating initially you will be like ""this is the best thing ever, everything is so clear, OMG OMG. I love them."" Train your ear as much you can, As said above get 21days trial version of Sonarworks and listen to as much music, bypass it via software then listen to original headphone sound and you will just understand the difference and 21 days is enough time to understand any headphone if you are dedicated and passionate about learning music.""World won't listen to your music on the same pair of headphones (be it any pair), you need to develop a certain taste and check the mix in multiple sources and it can be your laptop speaker, your cellphone, your TV, your car speaker you need to find a way where it sounds good everywhere, This is what mixing is all about of course including EQing and adding FX""I also recommend reading ""Bobby Owsinski's book: A mixing Engineer's Handbook"" if you don't have any source to learn.Good luck with your venture.The video I am talking about Bob is on youtube, Search: Mixing Masterclass with Bob Power [MixCon 2017]WATCH THE FULL VIDEO, You might not understand most of it (if you are a beginner and no knowledge about the DAW he's using) but your brain will absorb these things and will definitely help later on. First 15-20 minutes is a must watch."
5,"Pros:1- Light weight2- Ear cap/bud is soft and big. My ears are big, they got perfectly fit inside it. Finally got headphones which are not creating any pain in my ear while using for 6-8 hours.3. Length of wire is somewhere around 3-4 meters, which is really nice to use on desktop computer.4. Sound quality is great for vocals. I recommend for content creation enthus and gamers who need to hear clearly.5. Noice cancellation is not the best but it is far better than any other headphones in the same price range.6. If you want to learn any new language, these are the headphones for you.Cons:1- For people who want to listen music only on these headphones will be disappointed because it has very low bass.PS: Previously I used ""Motorola Pulse 3 Max"" as compared to that, these are light and ear cup is not making any pain in my ear. Really happy with these headphones."
4,As this headphone comes with closed dynamic drivers. You'll get very crisp and clear sound with very good amount of bass. Bass is not very high but not very low. It's very well balanced. These earcups fits quite well around your ears and provide you very good noise cancellation. This headphone is great for watching movies. So if you guys prefer a good over ear headphone which is not too tight on your ears but provide a very good noise cancellation and give you crisp and clear sound with a very good amount of bass and with very long cable you can go for this one. Sound feels little bit low compared to other headphones in this budget and there's no mic in this headphone but I think this headphone is mainly used for watching movies as it's provide very good experience. If you want more bass you can go for boat bassheads 900 or Sony XB450 but i remind you they're on ear headphone
1,"Very bad product design. The sponge in headphone phone is non-breathable. So absolutely no space for your natural sweat to get out. Eventually after 10-15 mins of use, when i removed the headphone, my whole ear was sweaty and uncomfortable. I have a normal ear and i don't have perspiration problems. So very cheap design by engineers and great marketing. I fell for its brand name and low price. sound quality is okay and price is low. But whats the point if you can't wear it longer. Don't buy it. Period! if you still want to buy it, go ahead because i also bought it after reading a similar bad review. Its called fate!"
5,Excellent headphones . Sennheiser headphones are best . It's German brand and has quality sound . Built quality is so much premium . It covers whole ear .
5,"Sound: 4.8/5 It could have been better. But then again, it's more than worth the price.Build Quality: It's plastic but it seems quite strong enough to hold on some weight if they are in your bag or anything.Weight: Headphones weight is something to be concerned of. Just 30 minutes and you'll start to realize that ""Sar par Bhoj"".Bass Line: Perfect to watch movies, listen to songs. FLAC quality is something which feels so pure in these headphones.Treble line: Upto the mark. I'd say just perfect.Sound Balance: Perfect 5/5Noise Cancellation: 4/5Overall, it's worth the price. Its been almost 3 months of regular usage."
3,"Just an average over the ear headphone,not much bass.headphone cables are too long so not preferable for mobile phone users, forced to tie it for smooth using as shown in the image.This one is light weight so good for long time usage.and plug is straight one so not doesn't feel comfortable for mobile gamer's .it's just an average product,so don't expect much from this and this is not refundable,you can only get replacement.so choose wisely,if I have an option for refund I will surely go for it."
5,"I wanted a good pair of headphones that will not die in 6 months like my previous earphones did (Xiaomi In ear Pro, Panasonic RP 125). There is also Sony XB 400 headphone but I choose this instead because1. I don't like extra bass. This one is more balanced sound.2. This one have 2 year warranty. Sony have 1 year.3. This is over ear headphones while sony one is on ear.I'll update my review if anything happens. Overall I'm satisfied."
4,"Before I write this review, I'd like to add a small disclaimer. I'm a music producer in the commercial scene, although very few people actually listen to the tracks I've produced. For hearing all the details in the music I create, every little intricacy, these headphones are useful as studio monitors. The sound quality is unparalleled in this price segment. In addition, if you're in your bedroom, listening to music on your PC, these are perfect. However, due to a number of reasons these are impractical as headphones for your smartphone. Firstly, the wire is so long, that if you ever took it with you outside, you'd trip or cause tears in the wire. It goes without saying, don't take these with you when you are cycling. Secondly, the joints for the ear cups are so inflexible that they break with ease. Luckily, this doesn't hamper your listening experience *much*, because rather than being connected to the bridge, the headphone wiring is connected directly to the cups. You'll see what I mean if you accidentally break them, which is very likely to happen. Also, if you ever connect these to your phone, these will constantly disconnect in case you have a TPU cover on your phone (has happened more times than I can count, with my Realme XT). The noise cancellation is useful when you're working on your PC and don't want to be disturbed. However, the volume is simply too low when you've connected it to your phone, so just don't buy it if you intend to use it as a pair of headphones for listening to Spotify on your phone. Tl;dr great for music production and hearing intricacies in songs and movies, good for gaming on your PC, nigh useless for anything else."
5,"First Cx-180 And Now HD-206 :) I had been a fan of Sennheiser CX-180 and their replacement scene at service centers is mindblowing. Once i was in and out in under 5 mins, with a replacement device in Mumbai Center @ Andheri.About the HD-206:Why to by : You are tired with IN-Ears and the pain that it causes after using 5 hr straingt, its time to TRY a OVEREAR headphone, you have not much money but need a good brand witih good after sales service.About the sound : NO extra BASS, clear soundBuild : Light and eventhough is quite plastic, looks good.. remmeber its 1.5k and not 15k. The cord is pretty long. You can do skipping while listening music. I could walk in my room without unpligging it from the computerAll n All unless you like the BASS like the Rickshwala this one is BEST choice for the cost it comes :P"
4,"I purchased this product so as to view my online lecture videos even if im in library or the metro. These heaphones are serving the purpose decently. Too loud a sound will cause externalization of sound so that the neighbouring person can hear. An ample 75% volume is good enough.About Noise cancellation, at 75% volume, the sounds greater than 1m radius tend to cancel.At volume greater than 75%( i tried at 85%, 90% and 100%), complete cancellation of sounds from sides. You may hear some sound from the back, due to the foam quality.Moving on to the comfort, it is ok to wear these headphones for a max of about 30 to 45min. It tends to cause pain and foam is of average quality. Cant blame company, given the price. My suggestion is to take short breaks from your activity( be it watching lectures like me or videos/movies) for every 30 min and relax your ears for a min. Else any longer can cause severe pain to your earlobes.All this is written here is from personal experience of these headphones .If you have the money to spare, then please buy the sennheiser 4.2 bt headphones or sony wired headphones. They cost about Rs.3000.If you are on budget and need a headphone for noise cancellation purpose, to study without disturbance or to watch movies on computer, yeah this can be decent choice."
4,"I was looking for budget OVER EAR headphone and this looks to be only option available for me at the time of buying.Pros -Good looking , good pads and fits very well for me, gold plated connector, feels not bulky and cables are not too soft show won't get tangle much. Comes with extra thick gold plated audio connector as attachment for musical instruments.Cons - It comes with long non detachable cable ,Sound quality is Ok but if someone looking for High bass and loud one then skip this one.Over all -Its good and satisfies my need as I was looking for branded over the ear budget headphone .May be best for studio monitor headphones or for desktop as cable is long one."
4,"Context:I'm writing this review after comparing HD 206 with my existing Sony headphone (I forgot the model; It was bought some 7 years ago for a similar price ~Rs. 800)If you have used a similarly priced headphone from a reputable company in the recent past, you won't notice much difference, except moderate difference in sound reproduction. However, with the singular comparison I made, HD 206 lacks in bass - it's barely noticeable even when adjusted from the source front. Which is not something bad by itself, just that you may not like it that much if you prefer your music to have a little bass. On the plus side, vocals will sound cleaner.Build: It's plastic but felt reasonably sturdy. My existing headphone has an even thinner band but I've managed it fine for so many years. So this shouldn't be a problem. If it matters, the ear cushion has some sort of leather _like_ thin material around it, which I feel will peel off eventually. Not sure if that'd be a problem other than an exposed sponge collecting dust with use.Comfort: I've a normal sized head (for an adult male) and there was nothing wrong with the fit. The ear cups were able to fit snugly around my ears. Though it felt a tad tighter, I believe the fit will loosen up eventually. I did sense my ears getting a little warmer with use but that may be dude to the tight fit. I've not tested for hours to talk much about comfort.Should you buy it?Yes, but manage your expectations. We're talking about a $20ish product here.In my experience no amount of reading reviews will match real life usage - which applies to many products. We all have the desire to find the absolute best product out there but it comes at a steep cost - not just money - but time & effort as well. Also beyond a point increase in quality won't justify the difference in price.So, don't worry too much about sound quality; any decent source can drive this item very well and I guarantee you will get accustomed to the sound and enjoy your music just fine. Needless to say, if you've strong opinions and can _actually_ notice subtle difference in such technical qualities as quantum temporal frequency perceptions or whatever, this product isn't for you. This is the Toyota of headphones; not to be compared with Ferraris and Lamborghinis."
1,"My brief yet consummate analysis on Sennheiser HD 206 ...I had the luxury of using HD 202 and HD 180. They weren't the world class ones - HD 202 reproduced to some extent decent Bass while HD 180 just managed ''business'' with different performances on laptop,desktop and mobile platforms, but they did well on earmarking indicators.Positives: Design that looks more sophisticated and progressive to onlooker ....Negatives: No sound clarity as some users had earlier highlighted; no sound enhancement on an advanced phone from Nexus family from LG - its earphones were marvellous with Dolby-like enhancement; no clear treble; Bass ???; Compared to this look-a-like moder headset, SAMSUNG and LG manufactured numerous products.My judgment: Just DO NOT go in for this unless you're hard pressed for making yourself a fool! Others are good from the German sound engineering product factory. I inserted CX-180 for consideration. It's too cheap compared to this one, and is better than Audio Technica and Sony."
5,"Compared to the popular boat bassheads900 I am using I can tell, even though this products bass is not  that good, it's clarity has met senheisser standards and is much better than the other..also much better in terms of noise cancellation, but since the ears are inside the ear cups the ears can get a little bit hot in warm countries"
1,"pros- ok build quality- comfortable to wearcons- average sound quality- unintuitive buttons- if you are using these headphones with laptop, be warned that volume control buttons on the headset will not work with Teams/Skype.  you have to adjust volume level by master control on laptop. I have a long discussion with Sennheiser; unfortunately the test engineer with whom i spoke, did not have the model they are selling in India! That is the very definition taking customer for a ride- it is difficult to disconnect an existing device, the buttons will make the headphones switch off. if your devices are in two different places, then it is very annoying to disconnect the other device.- i bought this to have a better headset as compared to boat 510, but i might have saved 3000 rupees.Overall, i would say not to buy this.After few weeks of use: the headphone slips off frequently. I wish i could request amazon to stop listing this product. It is unfortunately that bad."
3,These are great headphones for watching movies. I could hear every single sound just like in a theatre. Your ear may feel slight pain after long use so may be dont use them for hours at a time.It doesnt have much bass so not that great for music.Pros: lightweightgreat for watching movies/vocalcovers your ears completelycheapgood material uselong wireCons: .not bassfulnot made for musicear pain after long uselong wire
1,"At the time of my ordering, all the reviews I could see on the product page belonged to an older, yet great entry-level Sennheisers wired headphones called HD 206. The HD 250BT doesn't sound, doesn't fit well neither do they feel good in the hand.You remeber the age old song walkmans that worked with tapes and 2 cells? Those walkmans had a pair of free headphones. This headphone build just as basic as that. You know they'll break in 3 months.While I have the HD 280s, I expected these to have a slightly different sound, if not better. Truely disappointed."
5,It's a great headphone. The sound is almost flat so can be used as a budget friendly alternative for audio monitors. Though it won't provide actual flat sound as higher alternatives for professional works.The delivery was very prompt. I got it pretty quickly and in good packaging with no hassle. My friend was so impressed with mine that he asked me to order another one for him.
5,"Pros -Amazing sound qualityGood amount of detailsGood noise isolationWire quality goodLight weightComfortableCons -Very long wire - 10 feet approx why?Gets uncomfortable after 1 hour of useNow coming to the negative reviews regarding low soundGuys you are buying a headphone it has impendence level , you will not get loudness from your phone . Research before buying, these headphones are not for phones , these are musicians headphones, needs an amp to function.works good with laptop.these are used in production, not for your music listening or badshah songs .For bass lovers I would say these are not for Tony Kakkar songs or badshah songs , if you are into that stay away . These headphones are for audiophiles or music producers . If you love jazz , blues , classical or anything apart from bass go for it , you will have the pleasure to hear every instrument clearly.Tip:- let it burn for atleast 48hours  , then it will sound better ."
5,"Hell yeah! This headphone could easily be 3000 rupees, and trust me; I have even used the high-end ones.Pro:  The sound quality for the price is unspeakable. It gives me true sound. The bass could be a little better, but not something you will notice if you did not mix the track. This is the Sennheiser quality that we know of. The earcups are pretty good, and I can keep the headphone on for a long time without it hurting my ears. Sound leak is pretty much non existent for general usage. The wire is looong, so I can basically move around my room without having to unplug it.Con: I wish the quality of the wire was better. I mean cmon, you make a great quality headphone; why not make it sturdy too? I dunno, may be because they want you to buy from them again in near future lol."
3,"Brought this head phone as I was a fan of Sennheiser PMX60 which become very old.Pros: Clarity is good as always with SennheiserCons:- Ears tend to sweat with a couple of mins, not for use in non-ac or summer weather- Cord is very long as described, so not good for using on Mobile while you are on the Move.- Bass very minimal, not for bass lovers- Felt the sound was very flat"
1,"I have used this product for one year. In simple words, it's just not good.- Comfort is low, ears hurt on prolonged use. Takes a lot of time to break into/get used to- Sound volume is low and bass is low. Sound is clear and balanced though- The long wire is an issue, you think it won't be but it is- The build quality is decent but not great- They are large and not very portable But most importantly, after 1 year, the right side has no audio.Very disappointed."
5,"I never expected such a good quality headphone for this price point. If you are accustomed to the Bass heavy cheap Chinese headphones please stay away from this one. This head phone is a very neutral headphone with no thumping bass. This headphones are for those who really love music and would like to listen to all the sounds which normally are missed when played through cheap chinese headphones. One small draw back I felt about this head phone is that you have to increase your volume from your usual settings. What I mean is that when I use my Sony's high end headphone the volume I normally keep is around 15 to 20, but when I use this Sennhessier headphone I have to bump it to 25 to 30 levels to get that same volume. Apart from that there is no issue at all."
5,"For this price, sound quality is nice. I mainly listen to rock music so this headset gets the job done. Sound clarity is really good.For gaming, it's decent and I can hear footsteps so it helps and can be used.Now, for tv shows and movies on the ps4, it's usable at max volume but honestly, it could have been slightly louder.The main con of the product is the really long wire. This wire is probably more than 10 ft long. The other con is not being loud enough.Overall, for this price- 4.5. Sound quality is impressive and saves it from a worse rating.There's also a cushion just below the top of the headset so it's comfortable. I've been using it for over 8 hours in a day for gaming, watching shows on Prime and listening to music.So far, so good."
1,feel very uncomfortable to a point of being unusableears will get sweaty feels like a huge weight on you headridiculously long cableear cups too small no cushion no breathing spacesound quality is mediocre2 years of warranty is goodupdate: 4months in the jack is broken you have to twist and bend it to get audio can't claim warranty due to covidI know sennheiser their service is best by far I have encounteredI wanted to refund and return but I can't do that be aware before buying
1,"Got a defective product, the left side of the earphone got seperated from the body. Later on I found out that 6.3mm adapter plug is also not included.So I ordered a replacement, lets hope for the best.I'll update it when i got the replacement.Update:Got a replacement and now it is sealed packed, better packing and cover, No broken parts, very good sound quality (this is my first time I purchased a studio quality headphone) so it is the best i have ever get. So I'd like to recommend this to everyone who want a studio quality headphone at a budget price. I'd not rather change the rating since i got a broken piece at my first order.Have a great day/night."
4,"After a lot of research I ordered this headphone during sale and got it @ 999. Headphone is good, balanced sound quality. Not too much treble and bass. The only con is the sound volume which is very low. It's not that loud. I always feel if I can increase a little more volume. So if I  say that it would have been better to have 125% of the volume. Else all good.I am using DFX to increase the volume."
2,"If you're looking for a headphone that you would use as a reference, meaning to get an idea about how things should really sound, this is a bad choice. It's frequency response is available on rtings website. I thought a simple high shelf filter would make the treble sound ok but it didn't work out.The problem is that 5 6 kHz region dips and is immediately followed by peaks at 8 10 kHz giving it a strange sizzling sound. I wasnt interested in great bass or anything. Just wanted a good neutral sound. Unfortunately it fails and equaliser won't help,  neither will the Sonarworks profile adjustment because of sample variation. Each headphone will sound slightly different so applying the sonarworks profile EQ actually makes the sound even stranger.You'll read a lot of reviews that will say this is a great headphone for beginner audiophiles etc. Problem is that these guys go online searching for headphones, latch onto fancy terminologies used by other reviewers and use it ignorantly in their own reviews while not realizing that the product really sounds off. I won't judge them too harshly because unless you compare at least a few different headphones, earphones side by side it really is unlikely that you'll realize that something sounds wrong. I was happily using the Samsung in ear earphones that used to come with older smartphones thinking they sounded great. But after I started experimenting with an eq on my PC, reducing, increasing certain frequency bands, trying to judge which eq adjustment sounded better, I realized how much better they sounded after I found the proper eq adjustment. Now I feel shocked with the kind of sound I used to be satisfied with.The point is, unless you currently only own really cheap earphone, the kind sold on trains or on the roadside for 100 bucks, you already own a device that you can equalize and experiment with to see if you manage better sound from the same earphone, headphone. I use APO Equaliser on my PC. It's free, try it out.Also, apart from the frequency response, the treble is quite grainy but I was expecting that since these are budget headphones. Other problem is distortion. If someone with a particular voice shouts in a video this headphone will sound hazy and broken up.If you are dead set on wanting to purchase headphones I recommend boat bass heads or even the bluetooth variants. They dont distort like the HD 206 and have a better bass and slightly better sound overall. They're frequency response isnt perfect either, but they are cheaper distort less and like I said above, use eq adjustments, find out which adjustments reduce sharpness etc. (Tip: reduce 4-6 kHz region using eq and reduce 80 to 200 Hz region for the wired boat bass heads)EQing cheap products to get a decent frequency response is the real 1st step people interested in enjoying music should do rather that thinking that cheap variants from well established brands would provide an upgrade.When I caught the reference headphone bug, that is, when I still used my Samsung earphones unequalized,  I bought the Audio Technica ATH M20x after seeing so many good reviews. Same disappointment. Strange treble peak that made watching movies a punishment, too sharp, so I returned it. When I discovered rtings.com I check it's freq response and sure enough there was a big spike in the treble. All Audio Technica ATH M series headphones sound bad. See all of their frequency responses on rtings or even on Sonarworks they all have a bad upper bass hump and treble peaks around 10 kHz.I recommend Oluvsgadgets and Metal571 on YouTube for reviews. Oluvsgadgets is really unique in that the person actually records the audio of speakers, headphones and allows us to to get an idea about the differences between 2 products and shares his opinion on which he feels sounds better, this is in contrast to other reviewers that simply talk about how they liked or disliked a product which is pointless as most will have a positive opinion on some really bad products. Highly recommend checking oluvsgadgets on YouTube.Also, if you aren't bored already reading my rant, know this : ""burn in"" is bad concept. People think after some time of usage the sound of  a headphone or speaker changes for the better. There is no real proof of this. You'll just find people writing lofty claims about how much better the sound gets after a week etc. There are quantitative studies. In fact, hilariously what does increase with usage is Harmonic distortion. Truth is, one gets used to the sound of a new headphone/ speaker. What sounded a bit alien the 1st time one hears a new product becomes familiar and comfortable after a while because we simply get used to the sound. So it's actually our comfort level and familiarization  with the sound that makes it appear as though the sound has improved over week.Lastly, be open to accepting the fact that the product you may think sounds good may not be so.Do yourselves a favour and do see Oluvsgadgets on YouTube."
5,"Disclaimer: I‚Äôm an audiophile, and I bought these phones for someone else‚Äîso I might be a little too critical.I think these are great value for money; if you want a pair of headphones that are better than your phone or laptop earphones, 2K for this set is great. Unfortunately, the sound is just about acceptable‚Äîbut I *have* listened to earphones/headphones that cost 1K or so, and these sound *much* better. In short, if you‚Äôre looking at something in this price range, this set is *perfect*‚Äîbut don‚Äôt expect anything spectacular just because they‚Äôre Sennheisers.The sound (music and movies; I don‚Äôt play games) is too plain, like I said‚Äîso using surround virtualising software, software equalisers, etc., here‚Äôs what I found:(1) Detailing: 5/5: These headphones cost just 2,000 rupees but I can hear sounds I hadn‚Äôt heard before in familiar pieces of music. It‚Äôs here that people familiar with Sennheiser will recognise the brand.(2) Bass: 4/5: The phones can handle high bass surprisingly well.(3) Mids: 5/5: Voice and other mid frequencies are fantastic (again, for this price): I was amazed to make out so many lyrics I‚Äôd been getting wrong in songs!(4) Treble: 3/5: The treble is where I‚Äôd complain as far as the phones go‚Äîbut using effects software or an equaliser, you shouldn‚Äôt have a problem.(5) Volume: 3/5: With a ‚Äúcommon‚Äù laptop or phone, the sound can be too low; you might need a software/app volume boost of some kind.(6) ...And a 5/5 for comfort. The cord (two-sided) is really long, which is great; the cups are just slightly too tight, but the band stretches enough to help you avoid discomfort.Overall: If this is your price range, don‚Äôt think twice; these are perfect. If you‚Äôre looking for ‚ÄúSennheiser sound‚Äù‚Äîforget it."
5,"It is quite difficult to find a comfortable affordable very good quality headphone.This headphone is very light on the head however I can anyone do light jogging with it. Eh150 was my first Sennheiser headphone and it was almost like a clamp over my ears. It appears to me that this has even better audio quality then ATH M 30 x. The dynamic range at least for me is broad, I can hear clear voices higher frequencies and also decent bass. So far battery also last quite long however needs to be seen how long it lasts.The only question is- the two exposed wires if they could be difficult to maintain , however, only time will tell.Totally recommended, changed my opinion about over ear headphones"

5,"Just got it and saw the Lion King trailer. I can't believe that a 1200+ rupees headphone has produced this sound. Take a bow Sennheiser. (Note that I'm new to headphones, but it is amazing.) Awesome! It feels as if I'm in a state of the art theatre."
5,"Wanted a not so expensive but workable wired headphone to play and also record my electric guitar.PROSCost effective.No nonsense pricing.Very good Clarity. Indvidual sounds clear.Capable headphone for Home studio.No Over powering bass.Neutral sounds.Long wire.

4,"I bought this after my sennheiser hd 202 headphone finally started breaking down after 5 years of amazing experience. This review will be a comparison with hd 202 as i was totally satisfied with it for daily usePrice wise: this is cheaper despite being the later model, so was pleasantly surprised. But they have cut some corners to save costsSound Quality: Bass is definitely softer than hd 202 and I have to run it at a higher volume setting. I found the sound crisper though. But electronic genre sounded better in 202Noise cancellation: it is unfair to expect noise cancellation in a product priced at this range, but it muffles external sounds better than 202Ergonomics: its tighter around the ear, so not sure how comfortable it will be for long hours at a stretch. The cushioning is harder (but not bad) than 202. Also, the cups don‚Äôt extend much unlike 202, which could be an issue for larger heads.Bottom line: at this price point, one shouldn‚Äôt really complaint as it is a total value for money. It works really well for day to day use. I have a bose qc ii for serious listening/guided meditation. Buy this one without second thoughts"
5,"I Will write a detailed review,so that anyone trying to buy these or deciding on buying these Headphones have all the information, to make an informed decision.Price: 1500 RupeesDate: July 2020Pros:1. Great audio quality: These Headphones sound good, I haven't really used any high-end headphones so these sound really great to me, tested surround sound with these headphones great quality.2. Really Long Cable: I use these headphones with my pc for gaming and watching movies. The cable is around 3 meters, didn't measure, but had to tie it up so that it won't get stuck to my chair.3. Comfortable for only 3 hours: These headphones have a leathery foam around the ears and don't press that tight on the head, but when you wear these for more than 2 hours you start feeling your ears sweating a lot.4. Durable: Bought a Year Ago, still working great with no issues for my product, but seen some reviews saying it stopped working after 2 weeks, 2 months, 2 years, etc. Verify other reviews and test the headphones rigorously in the product return period so you can replace your defective product.Cons:1. Made of plastic: All headphones under 3000 are mostly plastic, which makes them not so durable and prone to damage. actually dropped the headphones a couple of times, but didn't break, that's good enough for me.2. low volume in windows and ubuntu: These headphones definitely need a DAC to make the audio loud enough to enjoy music, the quality is great, just not loud enough for me.  - tried to boost the volume using equalizer apo and Dolby atmos app but still, the overall sound is low.3. No Mic: these headphones are strictly for listening, there is no mic with these headphones, I like that because it's better to do one great thing than 2 crappy things.4. No ANC: These are just plain ordinary headphones, with no advanced features, don't expect active noise cancellation with these headphones you have to buy headphones in the price range of 10k to get a decent pair of ANC headphones."
2,"Just as the title mentions, these headphones do sound flat and neutral, without any unwanted colouration of any frequencies, but the main drawback is the complete lack of output volume. When connected to the phone or even a laptop, even on max volume, it is barely audible. This basically renders these headphones useless. To top it off, when I connected them to a high quality DJ mixer (Pioneer DJM 750) headphone out, the volume knob had to go all the way up to 3'o clock for them to be audible. Also, tracks with low bass caused the drivers to distort terribly. Hence, in my opinion, the really low volume output and the tendency for them to distort when pushed even a little bit, renders them useless."
5,"A very good quality all rounder headphones.NOT for bass lovers. Its not very punchy with the bass, more of a moderate bass.A definite buy for first timers to Sennheiser.Budget headphones.Only con is after a year of use, (and also depends on type of abuse) the leatherette starts coming of the headphone pads piece by piece. Have to manually remove it.Would definitely recommend this purchase."
5,"I first saw this product in a recording studio and was blown away with the quality. I took picture of it immediately and came home and searched for it on amazon and placed the order. Works amazingly well. The sound quality is crystal clear and you also receive an aux pin along with it, which is of great quality. You can connect it to your usb audio interface to experience best sound quality.  ( YES YOU WILL RECEIVE AN EXTRA PIN TO CONNECT IT TO YOUR AUX). The original pin that's attached to the cable would be a 3.5 mm jack.The cable however looks a little, you know, not so strong, that if not used carefully, eventually it might get damaged. Apart from that, this piece is perfect for Gamers who are Pubg freaks. This head phone gives you perfect audio quality to hear every single sound and also from the right Direction.This is perfect for music composers and recording studios. If used carefully this can act as a primary head phones in the studio.Cost is very affordable. The brand sennheiser itself speaks ! And Sennheiser making attempts to connect to the large masses by introducing a cost effective head phones is an amazing move ! Kudos !"
4,I had been planning on buying an over the ear headphones since a month. Finally bought this and I'd say I'm really satisfied. Let me clear a few flawed perceptions:1) This isn't low sounding: The sound is as good as any premium headphone2) The bass is well powered: The bass is really good and hits the ears only when the music has to be bass driven3) These are studio headphones but can be used well for daily listening.I used this on a redmi note 8 which is a mid range phone and the headphones were just great! This costs 999-1500 and daily music listeners aren't fond of precision or ACTUAL detailing. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a durable bass driven headphones
5,"It is an excellent product for a price as low as ‚Çπ1100! The over the ear headphones are very good and have the quality of 360 degree sound. There is a button for the mic to switch it on or off, which is very helpful in case of gaming. There is also a volume button and the braided cable is very protective. Even after long hours of gaming (6-7 hours), I couldn‚Äôt even feel a single bit of pain in my ears and the headphones have a variety of 7 RGB lights on either side of it. I highly recommend this product as per my experience for those who have long hours of gaming and are looking for a gaming headphone under the price of ‚Çπ1500. I have had the experience of playing games like PUBG, Rainbow Six Seige, etc. on the PS4 console. You can easily make out where the footsteps/noise is coming from, which is very helpful in games like these. Plus, the cable is very long which is helpful if your gamestation is a bit distant from your comfort place. So, I highly recommend this product!"
5,"First Let's talk about Build QualityIt's made of plastic but it does not feel cheap.It feels premium. Build Quality is Amazing.It's very comfortable. Overall cushioning is very good.You can wear them for hours and it will not be going to pain your ears.It comes with a Single 3.5 mm audio jack.So you can easily connect it with your Phone, PC or any device that has a 3.5 mm jack.Let's Talk about the main thing - Sound QualityWhile watching Videos or Listening SongsThe sound quality is Excellent.The bass is very good, Vocals are clearly audibleIn full volume, Its sound is very loudNoise Cancellation is also very good, If you listen to songs in full volumeYou will hear nothing that is happening outside.Like Talking of People, Vehicle sounds, etc.)I have tried a few games with it like PUBG, Call of Duty, Rocket League.I can easily spot the location of the enemy.Bullet fire sound was coming with full bass.My experience was Superb.Mic Quality is also good.It will not be coming with noise cancellation.So it will capture background sounds (fan sound, breathing sound, etc.)You also get RGB light in them at both the side.Just plug the USB cable in the port and you are done.The main thing is you can not control light manually.It will change automatically and after few minuteslight of both sides gets unsynced.This is not a problem but I thought I should tell you this too.Cable Quality is also very goodIt's like a tangle-free wire.There is a small problem with it:The USB cable and 3.5 mm audio cable is very close to each other.So if you are using a device in which the USB port and 3.5 mm audio port are a little far away from each other then you will able to connect only one port at atime in that device. (or by using  wire extension buying it separately)Let's talk about final conclusion.If you are having a tight budget and you are looking for a gaming headphone with RGB lightthen you can purchase them blindly."
4,"So First Of All I am an Competitive Gamer, I needed an headphone with rgb and also by a branded company last but not the least, budget.If You Are A Normal Begginer On Gaming, I will tell you purchase this blindly. But The Thing I'd Not Loved About This Product Is, Mic Doesn't Work In Pc, It's Aux Interface( Answer ToThose Who Will Tell That See Clearly There Are Usb And Aux Interface Available. No Usb Is For Rgb and rgb is also not controllable) Why I Hate Aux Is That's Why As After 2-3 Months Or Maybe After More Time One Speaker Of Headphone Gets Disabled Or The Audio Comes Only From One Speaker. I Have Used A Headphone Called Zebronics Zeb All Rounder, It was usb interface and I it worked till 1.4 Months.So, Please Check If You Are Purchasing Any Headphone, Never Go With Aux Interface. Don't Do Mistake Explained In The Brackets :)To Cosmic Byte,Please If You Can, Change The Interface:)And Last,Thank You For Seeing My ReviewIf It Turns Helpful, Please Click The Helpful Option,It will help me alot.Thanksx)"
1,Recived a tore box pasted with cello tape then i try to search invoice of the product but there was no invoice in the box. I opened the box and checked whether the headphones are properly working or not. Left side no sound and low sound quality. Feeling cheated . Don't buy this product there are many other good options. Worst seller ever. Finally returning the product
1,"Today i received the parcel. and upin hours of testing i find out that sound quality is not even near to gaming headphone. basically we use headphone to spot enemies but while using these headphone i was not able to spot the enemies instead footsteps sound was suppressed and gun fire was boosted which made my gaming experience even worse. On top of this they are not accepting return. WORST experience, please don't go for good reviews either they are paid or buyers don't know how gaming headphones really sound."
5,"I have received this product yesterday.I was scared by the reviews but when it was delivered, the packing was very good.I have used this for few hours and found it a very nice product. Sound quality, comfort, quality, etc everything is good.Value for money."

5,"i liked the way it delivers the audio,everything is so balanced.the bass, the noise cancellation, etc.i ordered gs420 earlier but that was a little heavy and didnt fit into my ear,  but this GS430 has high level comfort as compared to gs 420,  i feel no pain in this gs430,i can even play pubg for constant 3-4 hours ..tysm amazon and cosmic byte üòª"
3,"This is the packing of the item. No seals either. If Amazon wants to give Refurbished products to Customers then please mention it. Dont sell used items tagged as new. Quite disappointed.About Product:Works fine.Get a Equalizer if you want to use it anything else other than gaming.Cables are braided, quite happy with that.RGB Works too.Edit on 7 June 2021:Still working fine, although product looked refurbished it didnt malfunction anytime. No issues at all."
3,Video Player is loading.
3,Initially excited as the cushion of the headphone is very soft like a teddy bear but the sound quality is disappointing. crisp is missing and bass as well. good for kids online classes and games but not for movies and songs
3,"I know how difficult is to choose a product nowadays is. The Cosmicbyte Headphone is good enough to handle your daily work like Online classes, Zoom meetings & some gaming. Don't have big expectations from it. Sound is mild & just average. It's not the loudest you can get.  It's just ok ok. If you're getting it under or around 1K only then go for it."
5,"The product was delivered to me within 2hours of ordering and it was unsealed. Although it dint look used at all upon close inspection. The build quality is a notch up from the boat bassheads 900 I used earlier.Pros:1. The ear pads are cloth based and not totally leatherite. It's breathable.2. The lights are bright rgb and looks cool.3. The volume controller on the wire is a nifty addition and useful.4. The wire is very long and at 2.1meters it is usable by folding the wires to keep it from being messy. It's useful when playing the xbox though.5. I do not understand what is the boom mic all about but even with the mic folded up, people can hear me with extreme clarity and it does cut off the background rumble of fan, ac, children playing, tv, mixer.6. The headphone is more about clarity rather than bass. Hearing pleasant music like of ritviz is enjoyable while bassy music or hearing movies or marvel stuff the dialogues can actually be heard very clearly. Avenger scene was amazing.7. Being an over ear headphone, my ear fits perfectly inside the headphone cavity. It's bit sweaty and would like to request CosmicByte to come up with Ear pads too for this headphone.8. One of a kind graphics. I loved the black white camo but dint find the paint job worth an extra 500 bucks, 200 extra bucks like this one would be great. Gives a matt like finish.Cons:1. The ear pads are huge! It feels like those pilot headphones. Not exactly a con, but over time this might grow into an issue.2. The pattern of the lights are same all the time and doesnt change with music or gaming. Pretty monotonous to me.3. The volume controller is placed pretty far down the line. The headphone seems to have been designed more for a giant rather than us mere earthlings. The On/OFF switch is useless and doesnt do anything and is a mere show. It doesn't switch on/off the mic.4. The ear cups are not very snuggly fit and owing to the cloth pads, it does let outside sound pass right in. So in true terms its not really noise cancelling and can hear my mom yelling to me to come and eat.5. The mic goes up and down only and is faced towards father away from the face. Well its not a problem till I am hearable.6. It has bass, yes. But Bassheads 900 had higher bass and hearing rappers like Badshah using this might not ve a very pleasant experience.Games:Footsteps can be heard in PUBG. It is truly what they say, ""Unleash the God mode"".Overall:A decent headphone for WFH, Music and Games. Although this is not for an audiophile. Audio quality is best for the average mango man and gives an insight of how gaming truly feels."
4,"I was planning to use it for work and gaming. And while it works great for gaming and some of my work related stuff like listening to recordings, video clips etc.. its not so great when I want to just listen to some music n work! It feels like the music is muffled!But still happy with the product. Did I mention it's a great headphone for gaming? Definitely worth the price.PS - The packaging was very bad. Cloudtail is a decent seller (I have not had any issues with them product-wise ) but please improve your packaging, it's a make or break deal."
4,"TLDR - Good for the price, buy if this is your first ever gaming headset.The Good -1. Sound signature is good for games, music, meetings, movies, podcasts, etc.2. You can clearly hear the enemy's footsteps and direction irrespective of the game or platform.3. Breathable Earcups, no sweaty ears after long hours. (available only on camouflage models)4. RBG - good to have.5. Mic is good for gaming (and meetings too!).The Bad -1. No swivel on earcups whatsoever, the headset maintains a rigid shape and has some pressure points depending on your head shape.2. Annoying USB cable always hanging near the 3.5mm jack3. Cable is way too long for comfort, might be a good option for PC gaming, but annoying for console and mobile.4. Mic picks up everything (even the fan noise in my room!). Works best with silent surroundings.To conclude, I would like to say, it's good for your first gaming headset if you are on a TIGHT budget."
1,"Wish there was 0 star. Worst possible product. Delivery was on time. Thanks to Amazon.Pros:sound quality 6/10Build quality 7/10Cable quality 7/10Cons:Mic won't work. No point in of buying for gaming.Please remove the tag as gaming headphone, if mic does not work then no point in mentioning as it.Suggestion: invest in good brand for better quality and service.I raised return once and now raised for refund.Total waste of time!!"
5,"Bought it for online classes for my son after the teachers at his school complained about the mic quality. All those complaints are gone after I purchased the headset. Has a very strong cable so good for rough usage. Built quality is decent. Audio quality is pretty good, and what you can expect for this price. Overall I am very happy with the quality. Would definitely recommend buying this if you are looking for something good at this price range. Haven't tried any other headsets so I won't be able to compare with other brands."
5,Very nice and value added  product. Pricuct was as per description specifications it also has led light which glow once connected to any USB device. I am happy with the product and also with the delivery time.
4,All the things are awesome but there is just one thing that is not good. It's the noise cancelling of the mic. If you want a budget gaming headset then definitely go for this one
2,"I used this headphone for about 30mins and the weight of this headphone caused a lot of discomfort to my ears.If comfort is your first priority, i'd suggest you skip this and try something else.As for the audio quality. It is not that good but at this price, i suppose it is manageable"
5,"This is an amazing headset.Rgb- the lighting is nice a subtle and not too flashy,it's just the right amount,it is not controlable,it cycles and blends in 7 colorsBulid-it is a very sturdy bulid and good construction it also has a very cool mic construction tooSound- it has amazing sound and no distortion on full volume and the bass is amazing,the full headset starts moving so that is an amazing plus for meCompatibility- I have used this on xbox,pc, android and iOS and all devices did very well with no issues"
4,"Great Deal at this Price.Review After 5 Days of Delivery;I usually use it for online meetings & games( haven't tried FPP ), voice quality is excellent & Music( not for bass lovers, but we always have equilizer, which gives decent bass ).Build quality is superb especially the wire.The 7 RGB COLOUR s are great.I use it almost whole day , it's so Comfortable around the üëÇ.That's it go for it guys."

Headphone is good but nor for PUBG üî¥üî¥üî¥"
4,The product is just as mentioned. Have to say that I am really pleased with the quality of the packaging and the box that it came in. The cable seems very robust and not easily prone to wear and tear like other headphones. It is extremely long and would be very good if you just wanna sit back and watch a movie form a distance from your PC. Its got Good Bass!! but i do have to say that it does not the 7.1 surround sound. Apart from that everything is really good.
1,"The MIC is not working properly and the return button appeared just today or else I have to be waiting for decades to return the product Waste of Money on the product, So dissapointed."
3,"A very good choice at this price point.Pros-1.sound quality is good, the bass is not that thumpy but the overall sound quality is ballanced. And I kind of like it!2.the quality of rgb color panel used is awesome, I am in love with the color changing texture of the rgb panel‚ù§Ô∏è.3.the quality of wire is also good and reliable.4. The sound quality of mic is also great.Cons-1. It is too heavy to wear for an hour or more, my ears literally starts hurting after using it for an hour or more.2. nothing else!"
5,"Best Headphone at this price forget about Sony, jbl this one is mind blowing. The wire quality is awesome also sound is good but if you are a MUSIC LOVER then go for other. THIS IS SPECIALLY FOR GAMER AND MEETINGS."
5,I play cs go 90% of the time and sounds too goodPros : cable is braidedRgb is minimalToo good for Gaming can hear the footsteps and everythingSufficient wireMic gives good feedbackHas an on/off switchHas volume controlCons:Padding slightly cheap material usedQuality can be better 3/5Flat sound no bassOverall 3.8/5Very good value for under 1k
3,I bought this product after reading a lot of reviews. Basically my requirement was to get a headphone with a mic for daily long audio based meetings. Even though it met my requirements the right earphone isn't working after 3 months of usage.Pros:1.Mic is pretty good2.External noise is cut down well. I am often in meetings while there is welding or external noise nearby but participants don't feel any disturbance.3. Mute and volume switches are very helpful.4. A pretty long cordCons1. Right ear phone not working in 3 monthsNeutral - Not much use for the color lights other than showing kids
4,Video Player is loading.
5,"I was surprised to get such noise cancellation at the price it is. For people like me, those who exercise within their music segment, it is a hit and fit. Bass is decent, sound is flat but notes can be heard optimally. A must recommend to athletes."
5,"Excellent earphones, sound quality is very good, battery Backup is awsm.. just loved it.. go for it"
5,"I am fully satisfied with this neck band, build quality, connectivity, battery backup, sound and bass everything is superb."

5,Quality of material used is also good. Sound quality and battery backup is also good. Value for the money. Amazing product.
